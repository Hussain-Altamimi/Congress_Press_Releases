Title: Stefanik Statement On The Biden-Harris Plea Deal With The Terrorists Behind 9/11
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the Biden-Harris plea deal with the terrorists behind 9/11.

“On September 11, 2001, as the world watched the deadliest terrorist attack in American history, the American people rallied together in support of our nation and vowed to never forget.

The Biden-Harris Administration just shattered that promise and betrayed the American people. It is sickening that the Biden-Harris Department of Justice struck a plea deal with the al-Qaeda terrorists behind these horrific terrorist attacks. From the Iranian regime, to Hamas, and now 9/11 masterminds, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris continue to placate terrorists instead of holding them accountable for the atrocities they commit. This pattern of appeasement will only lead to more violence.

The families of the nearly 3,000 Americans killed on 9/11 and thousands of first responders who died from 9/11 health related illnesses, our service members, including 10th Mountain Division Soldiers, who gave their lives to eliminate terrorists like the ones that the Biden-Harris Administration are negotiating with, and the American people deserve a President that will honor their legacy and uphold the promise to never forget.”

Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto New York Governor Kathy Hochul urging her to submit a request for a Presidential disaster declaration to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) following flash flooding on July 10, 2024, that severely impacted counties and municipalities across New York’s 21st Congressional District.

Title: Stefanik, Cotton Demand Answers From Harris on Her National Security Advisor’s Connections with Iranian Influence Operation
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (NY-21) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) today sent aletterto Vice President Kamala Harris to express concern about her National Security Advisor, Philip Gordon, and his connections to senior Department of Defense official Ariane Tabatabai. Ms. Tabatabai was reportedly involved in an Iranian government operation to expand Iran’s influence in the United States.

“Kamala Harris’ National Security Advisor has concerningly close ties to a known Iranian agent within the Department of Defense and has brazenly published numerous pro-Iran opinion pieces exposing the depth of the Kamala Harris anti-Israel, pro-Iran agenda. Since last year, I have demanded accountability from the Department of Defense for allowing Iranian regime acolytes to infiltrate high level government staff. The Biden-Harris Administration policy of appeasing Iran and abandoning Israel will only worsen if Kamala Harris and her Iranian apologist staff are elevated. I am proud to join Senator Cotton to demand accountability,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

In the letter, the lawmakers wrote:

“Before joining your office, Mr. Gordon co-authored at least three opinion pieces with Ms. Tabatabai blatantly promoting the Iranian regime’s perspective and interests. In a March 2020 piece, Mr. Gordon and Ms. Tabatabai claimed continued sanctions on Iran would create ‘catastrophe’ in the Middle East. In another, they wrote sanctions could lead to new Iranian efforts to ‘lash out with attacks on its neighbors, and on Americans and American interests in the Middle East.’ Each prediction was as wrong, as it was biased in favor of Tehran.”

In September 2023, Stefanikleda letter demanding Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin provide members of the House Armed Services Committee and the American people transparency into their investigation of Ms. Tabatabai’s employment.

Title: Stefanik, Williams Requesting FEMA Assistance Following Destructive Storms in Upstate New York and the North Country
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined aletterwith members of the New York Republican Congressional Delegation led by Congressman Brandon Williams (R-NY) to the Biden-Harris Administration requesting a Presidential Emergency Declaration for the State of New York due to the devastating tornadoes, winds, and localized heavy rainfall that swept through New York State on July 15th and July 16th, 2024.

“My office has worked diligently to provide our Upstate New York and North Country communities with resources as we work to recover from the devastating storms that swept our district this month. I am now calling on the Biden-Harris Administration to issue a Presidential Emergency Declaration for the State of New York and unleash additional resources to help our NY-21 communities persevere through this tragedy and rebuild our communities,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“It is more important now than ever that we come together, across levels of government, to respond to the disaster that has struck our community. A Presidential Emergency Declaration would greatly aid ongoing efforts to provide relief to constituents who have been impacted, and I join my colleagues in supporting the Governor’s request,”said Congressman Brandon Williams.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“We represent the counties that are included in the Declaration request, which includes Chemung, Genesee, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Montgomery, Oswego, Oneida, Ontario, Saratoga, Schuyler, Stueben, and Warren Counties. Over ten tornados, five microbursts, and many severe thunderstorms which impacted New York State started on July 15th, killing at least one person, with more than 400,000 power outages due to downed trees and power lines. On July 16th, an EF-2 tornado touched down in the downtown area of the City of Rome, resulting in building collapses, significant infrastructure damage, and more than 28,000 customers without power in Oneida County.”

The lawmakers continue,“Included in the Governor’s request is financial assistance for eligible Category A and B expenses under FEMA’s Public Assistance program for activities such as debris removal, sheltering, evacuations, search and rescue, and other eligible activities. Additionally, a certification that State and local government obligations and expenditures for this disaster request will comply with all cost sharing requirements in the Stafford Act, and a request to waive the $5,000,000 limitation on assistance imposed by the Stafford Act, is included.”

Title: Stefanik, Banks Condemn DoDEA’s Integration of DEI in Education of our Service Members’ Children
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Chairman of the House Armed Service Committee’s Military Personnel Subcommittee Jim Banks (R-IN) led aletterto U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin condemning the Department of Defense Education Activity's (DoDEA) continued push to integrate DEI and progressive activism into curricula used to educate the children of U.S. service members. After years of oversight, the lawmakers are also calling for immediate leadership change at DoDEA.

A newreportfrom OpenTheBooks outlines the DoDEA’s use of professional development materials that hyper focus on concepts such as “privilege,” “institutional racism,” and “patriarchy” while training its teachers.

“Protecting our service members' children from the Biden-Harris Administration’s DoDEA remains one of my top priorities which is why I successfully led calls to dissolve their office of DEI and have my legislation, the Service Members’ Parents Bill of Rights, signed into law. Now I’m calling on Secretary Austin and the Biden-Harris Administration to completely end all efforts to indoctrinate our service members’ children with Far Left DEI propaganda. Our service members face many challenges and ensuring their children receive a high-quality patriotic education should not be one of them. I am proud to lead my colleagues in demanding that the Department of Defense remove radical Far Left ideology from their classrooms,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“It is shameful and unsustainable that while our servicemen and women are risking their lives to defend our nation, their children are being taught that America is a racist country not worth fighting for. My House Republican colleagues and I will continue to expose and eradicate the woke indoctrination that is destroying our service-members’ trust in DoDEA schools,”said Chairman Jim Banks (R-IN).

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The recent OpenTheBooks report shines light on new examples of DoDEA teachers eager to promote sexually explicit content to children, reveals training materials designed to get children to cry, and classroom content ingrained with Social and Emotional Learning practices intended to turn students into radical activists. Instead of disbanding the DEI division, DoDEA has institutionalized radical social and racial ideologies through the promotion of books such as How to be an Antiracist and Coaching for Equity to their staff for professional development. These books are blatantly racist towards hundreds of millions of Americans and delegitimize the founding of America itself. The teachers of our service members’ children cannot internalize, accept, and regurgitate false claims that America’s existence as a sovereign nation should be in question. This is inherently in opposition to the selfless choice our service members make to serve, protect, and defend the United States of America.”

The lawmakers continue,“It is completely unacceptable that once again House Republicans must remind you and the entire DoD that the mission of DoDEA is to provide our service members’ children with an education that instills high academic standards and patriotism, not to manipulate and radicalize the minds of our youth. Your continuous refusal to end the radicalization of DoDEA schools is disrespectful to our service members, will exacerbate the military recruitment and retention crisis, and significantly degrade operational readiness.”

When Stefanik heard concerns from parents regarding DoDEA schools teachingradical gender ideologieswith DoDEA training materials, sheintroducedaServicemember Parents Bill of Rights, which reinforces that service members with children in DoDEA schools have the right to be involved in their children’s education, while increasing transparency and accountability in DoDEA schools. Stefanik legislation was included in the FY2024National Defense Authorization Actwhichpassedin December 2023.

In September 2022, Stefanik and Congressman Franklindemanded answersfrom the Pentagon regarding troubling statements made by Wing. Following this advocacy, the Department of Defense, through the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, announced they werelaunching a 30-day reviewof Wing and her racist, woke posts. In November 2022, theyfollowed upwith Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin requesting an update on the findings of the review, and had not received an answer until three hours prior to today’s hearing.

Representatives Stefanik and Banks were joined by Representatives Rob Wittman (R-VA), Mike Waltz (R-FL), Ronny L. Jackson (R-TX), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Sam Graves (R-MO), Rich McCormick (R-GA), Scott DesJarlis (R-TN), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Mark Alford (R-MO), Cory Mills (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Brad Finstad (R-MN), James Moylan (R-Guam), Lance Gooden (R-TX), and Carlos Gimenez (R-FL).

Title: Stefanik Statement on Hezbollah’s Violent Attack Against Israelis At Playground And Soccer Field
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement responding to Hezbollah’s violent attack against innocent Israelis at a playground and soccer field in Majdal Shams today.

"My heart breaks for the Israelis, including many children, who were killed in Hezbollah’s violent attack against a playground and soccer field in Majdal Shams. The images from the attack are a horrific reminder of the barbaric Iranian-backed existential threats that Israel faces daily.

Israel has a legal right and moral obligation to protect its civilians from Hezbollah’s attacks. Israel is on the front lines of Iran’s violent ambition to destroy the West and our shared values. This is why I led a letter with Senator Hagerty demanding that the Biden-Harris Administration clearly state their support for Israel’s right to defend its borders against Hezbollah. The Biden-Harris Administration must immediately end all of the holds they have on weapons shipments to Israel and put pressure on the United Nations to enforce UNSCR 1701 and demilitarize Hezbollah. The Biden-Harris’s Administration’s abdication of leadership on the world stage emboldened Iran and our great ally Israel is facing the consequences. We must return to President Trump’s peace through strength policies."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Delivers Remarks on House Floor Condemning Kamala Harris for Her Role as Open Border Czar
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik spoke on the House Floor about herresolutionto condemn Kamala Harris for her role as Joe Biden’s open border czar and their failed policies which have created the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.

Watch her full remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below:

“I rise to condemn Vice President Kamala Harris for her failed and dangerous policies as Joe Biden's border czar that caused the most catastrophic border crisis in modern history. No matter what congressional district you go to, the number one issue facing Americans is Kamala Harris’ open border crisis. And by every metric, Kamala Harris has failed to secure our borders, instead advancing Far Left Democrats’ failed open border policies and the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of Americans.

This resolution condemns Kamala Harris’ role as Joe Biden's open border czar and affirms that the American people deserve elected officials who understand the gravity of the crisis at the border and who will work to secure the border.

Now Democrats will try to run from this record, but they cannot hide. Joe Biden’s open border czar Kamala Harris and every elected Democrat is responsible for this border crisis along with every other aspect of Joe Biden’s failed and feckless record which brought not only the border crisis, but skyrocketing Bidenflation, surging violent crimes, chaos and weakness around the world.

We all remember the widely publicized delegation that Vice President Kamala Harris conducted and led saying, ‘Do not come. Do not come.’ And millions of illegals poured into our country since then because of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s Administration’s unconstitutional, illegal, executive actions, wiping away President Trump's effective border security policies which created the most secure border in modern history. The American people know that.

In fact, just last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced over 130,000 illegal immigrant encounters at our Southern Border in June. This is roughly 4,300 illegal encounters at our Southern Border a day which is four times more than the definition of a ‘crisis’ set by Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. So far this fiscal year, there have been 93 individuals whose names appear on the terrorist watchlist who were stopped trying to enter the U.S. illegally between ports of entry at the Southern Border. That’s over 500 since Kamala Harris was assigned the border czar role.

And on our Northern Border in the Swanton Sector which I represent, I have seen firsthand with the Border Patrol the disastrous consequences of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s Administration’s failed Far Left open border agenda which caused a historic surge in illegal crossings–the likes of which we have never seen on a Northern Border before including individuals on the terrorist watchlist. And this is not just a national security crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis. Under Kamala Harris’ role as Joe Biden‘s border czar, nearly 80,000 minors have been lost, left, slipped through the cracks. This is also part of the violent crime crisis surge concerning every single American. Look in Upstate New York. A 21-year-old innocent girl was killed by an illegal and buried in a Syracuse public park. A 15-year-old innocent girl was raped by an illegal in Albany County all because of Kamala Harris’ failed policies as open border czar.

Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are to blame for this historic crisis. Their policies stopped the construction of the border wall, ended President Trump’s Remain in Mexico, and released the largest number of illegals in the United States in history. Since Kamala Harris became the open border czar, monthly encounters have surpassed even the highest month under President Trump. The number of illegals released into the country have skyrocketed. Former U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz stated that during his two years in the position, he had never once spoken to Vice President Harris. Even worse, Vice President Harris has never even spoken with the current border patrol chief since he was appointed in July 2023. This is unacceptable.

The American people have had enough. They know that the only way to fix this historic crisis is by returning to President Trump’s effective border security policies. That is why House Republicans passed H.R. 2, the strongest border security bill in history, the Secure the Border Act of 2023, that will put an end to this catastrophic border crisis caused by Joe Biden and his open border czar Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris has failed in overseeing Americans’ safety by refusing to secure the border. She has proved that she is unfit to lead, and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox News’ America’s Newsroom To Discuss Democrats Boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Congressional Address To Appease Their Pro-Hamas Base
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joinedFox Newsto discuss Kamala Harris and Far Left Democrats' boycott of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Congressional Address and reaffirmed that House Republicans will always stand with our most precious ally Israel.

Stefanik also highlighted herresolutionto condemn Harris' role as Biden's open border czar emphasizing how every elected Democrat owns these catastrophic and failed open border policies.

Watch the full interview here.

Find highlights from the interview below.

On the Disgraceful Democrat Party Boycotting Prime Minister Netanyahu:

“Well, this is a snub, and it is a boycott. And it is absolutely a disgrace that the sitting Vice President of the United States would not attend what I believe will be one of the most important speeches at one of the gravest national security threats that the world faces. That is the bloodiest day for the Jewish people when Hamas attacked–a terrorist group backed by Iran– attacked Israel, our most precious ally. So it is inexcusable, but, Dana, this is where the Democrat Party is today. As Bill Hemmer just said, that number is going to be over 80 Democrats who boycott this important joint address. House Republicans are committed to strongly supporting Israel. We will continue to show that moral and national security leadership on the world stage. And Prime Minister Netanyahu is making history today. This will be the head of state who has delivered the most joint addresses to the United States Congress, beating Winston Churchill. I think back to my freshman term in 2015. Prime Minister Netanyahu delivered another historic speech to Congress–it was the first one I ever attended–talking about his opposition to the flawed Iranian nuclear agreement. And you know who boycotted that? Joe Biden when he was vice president. So this is today’s Democrat Party. It’s a disgrace.”

On Democrats Siding with Terrorists Instead of Our Precious Ally Israel:

“It’s because they are becoming the pro-terrorist wing of the Democrat Party. Again, take a step back, Dana. Israel is a growing democracy, the strongest democracy, the only democracy in the Middle East. They have respect for human rights, and they have a right to defend themselves. What I hope and I believe we will hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu is how we are going to eradicate the terrorists who slaughtered civilians in Israel, beheaded babies, burnt women, and have eight Americans who were abducted and kidnapped who are being burrowed away in tunnels among the terrorist regime in Gaza. So we, as the United States, need to strongly stand with Israel. House Republicans are committed to doing so, and President Trump was the strongest U.S. President when it comes to supporting Israel. Compare that with Kamala Harris who is refusing to attend this address.”

On Resolution Condemning Border Czar Kamala Harris’ Role in the Open Border Crisis:

“She’s on her back foot. She’s gonna even be more on her back foot. And I think we’re at a high watermark for Kamala Harris’ polling. It’s going to go lower. She was designated by Joe Biden as the border czar, and what has happened is the most catastrophic open border in our nation’s history. The number one issue no matter what congressional district, no matter what state you  poll, is this border crisis, and Kamala Harris owns it lock, stock, and barrel. She oversaw the gravest national security threat, economic threat, the fact that 500 individuals on the terrorist watchlist crossed the border illegally during Kamala Harris’ role as border czar. She owns this border crisis, and it’s going to be a driving factor going into this election cycle. And again, Dana, as Democrats in backroom deals didn’t allow voters across this country to select their nominee, Kamala Harris has been designated by Democrat donors and Democrat elites. But the American people are smart. They know that she owns the failures of the Biden-Harris Administration whether it’s the border crisis, whether it’s the historic inflation crisis, and voters are going to hold her accountable. Compare that to the success, the most secure border in modern history under President Trump and the booming economy. So I think it will be a stark contrast and choice this election cycle this November, and President Trump is going to win on these issues.”

Washington, D.C. -Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress.

“I’m proud to welcome Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to our nation’s Capitol at a time when ensuring strong U.S. support for Israel is more critical than ever,”said Chairwoman Elise Stefanik.“Since Hamas’s barbaric October 7th terrorist attack against Israel it has never been more clear that Israel is serving as a bulwark against Iran’s violent aspirations in the Middle East. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech is a stark reminder that Israel is currently facing existential threats from Iranian-sponsored proxies on multiple different fronts and the U.S. cannot abandon our ally as they fight against this evil. As I said during my address to the Israeli Knesset, we will not rest until every hostage kidnapped during the horrific October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks is returned home. While the Biden-Harris Administration blocked aid to Israel, eased sanctions on Iran, and paid the world’s leading state sponsor of terror billions of dollars in ransom money and waivers extensions, House Republicans have stood strongly with Israel. America is firmly behind Israel and the Jewish people.”

Title: Stefanik, Hagerty Demand Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Support Israel’s Right to Defend Itself Against Hezbollah
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) led alettertoJoe Biden demanding the Biden-Harris Administration clearly state their unwavering support for Israel’s right to defend its sovereign borders against Hezbollah’s illegal attacks. Since October 7th, Hezbollah has fired thousands of missiles, drones, and rockets over Israel’s northern border forcing tens of thousands Israelis to evacuate their homes and violating UN Security Council Resolution 1701 yet the Biden-Harris Administration has not clearly stated their support for Israel’s right to defend itself against these attacks.

“The Biden-Harris Administration has completely failed to stand with our most precious ally Israel. The U.S. must clearly support Israel’s right to defend its sovereign borders against Hezbollah’s persistent attacks which have killed dozens of Israeli civilians and decimated the agricultural production of northern Israel. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ failure to support the only democracy in the Middle East undermines America’s national security interests and has emboldened the violent Iranian regime,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“We write to express our strong support for Israel’s right to self-defense amid the intensifying attacks that Israel faces from Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon. Since Hamas’s barbaric October 7 attacks across Israel’s southern border, Israel has endured over 19,000 Iranian-backed missile and drone attacks from all fronts. Hezbollah alone has launched over 5,820 rocket, missile, and drone attacks into northern Israel that have killed 33 Israelis and forced more than 60,000 Israelis to uproot their lives and flee their homes. Israel should not have to live under constant fear of aerial attack and has the legal right and moral obligation to defend its sovereign borders and its people. Hence, we urge you to unequivocally support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah’s attacks, and to provide in a timely manner the support necessary to restore peace and security.”

The lawmakers continue,“It is disappointing that your administration’s policy towards the conflict on Israel’s northern border is ambiguous at best. America should not be neutral when it comes to the conflict between Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, and Hezbollah, the Iranian regime’s most lethal terrorist proxy. In early June, Hezbollah dramatically increased their missile and drone attacks against Israel and your administration, out of fear of escalation, responded by cautioning Israel against responding. Additionally, your administration continues to block the transfer of 2,000-pound bombs, F-15 fighter aircraft, and other U.S.-made defense articles needed in Israel. These decisions have exacerbated perceived tensions and divisions between the United States and Israel, empowered Hezbollah terrorists, and impeded Israel’s efforts to defend itself. A failure to fully support Israel’s right to self-defense in both word and deed undermines U.S. national security interests and risks breaking faith with our nation’s ironclad commitment to Israel.”

View a transcript of her remarks below:

“Last week in Milwaukee was the most exciting, unifying, and strongest Republican convention in modern political history. The American people are rallying around President Donald J. Trump and his America first agenda.

Compare that to the Democrat Party that is in absolute free fall. Back-room donors, Democrat elites, and their stenographers in the mainstream media conspired in a direct attack on democracy which overturned the will of 14 million Democrat voters who elected Joe Biden as their nominee.

And make no mistake, the American people know that Kamala Harris owns Joe Biden’s catastrophic and failed policies from the inflation crisis, to the energy crisis, to the crime crisis. And the number one issue facing Americans, no matter what district across America, is the border crisis, and Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's open border czar. By every metric, Harris has failed to secure our borders, advancing Far Left Democrats' failed open border policies and the needs of illegals over the safety of American citizens. Yesterday, I introduced a resolution condemning Kamala Harris' role as Biden's open border czar. Every elected Democrat, is responsible for this border crisis along with every other aspect of Biden's failed and feckless record which brought skyrocketing Bidenflation, surging violent crimes, chaos, and weakness around the world.

Looking to tomorrow, at the Speaker’s invitation, we will proudly welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. This address comes at a time when Israel is fighting against barbaric terrorists backed by Iran for their very right to exist. House Republicans will always stand with Israel and will not rest until every hostage kidnapped during the horrific October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks is returned home. While we have repeatedly–House Republicans have repeatedly–voted in favor of providing Israel with necessary military aid, the Biden-Harris Administration and Far Left Democrats have turned their backs on our most precious ally electing to withhold this aid and side with the radical, pro-terrorist base of today’s Democrat Party. It has never been more crucial to show the world that America stands unequivocally with our most precious ally Israel.

It has been ten days since the horrific assassination attempt on President Trump. Yesterday, we heard from the Secret Service Director Cheatle who provided no new updates, was unable to answer the most basic questions, and confirmed to everyone that she is not qualified to keep our nation leaders safe. She must resign. The American people deserve answers, and House Republicans will not rest until we have transparency and accountability.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Houthi Terror Attack Near U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv
Date: 2024

Content:
Saratoga, N.Y. -House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik released the following statement condemning the Iranian-backed Houthi drone attack near the U.S. Consulate in Tel Avivand extending condolences to the Israeli people.

“The Iranian-backed Houthi drone attack near the U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv makes it once again clear that Iran and its terrorist proxies seek the destruction of both Israel and the United States.

Since the creation of the state of Israel, our great ally has served as a bulwark against Iran’s violent ambitions and Islamic extremism in the Middle East. However, through reversing President Trump’s designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, refusing to enforce oil sanctions on Iranian oil, and continuing to renew waiver extensions to the Iranian regime, Joe Biden has abandoned Israel and emboldened Iran.

I am extending my condolences to the Israeli civilians who were impacted by this attack and am praying for those injured. We cannot continue to allow Iran to be emboldened by weak American leadership. It is time to return to President Trump’s Maximum Pressure Campaign and peace through strength policies.”

Date: 2024

Milwaukee, Wisconsin -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the below statement following a recommendation by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to close Great Meadow and Sullivan Correctional Facilities.

“I am calling on Governor Kathy Hochul to reverse her disastrous decision to close correctional facilities across New York State which will impact hundreds of jobs, unravel communities, and overcrowd our remaining prisons making them more dangerous for our law enforcement officers. Hochul’s careless prison closures abandons our hardworking correctional officers and the communities they work tirelessly to keep safe. Instead of addressing low staffing and retention issues, Hochul has used the opportunity to advance the Far Left Democrats’ agenda of rewarding criminals and punishing the victims of their crimes. This will end in disaster for the Empire State,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Title: Stefanik, Ernst Reintroduce Legislation to Ensure Reporting And Public Disclosure Of Government Funding Sent to Communist China
Date: 2024

Content:
Milwaukee, Wisconsin -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) in reintroducing theTracking Receipts to Adversarial Countries for Knowledge of Spending (TRACKS) Actwhich requires the reporting and public disclosure of every penny from a government grant or contract that is provided to an entity located in a foreign country of concern including Communist China, Russia, North Korea, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

This legislation provides crucial information on the dollar amount, location, and purpose for this funding and would be reported to the federal government and made publicly available online for the American public. The reintroduction of this legislation comes following the release of the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General’sreportfinding that the DoD is not tracking defense dollars that may be going to Communist China.

“I am proud to join Senator Joni Ernst in reintroducing the TRACKS Act ensuring that no American taxpayer dollars are used to fund our foreign adversaries. It is inexcusable that the Department of Defense publicly admitted that they are not tracking taxpayer dollars going to Communist China,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“We cannot allow a single penny from hardworking Americans to go to foreign adversaries actively working against America and our interests. This desperately needed legislation ensures that bureaucrats are held accountable for their reckless and irresponsible spending that is lining the pockets of countries like Communist China.”

“This alarming Inspector General investigation demonstrates Washington hasn’t learned any lessons from COVID-19. Without my calls to audit DoD spending, these dollars wasted on our adversaries would have never been unmasked. Taxpayers deserve an explanation as to why the Pentagon was funding a controversial biotech company in China to create drug-resistant, mutant coronaviruses in the midst of the pandemic most likely sparked by the risky research funded by the U.S. government in another lab in China. It’s clear a much deeper investigation is warranted into all of this, and I am calling for one,”said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA).“It’s also shocking the Biden administration is hiring an army of IRS agents to audit U.S. taxpayers but can’t keep track of where tax dollars are being spent overseas. My TRACKS Act, which is being introduced in the House today by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, will require every penny sent to China or any other country of concern be accounted for and the receipts be publicly posted. Then we can work to ensure American taxpayers never again aid the dangerous experiments of mad scientists in China.”

Title: Stefanik, Walberg Push Back on Harvard’s Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism’s Failed Preliminary Recommendations
Date: 2024

Content:
Milwaukee, Wisconsin -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) in leading aletterto Harvard University Interim President Alan Garber expressing serious concerns over the inadequacy of Harvard’s Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism’sPreliminary Recommendationsthat were released on June 6. Jewish leaders at Harvard as well as alumni havelabeledthe recommendations as insufficient for not addressing faculty issues, concerns with DEI, and not calling on Harvard to end its relationship with Birzeit University in the West Bank.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The Preliminary Recommendations reaffirm what has been known for months. Harvard has a serious problem with antisemitism on its campus, including ‘derision and exclusion’ of Israeli students, discrimination and harassment of students by faculty and teaching fellows, and political litmus tests in extracurricular student life. While the Preliminary Recommendations rightly call for substantive discipline and public condemnation in response to this hateful misconduct, they fail to offer real solutions for doing so.”

The lawmakers continue,“Instead of offering a tangible plan to address antisemitism at Harvard, the task force’s most specific and actionable recommendations are to organize public talks on respectful dialogue and religious relations, increase the availability of hot kosher meals, and to circulate guidance about accommodating Jewish religious observance and a calendar of Jewish holidays. The inadequacy of the Preliminary Recommendations is particularly alarming given that Harvard’s leaders had already received a strong, detailed, and comprehensive set of recommendations from the AAG on December 18, 2023, which identified eight goals and 38 steps for combating antisemitism. Rather than build on these recommendations by presenting concrete plans for implementing them, the task force took six months to reinvent the wheel and offer an inferior set of recommendations.”

Stefanik and Walberg are joined by Reps. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Jim Banks (R-IN), Aaron Bean (R-FL), Jason Smith (R-MO), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY), Randy Feenstra (R-IA), Russell Fry (R-SC), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Michael Guest (R-MS), Erin Houchin (R-IN), Ronny Jackson (R-TX), Nick LaLota (R-NY), Nicholas Langworthy (R-NY), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Burgess Owens (R-UT), Keith Self (R-TX), Pete Sessions (R-TX), Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), Michelle Steel (R-CA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), Randy Weber (R-TX), and Rudy Yakym (R-IN).

“I applaud Judge Aileen Cannon for having the courage and wisdom to dismiss corrupt Jack Smith’s unconstitutional witch hunt against President Trump. As I have been saying from the beginning, this sham case against President Trump violated our Constitution. Only Congress can create new officers and spend taxpayer money. However, Biden’s corrupt Department of Justice tried to shred the Constitution with the appointment of their so called “special counsel” Jack Smith as part of their desperate illegal lawfare campaign against President Trump.

Today marks a historic victory for our Constitution and the rule of law. This dismissal is not just a win for President Trump but a triumph for the principles our nation was founded upon.

Title: ICYMI: Chair Stefanik: “There Is No Longer Any Doubt That Joe Biden Is Unfit To Be Our Commander In Chief”
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —In case you missed it, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how Far Left Democrats and the mainstream media are in complete disarray because they have been caught participating in one of the greatest coverups in American history.

Stefanik also emphasized how House Republicans are safeguarding American elections by ensuring only American citizens can vote in American elections by bringing the SAVE Act to the House Floor. Additionally, House Republicans are blocking Joe Biden's radical efforts to roll back women's rights by changing Title IX to allow biological males in women's spaces.

Watch her full remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below:

“There is no longer any doubt that Joe Biden is unfit to be our commander in chief. The Biden White House, Far Left House Democrats, and the mainstream media are in complete disarray because they know this to be true and have been caught participating in one of the greatest media coverups in American history.

For the last three and half years, House Republicans and the American people have been demanding details about Joe Biden's mental and physical decline. But every time we raised these legitimate concerns, Far Left Democrats and their loyal stenographers in the mainstream media rushed to Biden's defense, claiming that the clearly diminished Joe Biden was as sharp as ever and accusing us of peddling conspiracy theories. The coverup is over, and accountability is here.

For years, House Republicans have known that Joe Biden is unfit for office. We also know that he will go to any lengths to maintain his grip on power. This is why it is so crucial that we take every possible measure to ensure that the 2024 presidential election is free from election interference and is constitutional. As part of that ongoing effort, House Republicans are bringing to the Floor this week Congressman Chip Roy's Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act which requires individuals to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Not surprisingly, the Biden White House, whose Far Left open border agenda has let in millions–over 10 million–illegal immigrants, is against our bill. This is a very simple and logical concept rooted in the Constitution. Only American citizens should vote in American elections.

Also this week, House Republicans are moving Mary Miller’s CRA to stop Joe Biden’s radical efforts to roll back women’s rights and change Title IX to allow biological men to access women and girls’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports.

Next week, we are looking forward to uniting in Milwaukee behind President Donald J. Trump's America First agenda which created the greatest economy in generations, the securest border in modern history, the lowest gas prices in years, and peace through strength around the world. With that, we’re honored to be joined by Chip Roy who is leading the SAVE Act this week on the Floor.”

Title: Stefanik Bills Advance through Ways and Means Committee Following Markup

Washington, D.C. -Today, theUniversity Accountability Actand theProtecting American Students Act,which Congresswoman Elise Stefanik introduced with Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) and Congresswoman Drew Ferguson (R-GA) respectively, advanced through the Committee on Ways and Means. Passage during today’s markup sets this bill up for consideration on the House floor.

“I am proud to see the University Accountability Act and the Protecting American Students Act advance through committee as I continue my efforts to combat antisemitism on college campuses across the country. These universities were warned that their failure to adequately stand up for our Jewish students and community on campus would lead to consequences and today House Republicans are another step closer to delivering on that promise,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

TheUniversity Accountability Actwill impose penalties on education institutions who fail to protect the civil rights of their students after antisemitic incidents on college campuses increased by 700% following the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th, 2023.

Title: Stefanik, Ferguson Introduce the Protecting American Students Act In Response to Universities' Failure to Protect Jewish Students
Date: 2024

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congresswoman Drew Ferguson (R-GA) in introducing theProtecting American Students Actto ensure that only American students are counted towards endowment tax calculations.

The bill amends the scope of the Endowment Tax calculation to only account for students eligible for federal financial assistance under theHigher Education Act. This includes students who are a citizen, national, or permanent resident of the United States or able to provide evidence from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he or she is in the United States for other than a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident. The bill does not include students who are in the U.S. temporarily or on a student visa. By excluding noncitizens from the calculation, this legislation would add approximately 10 schools to the 35 that currently qualify, including Columbia University.

“In my continued effort to hold education institutions accountable that fail to protect Jewish students, I am leading legislation that will penalize universities for their negligence in dealing with hostile and antisemitic mobs on their campus,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“The rising antisemitic behavior on college campuses is beyond unacceptable, and many leaders of these movements are international students,”said Congressman Drew Ferguson.“United States educational institutions should not be rewarded with generous tax benefits while condoning this behavior, and the Protecting American Students Act ensures these universities create a safe environment for all students.”

In April 2024, Congresswoman Elise Stefaniksentaletterto Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, demanding action on Columbia University’s campus as Columbia President Minouche Shafik continues to allow an unsanctioned mob of students and agitators to harass and threaten Jewish students and community members.

East Greenbush, N.Y. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) in introducing theUniversity Accountability Actto impose penalties on education institutions who fail to protect the civil rights of their students after antisemitic incidents on college campusesincreasedby 700% following the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th, 2023.

“I will continue to lead the efforts ridding our higher education institutions of antisemitism. With this new legislation, the University Accountability Act, we will impose penalties on universities who violate the civil rights of their own students including by failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic hate. Hardworking taxpayers have no interest in funding institutions that fail to protect their students from antisemitic rhetoric and behavior and this bill puts their tax-exempt status on the chopping block,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

"Universities have a responsibility to protect their students from violence and

discrimination and instead we're seeing a disturbing increase in antisemitic attacks and rhetoric on college campuses,"said Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis."If these schools are receiving generous tax benefits from the federal government at the expense of American taxpayers, they should be doing more than simply giving a slap on the wrist to perpetrators of hate. Our legislation seeks to hold these institutions accountable with lofty financial punishments that would encourage them to investigate and crack down on instances of antisemitism and help foster a safer a safer academic environment for all students, regardless of their gender, race or religion."

Under current federal law, a violation ofTitle VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, can result in the loss of federal funds, but often times results in a mere corrective action that would bring the college or university back into compliance. TheUniversity Accountability Actwould require colleges and universities that meet the penalty criteria to pay a fine of either five percent of the school's aggregate administrative compensation as reported on the school's Form 990, or $100,000, whichever is greater. After three civil rights violations, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would be required to review the college or university's tax-exempt status for possible revocation.

“As families and communities across our nation prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July, I am once again reminded of the pivotal role our region played in the fight for America’s freedom and independence,”Congressman Paul Tonko said.“With the designation of “Saratoga National Battlefield Park,” the importance of this national park will be better and more accurately reflected. I’m proud to join Congresswoman Stefanik in introducing this legislation.”

Saratoga County Board of Supervisors Chairman and Saratoga 250th Commissioner Phil Barrett said,“Saratoga County thanks Congresswoman Stefanik and Congressman Tonko for carrying this legislation to restore the Saratoga National Historical Park to Saratoga National Battlefield Park. The Battles of Saratoga, which took place on this hallowed ground, were a pivotal turning point in the American Revolutionary War, marking the first time in world history that a British Army laid down their arms. This name change would distinguish the park as a historical battlefield and provide a unique identifier to clearly inform tourists of the significance of the park to American independence.”

"With America's and the Battles of Saratoga 250th anniversaries fast approaching, we are grateful Congresswoman Stefanik and Congressman Tonko are answering Saratoga County and area stakeholders' call to rename our vital Revolutionary park after the battlefield victory that changed the world. America's Turning Point in our War for Independence happened here.

“I’m proud to announce that I helped secure nearly $4.4 million in funding to complete important projects throughout our Upstate and North Country communities via NBRC which will spur economic growth and community development,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Bringing investments back to our community remains one of my top priorities which is why I introduced legislation to reauthorize the NBRC for ten years. I look forward to continuing to bolster NBRC’s efforts to enhance rural healthcare and encourage job creation across NY-21.”

On Joe Biden Not Being Mentally Fit to be President Following The Worst Debate Performance In Modern History:

“Well, it's because they're trying to cover up the feebleness, and the fact that, I believe, Sean, that they edited the transcript that they turned over to Congress.”

“I think it's worse. I know we're going to work as House Republicans to use every tool at our disposal to hold the Department of Justice and the Biden Administration accountable for not turning over those tapes. It's our constitutional responsibility.”

“We are focused on passing the appropriations bills, but let's talk about what's most important. What voters are concerned about when it comes to the tapes and this old, unfit individual who is President of the United States. We saw that on the debate stage today: the worst debate performance in modern history from Joe Biden versus the strength of President Trump.”

….

“Well, Democrats are in freefall. This is a disaster for Democrats. Joe Biden is who Donald Trump is going to defeat this November. That's what we’re focused on.”

Title: Stefanik, Ogles Introduce the Confronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Act
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led the introduction of theConfronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Actwith Congressman Andy Ogles (R-TN) and Chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) John Moolenaar (R-MI) to direct the Biden Administration to re-list Communist China’s Ministry of Public Security’s (MPS) Institute of Forensic Science on the U.S.’s Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce’s Entity List.

The CCP’s Institute of Forensic Science wassanctionedby the Trump Administration for using DNA to track its own people and collect genetic information on Uyghur detainees. The Biden Administration removed trade sanctions against the MPS’s Institute of Forensic Science in November.

“Joe Biden has unacceptably chosen to reward a Communist Chinese company despite their genocidal crimes and human rights abuses against the Uyghur population and other ethnic minorities. This legislation to relist China’s Institute of Forensic Science on our Entity List will return us to President Trump’s peace through strength strategy and ensure no U.S. technology is benefiting Communist China’s human rights abuses,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a long and sordid history of human rights abuses, and its Institute of Forensic Science is no exception. President Trump took decisive action to sanction the Institute in June 2020, placing it on the Entity List for its material support for the genocide of the Uighurs. President Biden lifted the sanctions in November 2023 and removed the Institute from the Entity List – without proving that the Institute had stopped participating in mass slaughter,”said Congressman Andy Ogles.“It’s past time for the US to confront the CCP’s human rights abusers, and Congress will have to lead in the absence of a strong Commander-in-Chief. I am incredibly grateful for the support of the Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Moolenaar and GOP Conference Chairwoman Stefanik.”

“Secretary Blinken has often argued that human rights should be at the forefront of our foreign policy. Unfortunately, the administration did not follow its own principle when it delisted a Chinese entity implicated in genocide in exchange for yet more unproductive talks about fentanyl—even though we now know the Chinese Communist Party is fueling that crisis. Rewarding the CCP for committing one human rights atrocity will only empower it to worsen the others,”said Chairman John Moolenaar.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox Business To Discuss Rallying Behind President Trump, The Catastrophic Humanitarian Crisis Created By Joe Biden’s Border Crisis, and More
Date: 2024

Content:
Atlanta, GA –In case you missed it, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox Business’The Bottom Line with Dagen McDowell and Sean Duffy,from Atlanta ahead of the first presidential debate, to discuss the catastrophic humanitarian crisis created by Joe Biden’s failed Far Left Democrat open borders and the need to return to President Trump’s peace through strength policies.

View the full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On House Republicans Rallying Behind President Trump:

“Well, first of all, I'm proud to be in Atlanta, Georgia as one of the top surrogates for President Trump. I think what the American people are going to see tonight is a stark contrast of the weak, failed feckless leadership of Joe Biden that has created catastrophic crises whether it's the border crisis, the inflation crisis, the war on American energy, or the weakness and chaos around the world that has weakened our national security. Compare that with the success of President Donald Trump's presidency: record economic growth. You saw peace through strength with a strong Commander in Chief. You saw a booming economy and energy independence. So this will be a stark contrast tonight, and House Republicans are proud to be unified in support of President Trump as the American people are continuing to show greater and greater support for President Trump as shown in swing state polling which is historic across the country.”

On The Humanitarian Crisis And Tragic Loss Of Life Created By Joe Biden’s Border Crisis:

“This is reprehensible. This is the heinous human side of this humanitarian crisis that Joe Biden's wide open border has created whether it's Jocelyn Nungaray, Laken Riley and their poor families who are mourning the loss of their beloved daughters, these innocent, young women, or this breaking news in Albany, New York, which is where I grew up in Upstate New York. The fact that you had a fifteen-year-old violently raped by an illegal. In Syracuse, New York, you had a twenty-one-year-old murdered on her birthday, and buried at the Syracuse public park by an illegal. This is the humanitarian travesty from Joe Biden's wide open border, and this is why House Republicans passed the Secure the Border Act. This is why, when President Trump talks about securing the border, he did it. We had the most secure border in our nation's history because of President Trump's strong policies. So this will be a key issue that will be discussed. No amount of talking points for Joe Biden. is going to make up for the humanitarian losses of innocent lives because of this illegal crisis because of Joe Biden's wide open border.

…

“That's right, Sean, and the fact that these young losses of life, again, twelve-year-olds, fifteen-year-olds, twenty-one-year-olds on their birthday. I am a mom. I have an almost three-year-old. Every mom in America, our heart goes out to these families who are mourning their loved ones, their innocent children, these minors who have lost their lives because of Joe Biden's wide open borders. These policies have had a humanitarian impact and it's been a crisis. It's inhumane these wide open borders, let alone the nearly 100,000 minors that have been lost by Joe Biden's Department of Homeland Security. This is a humanitarian crisis. It's a national security crisis, an economic crisis, and President Trump will secure the border. How do we know that? Because he did, and because he will do it again on day one.”

Date: 2024

Washington, D.C.--In case you missed it,Breitbartreported on Congresswoman Elise Stefanik leading bipartisan legislation to combat Joe Biden’s war on dairy,  introducing the Protecting Mothers and Infants' Access to Milk Act to override the Biden Administration rule which limits access to milk under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. As the representative of many dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country, Stefanik has actively advocated for Americans' access to nutritional dairy products.

Breitbart News: Elise Stefanik Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Unravel Part of Biden’s War on Milk

House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) introduced legislation on Wednesday to unravel part of President Joe Biden’s war on milk.

Stefanik unveiled the Protecting Mothers and Infants Access to Milk Act, a bipartisan bill to stop the Biden administration’s rule that limits women, babies, and families’ access to milk under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.

“I am proud to lead the bipartisan Protecting Mothers and Infants’ Access to Milk Act to counter Joe Biden’s restrictions on WIC families’ access to nutritional milk and dairy products,” Stefanik said in a written statement. “Families are already struggling with skyrocketing prices at the grocery store, and this new rule would limit their access to healthy milk our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country work hard to provide for our communities.”

Reps. Josh Harder (D-CA) and Derrick Van Order (R-WI) cosponsored Stefanik’s legislation.

In April, the Biden administration finalized the “Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Revisions in the WIC Food Packages,” which substantially reduced the amount of milk available to WIC families. Stefanik’s office contended that the rule could have harmful effects for women, babies, and families in the WIC program, as 90 percent of Americans do not meet their dairy consumption requirements, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Stefanik has led a bipartisan letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack about the rule, and in a letter with Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) demanded answers as to why the department did not follow a congressional directive not to reduce the maximum monthly allowance of milk in WIC.

This is not the only time the Agriculture Department has sought to limit Americans’ access to milk; Stefanik and House Republicans have fought a Biden move to limit children’s access to chocolate milk in schools across America.

Stefanik’s legislation is widely backed the organizations representing the dairy industry.

“The WIC program helps mothers and young children have access to key nutrients they otherwise may lack. Milk, cheese, and yogurt are three of the five top redeemed items through WIC. They also provide three of the four nutrients of public health concern identified in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. We commend Representatives Elise Stefanik, R-NY, Josh Harder, D-CA, and Derrick Van Orden, R-WI, for their Protecting Mothers and Infants’ Access to Milk Act to prevent any cuts to the dairy allotments in the WIC packages. This bill supports the program’s goal of ensuring all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, and affordable foods,” said Gregg Doud, President and CEO of National Milk Producers Federation.

“The Northeast Dairy Farmers Cooperatives, representing over 800 dairy farm families in New York and New England, who have a century-plus legacy of commitment to providing fresh, high-quality milk and award-winning dairy products, applaud Rep. Stefanik’s prodigious work on behalf of our producers and industry in authoring timely legislation to expand and increase the utilization of milk in the vital Women, Infants, Children (WIC) program,” said the Northeast Dairy Farmers Cooperatives.

Northeast Dairy Producers Association Chair Keith Kimball said, “Real dairy milk and other dairy foods are important sources of protein, vitamins and minerals that are proven to benefit people of all ages. With thirteen essential nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D, milk is a nutrient-dense beverage produced by family dairy farms across the Empire State. NEDPA fully supports consumer choice and efforts to ensure all New Yorkers have equitable access to nutritious dairy products.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions University Professors on Failure of University Leaders to Address the Rise of Antisemitism on Campuses
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, questioned Jewish professors from the University of California San Diego and Mt. San Antonio College on the failure of university leadership to keep Jewish students and community members safe and adequately address incidents of antisemitism on their campuses.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Professor Golden, thank you for being here today. You describe in your written testimony the antisemitic harassment that a professor and students have directed towards you and how it has caused you to want to leave academia. Could you describe the overall atmosphere that Jewish faculty and Jewish students are facing at your college, and specifically what was the college administration's response to those antisemitic incidents directed specifically to you?

Mt. San Antonio College Professor Dafna Golden:Thank you. The administration has chosen the path of least resistance doing the bare minimum to appear to take antisemitism seriously. They’ve refused to adopt the widely accepted IHRA definition of antisemitism which could help them better identify and address these incidents. While I commend them for not capitulating to divestment demands, their overall response has been mostly lip service.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Professor Keating, I understand that UCSD had its own antisemitic encampment on campus for five days before it was dispersed by the police. It is reported that 64 individuals were arrested, 40 of whom were students. Could you describe this encampment and the antisemitic statements made by protesters there?

University of California, San Diego Professor Brian Keating:Yes, thank you, Congresswoman. The encampment sprung up over a course of a period of five days. It tripled in size in just a few days. The protesters were allowed to have their freedom of speech, their First Amendment rights recognized. In fact, there have been 2,500 attendees to pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel protests on our campus alone, which have been majority peaceful. But this one was different. This one resulted in continued refusal to allow inspections by campus fire marshals. There were weapons found there, including a three foot long ninja sword that I displayed during my testimony. There were flammable materials found there. They would not let in inspectors. They would also not let in Jews or anybody identifying as a Jew wearing, for example, a Star of David or a Chai symbol, anything of that nature and it was incredibly intimidating. There were chants there globalizing the Intifada. There were leaflets passed out by the Revolutionary Socialists of America that said that freedom for Palestine means death to America as I displayed in my oral testimony as well. So this is an incredibly hostile environment not just for Jews, but for Americans and students who wanted to just have a peaceful day to go about their lives on campus and study or their employment.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I also want to ask you about policy changes that would address the rise of antisemitism on campuses across the country. Would banning the wearing of masks so that individuals at encampments can be identified help in this regard, and what other policy changes would help protect Jewish faculty and students?

Professor Brian Keating:I think so. I think banning masks is one step to doing so. I think it’s appropriate to wear religious garb of course but to completely cover your face, there’s absolutely no need to do that unless you’re involved in some activity that you’re either ashamed of or do not want to participate in, and so wearing masks and wearing full headgear and covering up your entire human personhood is demeaning and creates a barrier. Also, I should know that in the Students for Justice in Palestine constitution they adopt a strict policy of not negotiating with anyone who supports the State of Israel as a sovereign nation. They refused to negotiate or dialogue with “Zionists.” This organization currently is operating under a cease and desist order on campus. It didn’t prevent them from organizing a complicity walking tour where they targeted individual professors by name due to their national origin or at the fact that they were Jewish and doing research on studying say the biblical flood story. It had nothing to do with politics. It’s just because they happen to be Jewish and are conducting research in Israel. And the most reprehensible thing to me as a faculty member, it’s fine for students to exercise their rights, we all should do that. It’s part of our constitutionally granted rights. But for faculty to take a paycheck from a university that they claim is committing acts of genocide, is complicit in genocide, and to continue working there, and encourage students to get arrested and call students themselves complicit in the genocide themselves, and when students expressed their fear to the Academic Center Chair John Hildebrand, he ignored them, the Jewish students. And other people on an open call compared Jewish students fearing for their safety, he compared them to students during the segregation period who supported the KKK. This is unacceptable in a place of learning in my opinion.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Thank you for your bravery being here today. Thank you for standing up what is morally right, standing up for Jewish students, Jewish faculty, Jews around the world.

Title: Stefanik Leads Legislation to Ensure Access for WIC Families to Nutritional Dairy Products, Overriding Recent Biden Administration Rule
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, along with Congressman Josh Harder (D-CA) and Congressman Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) introducedlegislation, theProtecting Mothers and Infants' Access to Milk Actto return the maximum monthly allowance of milk available for families, utilizing the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to previous levels.

In April 2024, the Biden Administration finalized arule, “Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Revisions in the WIC Food Packages,” which substantially reduced the amount of milk available to WIC families. The final rule, which went into effect on June 17, 2024, will have unintended and significant negative effects on the health of babies, mothers, and families participating in WIC. According to theDietary Guidelines for Americans, about 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet dairy consumption recommendations.

“I am proud to lead the bipartisan Protecting Mothers and Infants' Access to Milk Actto counter Joe Biden’s restrictions on WIC families’ access to nutritional milk and dairy products,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Families are already struggling with skyrocketing prices at the grocery store, and this new rule would limit their access to healthy milk our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country work hard to provide for our communities.”

“While I was overseas defending our nation as a Navy SEAL, my wife was using WIC coupons to feed our children because a junior enlisted servicemember’s salary could not support a family. Milk provides 13 essential nutrients that are critical for a child’s growth and development, and for USDA to decrease the monthly allowance for milk is unprincipled. We must ensure women, infants, and children are fed and healthy, which is why I am proud to join Rep. Stefanik in introducing this legislation to restore the WIC maximum monthly allowances for milk, which should have never been cut in the first place,”said Congressman Derrick Van Orden (WI-03).

"The WIC program helps mothers and young children have access to key nutrients they otherwise may lack. Milk, cheese, and yogurt are three of the five top redeemed items through WIC. They also provide three of the four nutrients of public health concern identified in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Title: Stefanik Slams CIA Collusion with the Biden Campaign to Cover Up the Hunter Biden Laptop Story
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior Member of both the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, released the following statement regarding a report released by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House Judiciary Committee, and the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government:

“This damning report from House Republicans confirms what the American people have known for years,”said Congresswoman Stefanik.“Joe Biden and his campaign colluded with the 51 disgraced former intelligence officials and weaponized the highest levels of the CIA, including signatories of the statement that were actively in a contractual relationship with the CIA, to cover up the Hunter Biden laptop story. House Republicans will continue to expose this blatant weaponization of the federal government and hold both Joe Biden and his administration accountable through our constitutionally mandated role of oversight.”

Background:

On October 14, 2020, theNew York Postpublished a report detailing how Hunter Biden used the position and influence of his father, now-President Joe Biden, for personal gain with the apparent awareness of President Biden. Five days later, on October 19, 2020, 51 former intelligence officials signed on to a public statement that stated that the Hunter Biden laptop story had "all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation," in an attempt to discredit the New York Post’s reporting.

Since April 2022—and renewed in January 2023, when Republicans resumed control of the House of Representatives—the Committees have been conducting oversight into the origins of this statement. The Committees wrote to all 51 former officials requesting relevant documents and testimony.

The Committees'first joint interim staff reportrevealed how the now-infamous and discredited Hunter Biden statement originated with a call from top Biden campaign official—and now Secretary of State—Antony Blinken to former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell to provide talking points and cover for the Biden campaign to discredit serious allegations about the Biden family’s influence peddling. Morell's testimony also exposed that the goal of the statement was to aid President Biden in the final debate of the 2020 presidential campaign.

New Information:

The highest officials within the CIA were aware of the statement prior to its publication. CIA’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Andrew Makridis testified that he informed Director Gina Haspel or Deputy Director Vaughn Frederick Bishop about its impending release. This sequence of events suggests that senior CIA leadership had ample opportunity to assess the validity of the statement's claims. Furthermore, the COO’s office appeared to signal approval of the statement in a move that departed from standard Prepublication Classification Review Board (PCRB) protocols.

Additionally, some of the statement's signatories were on active contract with the CIA at the time they issued the statement to discredit damaging allegations about Biden family influence peddling. Despite claiming they lacked access to classified information at the time, at least two signatories—Michael Morell and former CIA Inspector General David Buckley—were actively working for the CIA as contractors. This revelation raises concerns that these officials may have abused their positions to expedite the statement's approval and may have been earning taxpayer dollars while they did it.

Furthermore, officials within the CIA recognized at the time that the Hunter Biden statement was political and would hurt the Agency. The signatories' decision to leverage their former intelligence community titles to promote a narrative about foreign election interference improperly embroiled the Agency in domestic politics. This report underscores the potential dangers of a politicized intelligence community.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Blasts Joe Biden’s Failed Far Left Democrat Open Border Policies
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —In case you missed it, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how Joe Biden’s failedFar Left open border policies are jeopardizing the safety and security of every American. Stefanik emphasized how House Republicans will deliver where Joe Biden has failed. We must secure the wide open borders by returning to the successful border security policies of President Trump.

Watch her full remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below:

“The American people are experiencing the most wide open, catastrophic border crisis in our nation’s history because of Joe Biden’s failed leadership. Just last week, the May border numbers were released proving that Biden’s executive order further incentivized illegal immigration. May was the 39th straight month where monthly illegal immigrant encounters were higher than even the highest month under President Trump.

Joe Biden’s open border policies continue to devastate American communities. Just last week, we saw the horrific news that the beautiful, innocent, twelve-year-old girl, Jocelyn Nungaray, was brutally murdered and assaulted by criminals here illegally, criminals who were encountered by Border Patrol, but due to the failures of catch-and-release, were released to commit this heinous crime. Justice must be served, and they must be immediately deported. This needless human tragedy is the most recent loss from this humanitarian crisis devastating American communities and families. Since Joe Biden took office and implemented his failed Far Left Democrat open border agenda, 10 million illegal immigrants have invaded our country. Just last night, we heard that Joe Biden had released over 400 illegals with ties to ISIS into our country and that over 50 of them are still roaming free. This is a national security risk and a direct result of Joe Biden’s failed Far Left Democrat open border policies.

In my district in Upstate New York and the North Country, the Northern Border has seen record illegal crossings including individuals on the terrorist watchlist. The American people know what a secure border looks like. Under President Trump, we saw the most secure border in modern history: building the wall, ending catch-and-release, and implementing Remain in Mexico.

This week, House Republicans will deliver where Joe Biden has failed, using our appropriations bills to return to the successful border security policies of President Trump.

I also wanted to note yesterday House Republicans released a report exposing Joe Biden and his campaign’s illegal and unconstitutional collusion with 51 disgraced former intelligence officials including signatories of the statement that were actively contracted with the CIA, and the weaponization was at the highest levels of the CIA to cover up the Hunter Biden laptop story. House Republicans will continue to expose this blatant and illegal weaponization of the federal government and hold both Joe Biden and his Administration accountable through our constitutionally mandated role of oversight.

Tomorrow, all eyes will be on Georgia where the American people will hear directly from President Trump and as well as President Joe Biden in the first debate. It will be clear to the American people that President Trump’s America First agenda delivered the securest border in our nation’s history, a booming economy–helping families, small businesses, manufactures, and farms–American energy independence, and peace through strength. Compare that to today: Joe Biden’s feckless, failed, and catastrophically weak record.

With that, we’re honored to be joined by Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, Mark Amodei, to discuss how House Republicans are returning to strong border security policies through the appropriations process.”

Date: 2024

Watch the Faith and Freedom Coalition video on Chairwoman Stefanik’s workhere, and see below for her remarks to the conference.

Watch her full speechhere.

Full speech transcript below:

Thank you so much, Ralph. It is truly a humbling honor to be here today. But let's get this energy up. Are we ready in 136 days to fire Joe Biden and Save America

Are we ready to reelect my good friend and your good friend, President Donald J. Trump? Yes, we are.

Again, it is truly an honor to be here today and I want to first start by saying thank you, thank you to each and every one of you for your grassroots efforts every day from all you do across the country at the local, regional, state and national level.

This is the most important election in our lifetime. We know that this election is different, that the stake of our nation, the protection of our Constitution, are on the ballot this November. We have to leave everything on the field to save our great nation and save the American Dream. And President Trump is the only one who will be able to get that done.

I also want to thank Ralph for his extraordinary leadership. He has been a leader in the conservative movement from a very young age, he is a wonderful friend as is his family to mine. I've gotten to know him on the campaign trail, particularly as we've worked to support President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot. So to earn this award and be presented by Ralph, such an esteemed conservative leader, it's truly a humbling honor for me.

Let's talk about what's at stake this election cycle we have seen under Joe Biden crisis after crisis. Let's start with the historic Biden Border Catastrophe. This is the most wide open catastrophic border crisis in our nation's history. And let me tell you, it's not just our Southern Border. I know we have so many Southern Border states who are here represented today, but it is our border across the country and our Northern Border. I was just up in my district in Upstate New York meeting with Border Patrol and we've seen more illegals crossing than ever before, including individuals on the terrorist watch list. And the American people are smart. They know that the millions of illegals that have poured into our country are because of Joe Biden's unconstitutional, illegal executive actions, wiping away President Trump's most effective border security policies in our nation's history. That's why when President Trump says he will secure the border, build the wall, end catch and release, restore Remain in Mexico policy. We know what the most secure border is in our nation's history and it’s President Trump's border security policies. Those are on the ballot this November.

And it's not just border states, as I mentioned, whether your Northern Border states or Southern Border states, every district every state is a border state and border district. Every community is a border district, the leading cause of death for young Americans is fentanyl poisoning, which is flowing in across our borders because of this border catastrophe. We're going to run and we're going to win on securing the border.

On top of the border crisis, we also have the Bidenflation Crisis, the highest rate of inflation in my lifetime. If you talk to hardworking Americans, which I do every day, I was just in my district, visiting small businesses, visiting with members of the workforce, visiting with hardworking families. This inflation is crushing hardworking families going to the grocery store every week the price of eggs, I'm a new mom the price of diapers, the price of baby formula, the price of food, bacon, meat, it goes up and up and it's a direct result of Joe Biden's failed Biden economics policies which have hurt catastrophically families, small businesses, manufacturers and farms. Compare that with the America First economic boom that we saw under President Trump.

We're going to restore American greatness. We're going to restore the great America First economy, and we will get that done. House Republicans working with President Trump to fight back and crush this inflation that has been hurting so many families.

And we also, and this is tied to the economic crisis we're seeing, the inflation crisis under Joe Biden, the Energy Crisis. On day one, Joe Biden declared war on American energy independence and hardworking Americans are footing the bill. We're paying more for utilities. Paying more at the pump. All of those energy costs continue to go up. We're having to rely on unAmerican energy. We must be the energy leader in the world. We know that under President Trump on day one, we will unleash American energy independence, the hundreds of thousands of jobs that come from that, the billions of economic growth that come from those policies, we will get that done.

We also have a catastrophic Crime Crisis. And I can speak to that from a traditionally blue state like New York, where we have seen Democrats that control all levers of government, advocate for defunding the police, for failed bail reform which allows violent criminals to return back to our streets. We have a crime crisis in places like San Francisco, New York City, other places across America. But what the American people are seeing through, is at the same time as this catastrophic crime crisis, we're seeing the illegal weaponization of our courts and radical district attorneys like Alvin Bragg going after Joe Biden's chief political opponent, that is Donald J. Trump. It is a form of election interference. It is illegal, it is unconstitutional.

We must do everything we can as the American people to make sure that we restore equal justice under the law, that we stand up against this radicalization, this corruption of our courts. I've been proud, as a member of the New York delegation and just a proud New Yorker, to file ethics complaints against Alvin Bragg, the corrupt process, the jury selection process.

Think about this. It is so corrupt that in the jury selection process the jurors were asked, do you follow any social media accounts of President Donald J. Trump? If any of them said yes, they were not allowed to serve on the jury. They were not asked that about Joe Biden. They jury shopped and then they illegally judge shopped. The fact that this is a judge that donated to Joe Biden, it is corrupt, corrupt to the core. And on top of that, the judge's direct family members are some of the chief fundraisers for radical Democrats like Adam Schiff, fundraising off of this illegal lawfare court case going after President Donald J. Trump. We must save our country at the ballot box this November. It will be the American people that save the Constitution and save this country and fight back.

And I will tell you this is part of the reason why recently you've seen President Trump gaining in poll after poll. He is ahead in every swing state. But importantly, even states like New York, Democrats are in big, big trouble. President Trump is within single digits in New York State and we are proud as New Yorkers that no state flipped more House congressional seats than New York state from Democrat to Republican. We will continue to go on offense to build this majority and send Democrats packing.

On top of the Biden Border Crisis, the Inflation Crisis, the Energy Crisis, the Crime Crisis, we've also seen Joe Biden's weakness as Commander in Chief on the global stage. We saw the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, an absolute absolute black mark on America, the way the rest of the world views America. We then saw Israel, our most precious ally, under attack from the vicious Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, leading to the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And what have we seen from Joe Biden? What have we seen from this White House? We have seen anti-Israel policies, they have turned their back on our most precious ally. And I am very proud that President Trump - if you look at our greatest defender of Israel from the White House, it was President Trump. The Abraham Accords, the embassy to Jerusalem, support for Israel, the Iron Dome support.

And I recently had the opportunity to deliver remarks in the Jerusalem Room at the Knesset, and I'm very proud, over my lifetime, even before I was in Congress. I am proud to be a lifetime supporter of Israel. And I know you are as well, and America is as well.

I had the opportunity to travel to Israel when I was an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to travel when I was a young professional, and I have been there many times as a member of Congress. And it is more important than ever that the United States, that America, shows moral leadership, and standing with Israel. There should be no equivocation, no daylight when it comes to US support for Israel.

And unfortunately, in the aftermath of that bloodiest day since the Holocaust, we saw our “most elite” universities fail. It was not just moral equivocation, it was moral bankruptcy that we saw on full display. Now I want to ask you, did you see that committee hearing clip?

Yes.

The world saw that committee hearing clip and I want to take you into that committee hearing. I was deeply concerned with the rise of antisemitism, particularly after the October 7th Hamas attack against Israel. I graduated from Harvard myself, I'm the first member of my immediate family to have that opportunity to graduate from college. But I'm what I'm most proud of is I graduated and stayed a conservative, which is a big achievement.

So I encouraged my colleague, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, that we needed to have a hearing to address and combat this rise of antisemitism on our college campuses. And she agreed. We had the hearing with university presidents from MIT, from Penn and from Harvard, and throughout the hearing, we did not get a lot of direct answers. They were trying to avoid answering our questions. The question that is now the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress, that was the last question of the committee hearing. It was not my prepared question. I thought, how can I ask this question in a moral way to force a yes answer. And that question was this: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university's code of conduct?” And one after the other after the other said, “it depends on the context,” and the world heard. We know it does not depend on the context. We know that that is not reflective of American values. UPenn's president was forced to resign within 48 hours, it took a month Harvard president was forced to resign as well.

And we have a message for Higher Ed. Two down, so many to go, we will continue!

We will continue to stand up for what's right, we will continue to hold these universities accountable. Each of those higher ed institution relies on nearly $1 billion of US taxpayer funds every year. If there is any support for antisemitism, if these schools refuse and fail to protect Jewish students, we will defund them. We will stand up for US taxpayer dollars and we will hold them accountable.

And it's not just looking at US taxpayer dollars. We are very focused on the foreign funding piece. If you look at the amount of foreign funding from adversaries that are flowing into our higher ed institutions, it made news just this week. Those universities are not disclosing according to the law, how much money they're receiving from these foreign countries. That needs to be fully transparent for the American people. These are American institutions.

So those three universities, MIT, Penn and Harvard, we've since had the Columbia University president who failed in that testimony. Her presidency is untenable as she chose to negotiate with the pro-Hamas encampment as they refuse to enforce the rules, as they fail to protect Jewish students. We will continue to, using our subpoena power, to bringing them under oath in front of these committees until we root out this rot of antisemitism to its core.

So again, I am just so grateful to have had the opportunity to speak with you today. I'm very proud to serve as House Republican Conference Chair. My goal every single day is to make sure House Republicans are unified, that we are focusing on the issues that matter to the American people, that we are going on offense communicating our positive message of making America great again and the America First movement. And we are crisscrossing this country to not only flip the Senate, but to gain seats in the House, and most importantly, to elect PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP. Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. Thank you to the Faith and Freedom Coalition for this award.

Title: ICYMI: Press-Republican: New Medisca facility opens in Plattsburgh
Date: 2024

Content:
Plattsburgh, N.Y.– In case you missed it,Press-Republicanreported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and local elected officials joined pharmaceutical company Medisca for the ribbon-cutting ceremony of their new headquarters in Plattsburgh.

Read the full article below:

PLATTSBURGH — Medisca’s new 60,000 square-foot pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution facility in the Town of Plattsburgh is the “largest project” the company has undertaken in its 35-year history.

“Ultimately, the new facility will more than double our repacking and distribution capabilities for the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and the emerging markets,” Tony Dos Santos, who founded Medisca with Maria Zaccardo, said at the facility’s grand opening ceremony Thursday.

“We’re presently shipping to 40 emerging markets across the world. The increased capacity will allow us to support the growth of the diverse healthcare groups we service. We service 503A pharmacies, 503B pharmacies, outsourcing facilities, hospitals, clinics, research institutions, CMOs (contract manufacturing organization), wholesalers and more.”

Medisca, a global company offering pharmaceutical compounding products and services, mixing technology, manufacturing, education services and more, will employ up to 85 professionals ranging from high-skilled to entry-level positions at its new facility located at 626 Tom Miller Road in the Town of Plattsburgh.

MEETING DEMANDS

Dos Santos said the facility will have upgrades and improvements that will allow the company to better serve the growing demands of the business.

“We now have the capability to repackage cytotoxic drugs, leveraging custom-built isolators, we have state-of-the-art electronic weighing and monitoring systems,” he said.

“Our facility also reinforces our adherence to a rigorous quality system. Our innovative isolators reduce product cross contamination and protect the integrity of the product. Our monitoring systems allow for immediate response to any deviations and our warehouse management system ensures A to Z traceability in seconds. Prioritizing the health, safety and wellness of Medisca personnel was also the forefront of every decision made in the design of our facility.”

Medisca first came to Plattsburgh in 1992, just three years after opening its doors in Montreal.

Dos Santos said the plans to expand Medisca’s operations initially began 10 years ago.

The company’s commitment to staying in and making Plattsburgh the home of its new American headquarters came to fruition through a lease agreement with TDC NNY Premier Industrial Parks in late 2022, just months after construction on the building began.

“Finding the right location was critical,” Dos Santos said. “We found the right location with the help of TDC.”

KEY CONTRIBUTION TO SUCCESS

Medisca CEO Sanjay D. Goorachurn called the new facility an “incredible achievement.”

“For a company that started 35 years ago, to actually attain the kind of success that it has now, and we’re hoping to build more on that,” he said.

“Practically speaking, this U.S. facility is a key contribution to Medisca’s success, not just in the U.S. but across the world. So this is very important for us.”

NY-21 Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) was in attendance for the grand opening and said Medisca’s expansion is “a true testament to the economic strength of our region.”

“I’m so proud to have the opportunity and really the humble honor of representing so many incredible entrepreneurial small businesses and manufacturers that call the North Country home,” she continued.

“This is very exciting. As I spoke with Tony and Maria and other members of the Medisca team, the fact that there was such a significant expansion for a global company right here in the Town of Plattsburgh, that is a big testament to our region.”

LEGISLATORS HAIL MOVE

State Sen. Dan Stec (R-Queensbury) said Medisca is bringing jobs and economic opportunity.

“That’s what we all want,” Stec said.

“We all want an opportunity to raise our own families in a healthy environment that has everything in it that we want and that comes with making sure that you have … both a team here locally with Medisca, and the North Country Chamber of Commerce always driving the ball trying to make sure that they’re opening as many doors as they can, (and) leveraging our greatest asset: our people.”

Assemblyman Billy Jones (D-Chateauguay Lake) thanked Medisca for investing in both the North Country and Plattsburgh.

“You planted that seed many, many years ago and it’s not easy ... but you have done this,” Jones said.

“You have provided job opportunities for our people here, you have created an atmosphere where you can celebrate great, great things that you have done. We talked about the cross-border relationship that is going on, and this is an example of it.”

‘CLINTON COUNTY IS A STANDOUT’

After the remarks concluded, a ribbon cutting for the facility took place out front. Local and state officials and media were then given a tour of the facility by Medisca operations manager Larry Harney.

Following the tour, Stefanik said Clinton County does an exceptional job at highlighting economic development and manufacturing opportunities.

“Clinton County is a standout when it comes to understanding the importance of the U.S.-Canadian relationship in terms of Canadian companies that open up important facilities here for that cross-border manufacturing and cross-border supply chain,” she said.

“This is also a testament to TDC, the North Country Chamber of Commerce, so many entities in this region, as well as our workforce development programs here that we have. You see a very dedicated workforce right here, and people that have worked here for over decades, and we’re very proud of that, and we’ll continue doing everything we can to support local economic development to work with our county legislature, our state elected officials, and the North Country Chamber of Commerce and businesses here.”

Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congresswoman Claudia Tenney sent aletterto Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin expressing their full support for the City of Watertown’s Defense Community Infrastructure Project grant application. The City of Watertown recently submitted an application to the Department of Defense (DoD) for a $17 million grant to help support Watertown’s water treatment plant improvement project.

Watertown’s water treatment plant provides Fort Drum with a large portion of its drinking water so it is eligible to receive DoD grant funding for this project. The improvement project is necessary to ensure the water treatment plant is in compliance with drinking water quality standards.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The City of Watertown’s WTP plays a critical role in providing potable water to Fort Drum, a cornerstone of our nation's defense infrastructure and a power projection platform for the United States Army. The proposed water quality improvement project will enhance the resiliency of Fort Drum, fortify its water supply, and improve the quality of life for military families and the surrounding communities.”

The lawmakers continue,“The City of Watertown’s WTP improvement project aligns directly with DCIP’s mission to “address deficiencies in community infrastructure, supportive of a military installation, in order to enhance military value, cadet training at covered educational institutions, installation resilience, and military family quality of life.” Additionally, water access is classified as defense-related critical infrastructure by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency which increases the priority of this project. Finally, this project is widely supported by Fort Drum and is construction ready. The City of Watertown’s WTP improvement project is fully qualified and deserving of this DCIP funding.”

"On behalf of the City of Watertown, I would like to express my gratitude to Congresswoman Stefanik and Congresswoman Tenney for their unwavering support of the City's efforts to secure crucial federal funding for our water treatment project,"said Watertown City Mayor Sarah Pierce."Their dedication to our community's health and well-being is truly commendable and I am appreciative of their partnership as we work to make this vital improvement a reality."

“Tomorrow, House Republicans are honored to host at our special political conference President Donald J. Trump where we will discuss how Republicans will work together to save America from Joe Biden and Far Left Democrats' failed leadership that has caused skyrocketing and painful Bidenflation, the historic Biden Border Crisis, surging violent crime, a weakened national security, and chaos around the world.

This week on the Floor, House Republicans are delivering on our promise to hold the Biden Administration accountable when we bring to the Floor our resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with our subpoena and release the audio recordings of Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. It's time for Merrick Garland to stop stonewalling and release the Biden tapes.

Additionally, we will bring to the Floor the national defense bill for FY25, and as a Senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I’m proud to have helped craft this legislation securing critical wins for my home district, for Fort Drum, the 10th Mountain Division, and all of Upstate New York. This bill also includes significant investments in emerging technology, provides for our military families, equips our service members with modern capabilities and platforms as they fight to protect our Nation and deter our adversaries.

I also quickly want to touch upon yesterday’s deposition of corrupt former, disgraced New York Governor Andrew Cuomo whose fatal nursing home order resulted in the deaths of over 15 thousand innocent seniors dying in nursing homes. This was a long overdue step for those families who are still mourning the loss of their loved ones in New York state. We will continue to fight to deliver justice and accountability and answers for those families who are still grieving.”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik Joins New York Republicans Demanding Accountability Following Deposition of Corrupt Former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo
Date: 2024

Content:
Watch her remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below:

“This day has been a long time coming. Each of our offices have heard from constituents who have lost loved ones resulting from Andrew Cuomo‘s fatal directive issued on March 25, regarding our nursing homes, forcing nursing homes to take positive COVID patients. So today’s deposition was a step in delivering accountability and delivering long overdue answers to those families who are still mourning the loss of their loved ones. A few highlights from the deposition today: The deposition began with Governor, former Governor, Cuomo‘s lawyer adamant that I could not ask questions since I’m not a member of the Committee. What we informed her and I informed her was that I was going to ask questions as Chair of the House Republican Conference waving onto the Committee and like other New Yorkers, ask questions on behalf of my constituents. The former Governor called Democratic staff members conspiracy theorists, bizarre, obsessive when it came to Democrat staff’s questions regarding Cuomo‘s team cooking the books when it came to testing numbers. In addition, under my questioning, former Governor Cuomo admitted that the New York directive language on March 25 was not the same language as CMS guidance despite his public attempt to point fingers and blame CMS to try to blame President Trump. In the deposition, he admitted that the language in the March 25 directive was not the language in CMS. In addition, he smeared Tish James’ report as overly political. He smeared Kathy Hochul who was serving as his Lieutenant Governor at the time. When asked about his staff’s inappropriate behavior and smearing of nursing home families who lost loved ones, he did finally admit that that was unkind and not appropriate. He also went so far as to say that his senior staff, when they suggested other members to lie on depositions, he made it a point to say, ‘Suggesting to lie is not perjury,’ so he is complicit to obstructing justice. At the end after hours and hours and hours, I asked him, ‘Does he apologize to these families?’ And finally, he said that he already has, and I said, ‘Does he have accountability?’ And despite hours and hours of trying to blame everybody else in the final moments of the deposition, he said, ‘Ultimately as the New York Governor, there is accountability for how they handled nursing homes.’ This is an important step. We’re going to continue doing the important work of this Select Committee.”

Title: Stefanik Calls for Increased Transparency, Detailed Timeline from Amtrak and CN After Extended Suspension of the Adirondack Line
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto Amtrak President Roger Harris and Canadian National Railway (CN) President and CEO Tracy Robinson expressing deep concern regarding the extended suspension of service of the Amtrak Adirondack Line between Saratoga Springs and Montreal. Stefanik demanded Amtrak and CN provide greater transparency into the rationale behind continued delays of service that our Upstate New York and North Country communities as well as our Canadian neighbors and tourists rely on as a vital source of transportation.

Stefanik also requested Amtrak and CN outline a concrete timeline of the resumption of service of the Adirondack Line in order to provide our communities the certainty of service they deserve. The current suspension of service of the Adirondack Line between Saratoga Springs and Montreal hampers tourism and economic development in our region during popular summer months.

In the letter, Stefanik states,“Over the past year, I have continuously called for Amtrak and CN to come to an agreement and my office has been engaged ceaselessly in advocating to keep the Adirondack Line fully functional. On May 17, 2024, both Amtrak and CN finally announced they reached an agreement to make the track improvements needed to prevent any future summer stoppages of service of the Amtrak Adirondack Line, stating ‘Amtrak and CN Railway are pleased to have resolved the service issues associated with the Adirondack Line between Rouses Point, New York and Montreal’s Central Station. In an agreement signed today, Amtrak will make a payment to CN and CN has agreed to use the settlement payment to undertake track work on its Rouses Point Subdivision for Amtrak’s benefit.’”

Stefanik continues,“While the announcement of an agreement between Amtrak and CN was welcome news, it was short-lived. Initially, Amtrak stated ‘Due to anticipated track work, Amtrak has modified Adirondack service on a short-term basis from May 20 to June 30 and will only operate between New York City and Saratoga Springs.’ However, a few short weeks after the announcement of the agreement, the stoppage of service of the Adirondack Line was extended through Sunday, September 8, 2024. The continued delays in service and lack of transparency from Amtrak and CN for our Upstate New York and North Country communities is completely unacceptable.”

“It's like Charlie Brown with Lucy pulling away the football over and over, only instead of a cartoon it's real,”says Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce.“The service is shut down for three years during and well after the pandemic but no work is done to address conditions. Then they restart in April 2023 only to just discover a heat related rail issue a few months later, halting the train for the summer. Then they wait until almost summer 2024 to reach a repair agreement that they now find will take three months instead of the announced six weeks to carry out. Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Schumer have been steadfast on this and hopefully can obtain some needed accountability.”

“ESPA appreciates Congresswoman Stefanik’s tenacity in continuing to press both Canadian National and Amtrak for more transparency on this matter. We cannot allow a dispute involving less than 40 miles of track to continue disrupting international travel and access to and from the North Country,”said Steve Strauss, Executive Director of the Empire State Passengers Association.

In September 2023, Congresswoman Stefaniksentaletterdemanding that Amtrak and CN provide a plan of action to avoid a future summer stoppage of service of the Adirondack Line.

In May 2024, Congresswoman Stefanikannouncedthat following her advocacy, Amtrak and CN reached an agreement to make the track improvements needed to prevent any future summer stoppages of service of Amtrak’s Adirondack Line.

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik Joins Life, Liberty & Levin To Discuss the Political Witchhunt Against President Trump, Joe Biden’s Border Crisis & House Republicans Standing Strong with Israel
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’Life, Liberty & Levinto discuss combatting Joe Biden’s catastrophic border crisis, the Biden Administration’s refusal to stand with our most precious ally, Israel, and the multiple actions she has taken to combat the illegal weaponization of the American justice system by Far Left Democrats against President Donald Trump.

Stefanik also emphasized her recent visit to Israel at the request of the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset, Speaker Ohana, to discuss her work standing with Israel, both at home and abroad.

Watch her remarks here.

View highlights from her interview below:

On House Republicans' Commitment to Secure The Border:

“Joe Biden has created the most catastrophic border crisis in our nation's history, and the American people know it. That's why if you look at the polling, Mark, President Trump is polling over 30 points ahead when it comes to handling of border security and illegal immigration. House Republicans passed the Secure the Border Act a year ago. Joe Biden refused to support that bill, in fact threatened to veto that bill, and Chuck Schumer killed that bill. So it's House Republicans who have led legislatively to secure the border. It was Joe Biden who months ago said he didn't have the executive authority to fix this border crisis even though the American people know that it was his executive actions that created this border crisis. So this latest, desperate executive order that Joe Biden has put out, it is political desperation, and it only further fuels the illegals who are able to cross both our Southern and Northern Borders.”

On Joe Biden’s Executive Order Political Stunt Which Does Nothing For Border Security:

“It would have further fueled the fire, and it would have opened up the floodgates for more illegal immigrants to pour into this country. It would not have ended ‘catch-and-release.’ It would not have reinstated the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. We know what a secure border looks like; It looks like President Trump's effective border security policies when we had the most secure border in my lifetime. That's why House Republicans opposed this pro-amnesty negotiated behind closed doors that Joe Biden politically wanted to bail him out to cover up for this border crisis that he has created. And I will tell you, Mark, I've gone to the border both the Southern and Northern border firsthand. I represent the Swanton Sector of the Northern Border. We have seen illegal crossings skyrocket under Joe Biden's failed leadership including those on the terror watchlist. This is a national security crisis, an economic crisis, and it is a constitutional crisis because if you don't have borders, you lose your sovereignty as a nation. So this is an issue House Republicans are going to win on. And when we elect President Trump, continue to grow the House Republican majority, and flip the Senate, we will make sure that in addition to President Trump's executive orders, that we get Secure the Border Act signed into law.”

On The Impact of the Biden Border Crisis And The Need To Return to President Trump’s Strong Border Policies :

“It gets worse even than what you laid out, Mark, think about it: Joe Biden's Department of Homeland Security does not know, has lost track of nearly 100,000 minors who are in sex slavery, who are being human trafficked. It is a humanitarian travesty, and it's all on Joe Biden's watch. He has created this border crisis lock, stock, and barrel, and the American people are going to hold him accountable. You're exactly right that President Trump's executive orders created the most secure border both on the Northern and Southern Border in our nation's history. That's why the bill that House Republicans passed with strong support, despite our very slim majority, we passed the Secure the Border Act to enshrine those Trump executive orders. And the Democrats can't have it both ways. They say first, ‘Joe Biden doesn't have the executive authority,’ and then they put out a desperate executive order. It is offensive to the American people and voters because they know that Joe Biden's executive actions on day one opened up the border. It has allowed ‘catch-and-release,’ and has created this crisis of transferring of illegals to places all across the country. So it's not just the border states and communities that are impacted, it's every state is a border state. Every community is a border community, and it is in crisis because of Joe Biden. And President Trump is going to secure the border with the help of House Republicans and Senate Republicans.”

On Joe Biden’s Failure To Stand Strong With Israel:

“Well, it is antisemitism that is a growing strain in today's Democrat Party that has now become mainstream, and it is anti-Israel. At every opportunity, Joe Biden has equivocated morally and turned his back on Israel. I was honored to be invited by the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset, Speaker Ohana, to deliver remarks about the importance of the United States standing with Israel. This was the same week that Joe Biden attempted and is still withholding military aid that Congress passed in support of our most precious ally in the Middle East. You have an Administration that's Obama 2.0 prioritizing Iran and undermining Israel, and it's created chaos and national security threats around the world because of Joe Biden's weakness on the world stage.”

…

“Well, what I make of it is this is a continuation of the Obama Administration, including some of the same individuals who are at the table in terms of these discussions, whether it's working through European countries to pave the way for Iranian nuclear weapons capability. Remember, Mark, this is the same Administration and the same State Department that put out an official statement mourning the loss of the Iranian President. Let me tell you what the Iranian people who have been abused by the Iranian President and the regime, they did not mourn the loss of this President. And, yet, this is the same Administration who is turning their back on Israel. So it's Obama 2.0. It is failure. Compare that to the historic achievements in the Middle East of President Trump, whether it's the Abraham Accords, whether it's the recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal capital and moving our US Embassy there, and we had peace in the Middle East under President Trump, and voters know that going to the polls this November.”

On Combating the Illegal Weaponization of the Justice System Against President Trump:

“I did. I filed multiple ethics complaints. This is shredding our democracy. The mainstream media and Democrats accused the Right, but it's really Democrats who are attacking our democracy. When you take the judge in the New York case, this was a zombie case taken up by Alvin Bragg, a corrupt, radical Democrat prosecutor who is releasing violent criminals on the streets which is why we have a crime crisis in New York. And you have a judge who donated to Joe Biden and whose family members are profiting to the tunes of tens of millions of dollars, raising money for Democrats like Adam Schiff and Joe Biden because of this trial. So this is a political witch hunt. They jury shopped as well, asking jury members whether they followed Donald Trump on social media. They didn't ask if they followed Joe Biden. And the American people know that this was rigged from the start, and it is an affront to us. President Trump is correct that the real verdict will be rendered this November on Election Day when President Trump wins overwhelmingly. And I also think in New York, the fact that President Trump is within six points, a traditionally blue state, means that momentum is moving in our direction because people see this for what it is: If they can go after President Trump and political opponents, they can go after any American.”

Washington, D.C. -House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on Israel rescuing four hostages.

"This morning brought incredible news that four Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and kept in captivity in Gaza were rescued by Israeli forces. The news of the return of Noa Argamani, Andrey Kozlov, Almog Meir, and Shlomi Ziv is welcomed and celebrated in the United States and around the world.

During my recent delegation to Israel, I had the opportunity to meet with Shlomi Ziv’s brave mother and strong sister to hear about their tremendous loss and heartbreak since Shlomi was taken hostage and their determination to continue to believe and work to bring him home. I was incredibly moved by their love of their beloved son and brother.

God Bless these families, many of whom I have met with. And while today is incredible news, I am praying for all the families who are still waiting for their loved ones to come home.

I will continue to do all that I can to support Israel to bring ALL the hostages home."

The Federalist:Republicans’ Defense Amendment Would Rescue Military Kids From Lefty Indoctrination In DOD Schools

By Max Eden and Amy Haywood

Among the many national security liabilities created by the Biden administration, one of the less remarked upon has been the ideological corruption of the schools serving children of America’s military servicemembers.

The outgoing director of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) schools hired a woman with a very public record of anti-white racism as its first chief of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI). DODEA, which runs 160 schools on military bases across the globe serving more than 69,000 children of military personnel, has gone further than perhaps any district in America in systematizing secret so-called gender transitions. In Bahrain, the official school Facebook account openly celebrated a pro-Hamas political activist.

Telling America’s military servicemembers that “in exchange for risking your lives to serve our country, we’ll teach your children to hate your values” is a dishonorable deal for Uncle Sam to offer. Fortunately, Republicans in Congress have taken note — and are stepping up to change the way DODEA schools are governed.

After revelations published by the Claremont Institute and Open the Books regarding the extremely ideological “equity training” offered to teachers — which included recommending so-called Social and Emotional Learning material intended to make children cry — congressional Republicans, led by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., added a Servicemember Parents Bill of Rights to the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Given the stir around these trainings — and the apparently corrupt dealings of DODEA’s anti-white chief diversity officer — DODEA eliminated the position of chief diversity officer and appeared to disband its DEI department.

But that was a sham. As Open the Books, a transparency oversight nonprofit organization, noted, DODEA school chief Tom Brady opted instead to form a secretive “DEI Steering Committee.” DODEA has stonewalled public records requests from Open the Books regarding the membership and activities of this committee and also blocked congressional inquiry led by Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind.

Banks sponsored an amendment to the most recent NDAA for fiscal 2025, passed out of committee last Wednesday, to dismantle the DODEA DEI Steering Committee. Perhaps more importantly, he sponsored an amendment to create a small school choice pilot program for 30 students in the DODEA school in Bahrain, which has experienced not only significant problems with facilities but also apparently supported an antisemitic activist who openly embraces the cause of Hamas.

Congressional Democrats vehemently and unanimously opposed Banks’ amendments. And it’s no wonder why. The last round of NDAA extended additional rights to service members whose children attend DODEA schools. Banks’ amendments represent a potential for a significant shift in the exercise of congressional authority over DODEA. His amendment would actually dictate aspects of how DODEA is managed. And, more importantly, his amendment could create a precedent for extending school choice to the children of all military service members. The NDAA now awaits a full House vote; after passage, it must be reconciled with the Senate’s forthcoming version of the bill before it can be sent to the president to sign into law.

About two decades ago, congressional Republicans — especially Rep. John Boehner — noted the disaster that was the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) system and decided to launch a voucher program for D.C. children. Congress has even more authority over DODEA than over DCPS. Historically, Congress has not exercised it — partly because offering choice to DODEA parents would seem to be an admission that the schools were not excellent. Given the generally high standardized test scores these students achieve, Congress likely made a prudential calculation that it was in America’s national security interest to let this system operate as is.

But now the Biden administration and the leadership of outgoing DODEA Director Brady have infected operations with DEI, and the public recognizes that direct federal influence and control has fully institutionalized this anti-American ideology, it only makes strategic sense for Congress to change its calculation. Banks’ program for now may be only a pilot serving 30 students. But hopefully, if and when Republicans gain full legislative control, they can follow in the footsteps of state legislators across the country and extend universal education savings accounts to all families serving our country.

Just as school choice for students in the District of Columbia has been a steadfast Republican congressional priority, so too should it be for children of America’s military service members.

Title: Stefanik Statement on the DC Circuit's Corruption and Illegal Leaks
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. --Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement:

“If the media had contacted my office before publishing a misleading, false, and inaccurate story, they could have spared their readers from misinformation being spread by the desperately corrupt DC Circuit through selective and inaccurate leaks.

My properly filed complaint was submitted three times: (1) via postal mail on December 15, 2023; (2) via postal mail on January 17, 2024; and (3) via hand-delivery by my legal team on May 1, 2024. We have photos and video recordings of each complaint being submitted.

If a Member of Congress—especially a House Leader—has to submit a complaint three times, just imagine the illegal tampering and mishandling of other complaints. The DC Circuit’s chief judge’s refusal to properly investigate the concerns raised by House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan and me — and instead inappropriately leaking misleading information to the press—is outrageous. The DC Circuit would be wise to quit playing political games. When Republicans control the White House and Congress, the administration of the DC Circuit will now be a top priority for oversight and accountability. In the meantime, we will begin investigating the matter immediately. The judiciary is no place for partisan politics.”

BACKGROUND:

On December 15, 2023, Stefanik’s top political aide submitted my complaint via U.S. mail. He filmed his dropping of the envelope, with clearly more than one page in it, in the U.S. mailbox.

The DC Circuit Executive’s Office sent Stefanik a December 28, 2023, letter stating it only received the first page of the complaint.

On January 17, 2024, a member of Stefanik’s outside legal team re-submitted her complaint via U.S. mail. He filmed his dropping of the envelope, with clearly more than one page in it, in the U.S. mailbox.

The DC Circuit Executive’s Office sent Stefanik a April 16, 2024, letter stating they did not receive her supplemented complaint and dismissed her complaint.

On May 1, 2024, two members of Stefanik’s outside legal team hand-delivered her complaint to the DC Circuit Executive’s Office.

Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted to pass theIllegitimate Court Counteraction Actwhich Stefanik introduced with Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX) to sanction International Criminal Court (ICC) officials who investigate or prosecute the United States and its allies, including Israel.

“I am proud to support the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act to stop the International Criminal Court’s baseless and illegal attempts to undermine our precious ally Israel as she fights for her very existence against Iranian-backed terrorists,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“The ICC chose the wrong side of history when they issued a warrant for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli Defense officials. As promised, these corrupt ICC bureaucrats will be held accountable for punishing our greatest ally Israel in her hour of need.”

In May 2024, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX) inintroducingthe Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act after reports that the ICC planned to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and other senior officials of the Israel Defence Forces.

Title: House GOP Leadership Statement on President Biden Election Year Border Charade
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer issued the following statement after President Biden issued his election year immigration Executive Order:

“President Biden's Executive Order is nothing more than a desperate political stunt to try and stabilize his plummeting poll numbers.

“From his first day in office, Biden has worked to implement a failed open border agenda which created this historic humanitarian and national security catastrophe. He has turned every American community into a border community and opened our country to violent criminals, terrorists, cartels, and poisonous drugs.

“This Executive action does nothing to end parole abuses or catch-and-release. It continues the administration’s abuse of the CBP One app. It does not reimplement President Trump’s successful Remain in Mexico policy. It provides no new resources for border patrol. It does nothing to deport the millions who have poured over our open border every year since Biden took office. And it will still allow scores of additional illegal immigrants to flood into our country before any so-called shutdown authority kicks in.

“Over a year ago, House Republicans passed the Secure the Border Act, which would actually fix the problem, but Joe Biden and Senate Democrats continue to drag their feet on taking meaningful action, sacrificing the safety and security of our communities.

“Americans can see right through Biden’s election-year stunt.”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik On The Sham Biden Trial and House Republicans' Commitment To Our Veterans & Most Precious Ally Israel
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to discuss last week’s verdict in New York which shows how corrupt, rigged, and unAmerican the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats.

Stefanik also discussed this week House Republicans will deliver for our veterans and continue our steadfast support for our most precious ally Israel.

Watch her remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below.

“Last week’s verdict in New York shows how corrupt, rigged, and unAmerican the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats.

The facts are clear: This was a zombie case illegally brought forward by a corrupt prosecutor doing Joe Biden’s political bidding in a desperate attempt to save Joe Biden’s failing and catastrophic campaign. The case hinged on the testimony of a convicted felon who was disbarred for lying and perjured himself to Congress. This sham trial was overseen by a corrupt and highly unethical judge who is a Biden donor and whose own family has directly profited from this case. This corrupt Democrat judge imposed a clearly unconstitutional gag order on President Trump and his team. The prosecution team that brought forward this case consisted of a Soros-funded, Far Left Democrat District Attorney on a vendetta, Democrat political operatives, and Democrat donors.

We must work and are committed to working around the clock to ensure President Trump is victorious this November to save America from Biden’s failed Far Left Democrat agenda and this illegal weaponization of the justice system against the American people.

This week, on the Floor, House Republicans will deliver for our veterans and continue our steadfast support for our most precious ally, Israel.

At every opportunity, Joe Biden has turned his back on Israel, most recently refusing to sanction the International Criminal Court following their politically motivated targeting of Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. The ICC must be immediately sanctioned. That is why today, House Republicans will bring Chip Roy’s bill, the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, to the House Floor to ensure needed guardrails to protect Israel and all our allies from baseless, undemocratic attacks by the international bureaucrats of this illegitimate court.

We will also bring up the MilCon-VA Appropriations bill to fully fund veterans’ programs and benefits and prohibit the Biden Administration from funding woke priorities. I am proud to announce that following many years of advocacy, this legislation will also secure Fort Drum in Upstate New York, in my district, as the third missile defense site on the East Coast, ensuring our policy of “peace through strength” by bolstering our nation’s defense.”

Title: Stefanik, Harris Demand Answers from USDA on Why They Blatantly Ignored a Congressional Directive Regarding WIC
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Andy Harris (R-MD) sent aletterto United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack inquiring why USDA did not follow a Congressional directive regarding the final rule, “Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Revisions in the WIC Food Packages,” which directed the secretary to not reduce the maximum monthly allowance with respect to milk.

In the final rulepublishedin the Federal Register on April 18, 2024, USDA acknowledged the language that was in the Appropriations bill that passed in a bipartisan, bicameral manner, but then blatantly ignored the Congressional directive.

The letter also requests USDA provide data supporting their claim that this change will not result in reduced participant redemption of the milk and dairy category, despite USDA’s own analysis showing a net-decrease of $28 million per year in milk and $8 million in cheese per year.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“In the explanatory statement accompanying the FY24 Appropriations package that became law on March 9, 2024, Congress included language stating, “The agreement directs the Secretary to not reduce the maximum monthly allowance with respect to milk when submitting a final rule to the proposed rule entitled "Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Revisions to the WIC Food Packages" published in the Federal Register on November 21, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 71090).””

The lawmakers continue,“The FY24 Appropriations packages passed Congress with bipartisan and bicameral support, which President Biden then signed into law. Members of Congress and appropriators expect that when language using the term “directs the Secretary” is signed into law regarding a proposed rule, that the Administration must then follow Congressional intent in carrying out the final rule.”

Title: Stefanik, Tenney Introduce Legislation to Address Medicare Advantage Wage Index Issue
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (R-NY) in co-leading legislation to address the significant under projection of Medicare Advantage (MA) local growth due to wage index reclassification.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses the Medicare Wage Index to help determine how much the federal government should reimburse hospitals that provide care for patients with original Medicare. The wage index adjusts a hospital’s payments based on labor costs for a specific geographic area. It is also common for health plans to use the same payment rates for hospitals caring for its MA members.

In 2023, CMS finalized its FY24 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Rule, updating the wage index and reclassified many hospitals as “rural.” The federal government did not give higher reimbursements to MA insurers. As a result, regional plans who solely service Upstate New York are being negatively impacted and without a fix from CMS, the wage index increase could significantly raise out-of-pocket costs and premiums for the 119,183 MA beneficiaries living in NY-21.

“Ensuring our seniors have access to the most affordable health plans and are able to maintain their popular Medicare Advantage benefits is one of my top priorities which is why I am proud to co-lead this legislation to address the wage index reclassification,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“Our community's seniors deserve continued access to affordable, high-quality healthcare,”said Congresswoman Claudia Tenney.“By adjusting the benchmark rates to reflect the increased costs faced by our regional plans, we can protect our seniors from losing essential coverage and experiencing higher premiums. This bill will ensure that Medicare Advantage plans continue to provide the robust benefits that so many members of our community rely on.”

Following aWashington Free Beaconpiecefrom earlier this month, Stefanik highlighted Ressa’s antisemitic history and condemned Harvard's selection and was met with criticism from Ressa, the Far Left, and mainstream media. TheWashington Free Beaconinvestigated and released accurate translations exposing Ressa’s blatant antisemitism.

"In a sad, but fitting end to their school year of disgrace, Harvard doubled down on their heinous path when they invited a known antisemite as their 2024 Commencement speaker, who then spewed antisemitic rhetoric at the Commencement ceremony.

Despite this antisemite's attempt to hide and falsely attack my office and media outlets who accurately reported on her writings, the translation in fact demonstrates her history of antisemitism as reportedhere."

Watertown Daily Times:Remembering Our Heroes, Honoring Sacrifice, and Supporting Survivors this Memorial Day

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

Memorial Day carries profound significance, offering a moment for somber reflection on the sacrifices made by our nation's service members who never returned home.

As the chief advocate of Fort Drum in Congress and one of the highest populations of veterans and retirees in New York State, I approach this day with a deep sense of reverence reflecting on the selflessness and courage exemplified by the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division who made the ultimate sacrifice.

These remarkable individuals are forever enshrined in history, their bravery serving as a constant source of inspiration for our grateful nation.

Each name inscribed on the roll call of fallen heroes represents a unique story of courage, commitment, and sacrifice.

This year, as we pay tribute to our fallen, we also mourn the loss of two distinguished members of the New York National Guard, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Casey Frankoski and Chief Warrant Officer 2 John M. Grassia. These brave service members who tragically lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Texas serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks faced by those in uniform, and the toll that service exacts on both the individual and their loved ones. As we honor their memory, we stand in solidarity with their families, friends, and fellow service members.

In the face of such loss, it is our duty as a nation to ensure the well-being of our service members and their families. I am proud to have successfully secured provisions within the 2024 national defense bill to extend support for Gold Star families who have experienced the loss of a loved one in service to our country.

These initiatives include granting remarried Gold Star Spouses access to commissary and recreational facilities. It is imperative that no Gold Star Spouse loses these critical benefits.

I will continue to advocate for our Gold Star Spouses, ensuring they maintain their survivor benefits which offer them the vital support they need during their most challenging times.

As we gather with loved ones this Memorial Day, let us not forget the true meaning of this occasion. Let us honor the memory of those who gave everything to our country by supporting those they left behind. Whether it's through volunteering, donating to veteran organizations, or advocating for policies that support our military families, each of us has a role to play in ensuring that the sacrifices of our fallen heroes are never forgotten.

As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I remain committed to placing service members, their families, and veterans at the forefront of my priorities. This Memorial Day, let's ensure that the sacrifices of our fallen heroes are never forgotten, and that their legacy of valor and sacrifice continues to inspire generations to come.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Calls Out Northwestern University President for Failing To Protect Jewish Students & Capitulating To The Antisemitic Pro-Hamas Mob on Campus
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, questioned Northwestern University President Michael Schill about failing to protect Jewish students, caving to the demands of the antisemitic, pro-Hamas mob on Northwestern’s campus, and failing to hold students who perpetuate antisemitic attacks accountable at an Education and the Workforce Committee hearing.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:President Schill, the ADL released its report card for universities’ responses to antisemitism and you’re aware that Northwestern was the only university whose grade was downgraded, correct?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Yes, I am aware of that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And isn’t it also true that the Northwestern earned an ‘F’ for your failure to respond and combat antisemitism and they called for your resignation, is that correct?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I have great respect for the ADL.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I’m not asking about your respect for the ADL, I’m asking is it a fact that you earned an ‘F’ and they called for your resignation?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I have great respect for the ADL. I am sad that they gave Northwestern an ‘F.’

Congresswoman Stefanik:But it’s true you got an ‘F.’ Yes. Moving on. Let me tell you why you earned an ‘F.’ I want to discuss what has been referred to as the Deering Meadows Agreement, your unilateral capitulation to the pro-Hamas, anti-Israel, antisemitic encampment. But let’s talk about what has occurred on this encampment. Isn’t it true that a Jewish Northwestern student was assaulted?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:So, I want to question the premise of your question.

Congresswoman Stefanik:No, no, no, no. I’m asking the questions. You’re answering. Wasn’t it true…

Northwestern President Michael Schill: Well my answer is not a capitulation.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I’m asking the question. You’re required to answer. Isn’t it true that a Jewish Northwestern student was assaulted?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:There are allegations that a Jewish student was assaulted. We are investigating those allegations.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Isn’t it true that a Jewish student was verbally harassed and stalked to Hillel?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:There are allegations of that sort and we are investigating them.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Isn’t it true that a Jewish student wearing a yarmulke was spat on?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:All of these are allegations that are being investigated.

Congresswoman Stefanik:How long are these investigations going to occur?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Well, if you remember the encampment was up just a few weeks ago so we believe at Northwestern in due process. We believe in investigations.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So, when are the investigations going to be finalized?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I’m not gonna be able to tell you that they’ll be finalized when the Conduct Office and the Title VI Office, which are well on this issue–

Congresswoman Stefanik:This is why you’ve learned an ‘F.’ Isn’t it true that a Jewish student was told to “go back to Germany and get gassed?”

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I’ve heard that alleged. Again, it is being investigated. We will investigate any claim of discrimination.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But it is a fact you said that there have been zero suspensions, zero expulsions.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Thus far. With lots of investigations on their way.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You said something that was very important. You said we did not give into demands but the commitments we made as part of the Deering Meadows Agreement, you said the word ‘commitments.’ Let me talk about those commitments. One of those commitments was funding two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years. Is that true?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:This is part of a program that we have had. We have used it with Afghanistan, Ukraine, it’s for war-torn countries.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But isn’t it true? I’m asking you. Okay. The other one is you will fund the full cost for five Palestinian undergrads.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:That is also part of the programs sponsored by our Buffett Institute. It is not a new program. It exists for people whose education and research has been interrupted.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But it was announced as part of the Deering Meadows Agreement, is that correct?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:It was part of it. It was a goal set forth in the Deering Meadows Agreement. It will also include people from Israel.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Who was consulted when you embarked on the Deering Meadows Agreement? Was the President’s Advisory Committee on Preventing Antisemitism and Hate consulted?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:That was not within the purview of the antisemitism and other forms of hate committee.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So, they were not consulted. Was Northwestern’s Board of Trustees consulted?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:The Chair of our Board was consulted.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But not the entire Board of Trustees?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Our Board of Trustees has over 120 members.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And isn’t it a fact that members of the Board of Trustees expressed dissatisfaction with your failure to consult them?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:There’s been some members of our Board of Trustees who have expressed dissatisfaction that they were not part of the decision making.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Did you consult with the General Counsel of Northwestern or an outsidecounselon the Deering Meadows Agreement before it was agreed to?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Are you aware that board members asked you this question and you said that you had not consulted?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Not the outside council. The General Counsel of the university was part of my team managing this problem.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Did you consult with two members of the advisory committee that I referenced previously, the anti-Israel professor, Jessica Winegar, and the Kellogg Professor, Nour Kteily. Were they consulted on the Deering Meadows Agreement?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I consulted with several members, including them, but also including the Hillel Director and also including the Chair of the Committee.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Let’s talk about the Hillel Director consultation. Isn’t it true that you asked the Hillel Director whether it was possible to hire an anti-Zionist, head of Hillel, Rabbi?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I did not. I absolutely did not. I would never hire anyone based upon their views of being Zionist or anti-Zionist. That is not what I do. That’s not what a great university does.

Congresswoman Stefanik:That’s not according to the whistleblowers that have come forward to this committee.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I can’t say who has talked to you or not talked to you but I can tell you the truth.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I can assure you many people have spoken to this committee.

…

Congresswoman Stefanik:President Schill, you talked about, you said there’s been a wide range of discipline after testifying there have been zero suspensions, zero expulsions, and you said ‘discipline has been meted out.’ How has discipline been meted out?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Discipline has run the gambit. That is the discipline that’s already completed, run the gambit from meetings with student affairs staff at the very lowest level of severity up to disciplinary probation, which means there is another offense students will be expelled or suspended.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And you testified when I asked about the Deering Meadows Agreement with the visiting Palestinian faculty members, isn’t it true that the university committed to fundraise above and beyond its current commitment as part of the Deering Meadows Agreement?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I did not commit. I don’t know who told you that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I’m reading it from the statement put out by the university that says, “The university commits to fundraise to sustain this program beyond this current commitment.” I’m reading your words put out by your office.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:That is a program that is not just about the Middle East. That is a program that is about war, war-torn areas all across this world. Ukraine for example.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But isn’t it a fact that that was part of the agreement to increase the commitment to that.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:I don’t think the agreement increased the commitment.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It did. I’m reading it for you. You put this out from your office, “The University commits to fundraise to sustain this program beyond this current commitment.” Is that no longer part of the Deering Meadows Agreement?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:When I hear beyond this commitment…

Congresswoman Stefanik:I’m reading what your office put out.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Are you asking me to interpret what my office put out? Or are you just reading it?

Congresswoman Stefanik:No, I’m asking you, isn't that the fact? What does ‘beyond this current commitment’ mean?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:What I read that to be is beyond this current commitment, the rest of the world, and over time.

Congresswoman Stefanik:That’s not…it’s specifically focused on the Palestinian faculty members. Let me ask you this…

Northwestern President Michael Schill:But we’re also going to be including Israeli faculty members.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It doesn’t say that in commitment. Why didn’t you include Israeli faculty members when you put out the Deering Meadows Agreement?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Because the Deering Meadows Agreement, which I actually never called it that, but the Deering Meadows Agreement was just a framework of an agreement that was reached with students at 4 o’clock in the morning.

Congresswoman Stefanik:At the pro-Hamas encampment.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:If you would like to see the entire program, go on our website and that will explain it to you and you will see it doesn’t violate Title XI.

Congresswoman Stefanik:No, I’m asking you about what the university put out. There is no mention of Israeli students or Israeli faculty, isn’t that the case?

Northwestern President Michael Schill:In the agreement that we reached, there wasn’t Israeli students there or Jewish students there.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Because they weren’t consulted. Isn’t that the fact? Jewish students were not consulted.

Northwestern President Michael Schill:Jewish and Israel students were not consulted with respect to the agreement.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Exactly.

Title: Stefanik, Moolenaar Urge DOJ to Investigate Communist China-Funded Group for FARA Violations
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) to Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General Merrick Garland urging the DOJ to open an investigation into the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which is funded by Communist Chinese drone company DJI, for potential violations of theForeign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

The Drone Advocacy Alliance is an advocacy group that, according to their website, is funded and maintained by DJI. The Drone Advocacy Alliance works to influence American citizens to lobby against legislation that would prohibit the use of DJI in America including theAmerican Security Drone Actand theCountering CCP Drones Act. The Drone Advocacy Alliance is working on behalf of a foreign adversary in the United States and should be registered under FARA, which requires individuals and organizations that are doing political or advocacy work on behalf of a foreign entity in the United States to register with the Department of Justice and to disclose their relationships, activities, receipts, and disbursements in support of their activities.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“FARA is intended to protect U.S. national security by requiring enhanced transparency into certain activities of organizations operating in the U.S. on behalf of foreign entities, including lobbying to influence U.S. policy.”

The lawmakers continue,“CCP-controlled drone company DJI is sponsoring and using the Drone Advocacy Alliance to market DJI drones as critical lifesaving tools that do not pose risks to U.S. national security. However, the opposite is the case. DJI is directly facilitating genocidal crimes, arming the Chinese military, and advancing the strategic objectives of the CCP, an adversary that threatens U.S. national security.”

Title: Stefanik Amendment to Force Lobbyists to Choose Between Representing the U.S. or Communist China is Included in the National Defense Bill
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, passed an amendment that prohibits the Department of Defense (DoD) from contracting with companies that retain lobbyists that also lobby for Chinese Military Companies. Read the amendmenthere.

“I am proud that my amendment forcing lobbying firms to choose between representing U.S. or Communist China’s interests will be included in this year’s national defense bill. It is reprehensible that American lobbying firms are advocating on behalf of companies that directly advance the modernization efforts of the Chinese military. If a lobbying firm chooses to represent a Chinese Military Company then they should be barred from representing any companies that contract with the U.S. Department of Defense,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Congresswoman Stefanik’s amendment will prohibit the Department of Defense from contracting with companies that retain lobbying firms that also lobby for Chinese Military Companies as defined by the DoD’s 1260H list.

Currently, many American lobbying firms represent Chinese Military Companies while also representing American defense contractors. This is a clear conflict of interest, represents serious cybersecurity risks, and could potentially give Chinese Military Companies advantages while they work to undermine U.S. national security.

In March, Fox Newsreportedthat Congresswoman Stefanik criticized former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for lobbying the DoD on behalf of a Communist Chinese drone company.

Title: Stefanik Votes to Advance the National Defense Bill
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, today voted to advance theNational Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)for Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) out of the Committee.

“As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am proud to bring the defense priorities of Fort Drum, the 10th Mountain Division, and all of Upstate New York to the highest levels as we work on the national defense bill for fiscal year 2025,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“The United States must promote peace through strength and prioritize fully investing in a strong national defense. While Communist China seeks to undermine our American way of life, Iran and its terrorist proxies are attacking our greatest ally Israel, and Russia is advancing its malign activities in Europe, there is a complete absence of leadership from the Biden Administration. This national defense bill which prioritizes emerging technology investment in Upstate New York, provides for our military families, and cuts through bureaucracy to equip our warfighters, has never been more important. I am proud to advance a defense bill that puts U.S. taxpayer dollars to good use by strengthening our military and supporting our service members.”

Stefanik secured numerous provisions to support Fort Drum, the 10th Mountain Division, and military families, including the following:

Strengthening Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division

Fighting for Wins for Upstate New York and the North Country

Supporting Our Service Members and Their Families

Confronting the CCP and Foreign Adversaries

Keeping Pace with Emerging Technologies in the 21st Century

Strengthening U.S.-Israel Defense Cooperation

Now, the House version of the NDAA will be brought to the House Floor for a full House debate and passage.

Title: Stefanik's Amendment to Prohibit the DoD from Operating Communist China’s Technology is Included in the National Defense Bill
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, passed an amendment that prohibits the Department of Defense (DoD) from procuring or operating light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology that is manufactured by our foreign adversaries including Communist China. Read the amendmenthere.

“As the U.S. military increases its use of autonomous unmanned systems, my amendment sends a clear signal that the U.S. cannot rely on untrusted LiDAR that jeopardizes our national security and undermines the competitiveness of American companies. LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that is used on many autonomous systems to map out the surrounding environments and we must ensure that no LiDAR in DoD systems is manufactured by our greatest strategic adversary Communist China,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Congresswoman Stefanik’s amendment will prohibit the DoD from operating or procuring LiDAR that is manufactured in China or by a foreign adversary.

Last year, Congresswoman Stefanik joined her colleagues in sending aletterto the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and Treasury urging them to investigate Chinese LiDAR companies for inclusion on their respective blacklists. In January, the Department of DefenseaddedChinese LiDAR company, Hesai, to its Chinese Military Company list which means Hesai directly works to advance the modernization goals of the Chinese military.

Title: Stefanik Amendment to Establish New Army Mountain Skill Identifiers Included in the National Defense Bill
Date: 2024

Washington, D.C. –Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, passed an amendment that requires the U.S. Army to establish Additional Skill Identifiers (ASIs) for soldiers who attend Advanced Mountaineering Courses. Read the amendmenthere.

“As the Chief Advocate for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division in Congress I am proud that my amendment to establish additional Skill Identifiers for Advanced Military Mountaineering will be included in this year’s national defense bill,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This will enable the 10th Mountain Division to better track, attract, and retain soldiers possessing the advanced alpine skills that are necessary for the 10th Mountain Division.”

Congresswoman Stefanik’s amendment requires the U.S. Army to develop and implement a plan to establish Additional Skill Identifiers for the following courses taught at the Army’s Mountain Warfare School: Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer), Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Winter), Rough Terrain Evacuation Course, Mountain Planner Course, Mountain Rifleman Course. Additionally, this language also requires the Army to establish a Skill Identifier for Officers and Warrant Officers who complete the following courses: Basic Military Mountaineer Course and Mountain Planner Course.

ASIs and Skill Identifiers (SIs) allow qualified mountaineers to be assigned to organizations where their skillsets are needed by making course completion searchable in U.S. Army Systems. Better tracking measures of skills developed at the AMWS would increase the accession of qualified leaders into their formation, resulting in increased proficiency and reduced training time and funding to qualify each new member for their team.

Title: House GOP Leadership Statement on the Senate Taking Up Failed Immigration Legislation This Week
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer issued the following statement on Senate Majority Leader Schumer’s announcement that the Senate will take up failed immigration legislation this week:

“For more than three years now, Congressional Democrats have stood by while the Biden Administration has opened our borders to criminal drug cartels, terrorists, and untold millions of illegal immigrants. Now, Leader Schumer is trying give his vulnerable members cover by bringing a vote on a bill which has already failed once in the Senate because it would actually codify many of the disastrous Biden open border policies that created this crisis in the first place. Should it reach the House, the bill would be dead on arrival.

Since the beginning of this Congress, the House has passed multiple pieces of bipartisan legislation to secure the border and deport criminal illegal immigrants, including the Laken Riley Act. All of them have been blocked by Schumer and Senate Democrats. The Secure the Border Act (H.R.2), which would end the border catastrophe by resuming construction of the border wall, ending the exploitation of parole, reinstating Remain in Mexico, and ending catch-and-release, has also been collecting dust on Schumer’s desk for over a year. If Senate Democrats were actually serious about solving the problem and ending the border catastrophe, they would bring up H.R. 2 and pass it this week.”

Title: ICYMI: New York Post: Reps. Jim Jordan, Elise Stefanik probe dismissal of misconduct complaint against DC judge over Trump comment

Washington, D.C. –In case you missed it, theNew York Postreported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent a letter to Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals requesting further information about the status of Stefanik'smisconduct complaintagainst Washington, DC federal judge Beryl Howell over potentially prejudicial statements about former President Donald Trump’s criminal case involving the 2020 election.

Read the full article below:

New York Post:Reps. Jim Jordan, Elise Stefanik probe dismissal of misconduct complaint against DC judge over Trump comment

Reps. Jim Jordan and Elise Stefanik are investigating the dismissal of Stefanik’s misconduct complaint against Washington, DC federal judge Beryl Howell over potentially prejudicial statements about former President Donald Trump’s criminal case involving the 2020 election

Jordan (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Stefanik (R-NY) wrote a letter Monday to Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals requesting further information about the status of the complaint.

The office of the DC Circuit Executive initially claimed that the complaint had been “wrongly filed,” according to a copy of the letter exclusively obtained by The Post, but the objection was still dismissed even after being resubmitted at least twice.

Stefanik and Jordan have asked for a briefing with the office of the DC Circuit Executive on the handling of the complaint.

That office did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Post

Stefanik initiated the complaint in December after Howell, who oversaw grand jury proceedings in the case against Trump for allegedly conspiring to unlawfully overturn his loss to Joe Biden, delivered a speech at the Women’s White Collar Defense Association (WWCDA) awards gala that suggested the former president was an “authoritarian.

In the speech, Howell broached the topic of the “big lies” surrounding the 2020 election that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot — and quoted approvingly from historian Heather Cox Richardson’s book “Democracy Awakening” that the lies “are springboards for authoritarians.”

The judge also praised President Biden’s Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who spearheaded the prosecutions of Trump in DC and Florida, where the former president was indicted last year for allegedly hoarding national security documents.

Biden, 81, was found earlier this year to have willfully retained classified documents after his vice presidency, but the Justice Department did not recommend bringing charges, in part because a jury was likely to have seen him as an “elderly man with a poor memory” rather than a devious criminal mastermind.

Biden, House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats have repeatedly denounced Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election as “the big lie” he told to his supporters.

“My DC judicial colleagues and I regularly see the impact of big lies at the sentencing of hundreds, hundreds of individuals who have been convicted for offensive conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, when they disrupted the certification of the 2020 presidential election at the US Capitol,” Howell said, according to NBC, after receiving the “champion award” alongside Monaco at the DC gala on Nov. 27.

Stefanik in her Monday letter pointed out again that Howell’s remarks “appear to violate Canon 2B of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which requires that judges ‘act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary’ and that a judge should not ‘lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge.'

Former President Barack Obama nominated Howell to the federal bench in 2010, and she served as the DC district court’s chief judge from 2016 until 2023. She is currently a senior judge at the court.

The Supreme Court is currently considering an appeal in the Jan. 6 prosecution, as Trump’s attorneys have argued the former president had immunity to contest 2020 election results while in office.

The DC district and circuit court of appeals both rejected motions to dismiss the case based on the immunity claims

The Supreme Court’s decision is expected by the end of June, before the high court goes into recess for the summer.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Meets with Israeli Prime Minister, Minister of Strategic Affairs, Visits Sites of October 7th Terrorist Attack with IDF
Date: 2024

Content:
Jerusalem, Israel –Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer respectively to discuss efforts to defend Israel from Iran-backed terrorist proxies and House Republicans’ unwavering support for the United States’ most precious ally.

She also visited Kfar Aza, a kibbutz in southern Israel and the Tribe of Nova music festival grounds, two of the first sites Hamas terrorists targeted during the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Chairwoman Stefanik also received a briefing from IDF Major Liad Diamond on Israel’s security and defense measures as well as the role the recently passed aid package will play in supporting these efforts.

“I had a productive meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today in which I reiterated House Republicans’ unwavering support for Israel, our most precious ally,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.“Prime Minister Netanyahu’s work with President Trump to bring about the Abraham Accords marked a monumental step toward peace in the region. As he leads Israel through one of the darkest moments in its history we must stand unequivocally by Israel against Iran and their proxies who seek to destroy the only democracy in the Middle East.”

“Today I met with Israel’s Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer who has played a critical role in maintaining the strong, everlasting relationship between the United States and Israel. House Republicans and the American people firmly support our most precious ally’s right to exist and defend itself against heinous threats,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.

“Today, I paid a solemn visit to Kfar Aza, a kibbutz in southern Israel that Hamas terrorists viciously attacked on October 7th. I am heartbroken for the families who faced unimaginable loss at the hands of the heinous barbaric Hamas terrorists,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.“While there, I also received a briefing from IDF Major Liad Diamond on Israel’s security and defense measures as well as the impact of U.S. aid.”

“The Tribe of Nova music festival was among the first sites Hamas terrorists targeted on October 7th,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.“Hamas murdered at least 360 innocent civilians here, Israelis and Americans, and just last week the IDF discovered the bodies of more Israeli hostages taken during the attack. This site continues to serve as a reminder of the existential threat facing our most precious ally. We must Stand with Israel.”

Title: Stefanik Delivers Historic Address on Antisemitism and U.S. Support for Israel at Israeli Knesset
Date: 2024

Content:
Jerusalem, Israel– Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik delivered an address to members of the Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem following an invitation from Speaker Amir Ohana highlighting how America stands with Israel and House Republicans’ fight to protect Jewish students on American college campuses.

Rep. Stefanik is the highest ranking member of the House of Representatives to visit Israel since the October 7th terrorist attacks.

Watch her full address here.

Read her full address below.

“Thank you, Speaker Ohana, for your kind introduction and for inviting me here today. Mr. Speaker, MK Moshe Tur-Paz, MK Dan Illouz, distinguished guests, and dear friends: I am profoundly honored to speak in the hallowed halls of your Knesset, in your eternal capital, the holy city of Jerusalem, at this time of historic consequence for Israel and the Jewish people.

Today, I stand before you not just as a leader in the United States Congress, but as a lifelong admirer, supporter, and true friend of Israel and the Jewish people.  You see I am lucky enough to have had the privilege of traveling here many times before, but I must confess that this time feels different.

The stakes are higher. Our sense of moral, patriotic duty feels heightened, renewed.

226 days ago, we witnessed the most vicious, brutal attack on Israel and the Jewish people since the Holocaust, a barbaric terrorist attack that claimed more than 1,200 innocent lives. Civilian women, children, and the elderly were ripped from their homes and massacred. Raped — Beheaded — Jewish families were bound together and burned. Babies burned alive. Atrocities of humanity.

We must never forget, and we must never relent.

Israelis, Americans, and others were savagely kidnapped from their homes, beaten, tortured, and taken hostage to the terror tunnels beneath Gaza. And we must remind the world every day that there are still over 120 souls held hostage – 226 days of captivity– including Americans, held by Hamas terrorist thugs.

Let me be very clear: We will not rest until the hostages are back home.

This period calls to mind the many times forces of evil have tried to destroy Israel and the Jewish people. Since Israel’s first days of existence there have been those who have sought out its destruction. You see, we saw the same eliminationist goal in 1948, during the Fedayeen raids of the 1950s and 60s, in the ‘67 war, the ‘73 war, the successive wars against Hamas in Gaza, and again, on that dark day, October 7th, 2023.

What we are witnessing today is a story of the forces of good versus evil. The forces of civilization against the forces of barbarism, of humanity versus depravity.

I want to share something I heard the writer Douglas Murray say a couple weeks ago, which I’ve witnessed for myself here this week: Israel chooses life. Murray is right, but let me go further. In choosing life, Israel fulfills Isaiah’s prophecy, to be a light unto nations, fighting for its survival and future in one very tough neighborhood. And I get the sense and I know that the people of Israel know this.

In the week after October 7th, 360,000 Israelis reported for military duty, flying home from around the world. That's the equivalent of 20 million Americans—more Americans than served in World War II. Many of these courageous fighters are but of college age in America. What a striking comparison: Young Israelis heeding the call of duty, fighting for their families, their people, and their homeland while the pro-Hamas apologists on so-called elite campuses across America are, in a paroxysm of blood lust, cosplaying Hamas, calling for ‘intifada’ and genocide with signs saying ‘Final Solution.’ Chanting ‘Death to Israel.’ And chanting ‘Death to America.’

We know what it must look like, but I want you to know something. Those views, though given airtime by some radical Democrat Members of Congress, those views do not reflect the views of the American people. The American people stand firmly behind you. And we’re already seeing the majority in the body in which I serve, the United States Congress, fight back and turn the tide.

Let me repeat: America is firmly behind Israel and the Jewish people.

And this goes back to our nation’s founding. In 1790, America’s Founding Father George Washington wrote a letter to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island, expressing America’s founding impulse, a devotion to religious pluralism. He wrote that the United States would ‘give to bigotry no sanction’ and ‘persecution no assistance.’ He further wrote: ‘May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.’ As long as I serve the American people, I will defend George Washington’s vision of religious pluralism and freedom. Today, this means crushing antisemitism at home, and supplying the State of Israel with what it needs, when it needs it, without conditions, to achieve total victory in the face of evil.

For all of you, total victory needs no explanation. But total victory is something too many others throughout the free world fail to understand. Total victory starts—but only starts—with wiping those responsible for October 7th off the face of the earth. There can be no retrievable dignity for Hamas and its backers.

When they chose rape, the torture of civilians, and the mutilation of infants as weapons of terrorism, they left no alternative to this just war. When the genocidal zealots running Iran lobbed missiles at this very city, they removed any doubt as to their hideous intentions. Chants of ‘Death to America’ are not hollow slogans. They are a promise that what happened here on October 7th could happen in the United States—unless Hamas and its Jihadist accomplices are eliminated.

My country, and all countries, must stare truth in the face: This is not Israel’s fight alone. It is also our fight, the West’s fight. In truth, total victory is about more than responding to one attack, it’s about restoring a way of life. It is about securing the Jewish State so that it no longer faces threats of annihilation from any actor, whether from Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, or any other. And it is the United States’ high honor, and high responsibility, to support Israel’s effort.

I have been clear at home and I will be clear here: There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel – aid that was duly passed by the Congress. There is no excuse to ease sanctions on Iran, paying a $6 billion ransom to the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, or to dither and hide while our friends fight for their lives. No excuse. Full stop.

That’s why I’m proud to have sponsored, or backed, every measure to aid Israel that has come before the United States Congress. Every single one. It’s why I, as a senior Member on the House  Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Committee, we have helped secure billions of dollars for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, the Iron Beam, anti-tunneling technology, counter-UAS systems, and further development of emerging technologies—most recently in the supplemental aid package passed just last month. It’s why I led the calls for the White House to speak out against the corrupt ICC.

And it’s why, for years, I have been a leading proponent and partner to President Trump in his historic support for Israeli independence and security including: moving the U.S. Embassy to its rightful place in Jerusalem, the negotiation of the historic Abraham Accords, the greatest stride toward peace normalization in more than a quarter century, adopting the strategy to align the U.S. Central Command with Israel, a change that fostered daily communications with the IDF, joint exercises, and crucial coordination with British and Arab partners that helped defend against the Iranian attack, and finally, President Trump’s wise decision to call out UNRWA for what it is—a hive of antisemitism—and to eliminate every dollar of its U.S. funding.

When the enemy is inside the gates of the United Nations, America must be the one to call it by its name and destroy it. President Trump understood that, and B’ezrat hashem, we will return to that strategy soon.

But you know as well as I that the enemy is inside more than just the gates of the United Nations. It is also in powerful western institutions in my country and beyond, where the virus, the vile virus of antisemitism is spreading. This is why total victory means not just physical self-defense but ideological self-defense.

As chair of the House Republican Conference, I’m proud that House Republicans have passed bipartisan resolutions in support of Israel, called out antisemitism in the halls of Congress, and brought transparency to the antisemitic propaganda pushed on American students and paid for by foreign adversaries. We have passed bills like the DETERRENT Act to ensure our foreign enemies cannot poison the minds of American students.

I also serve as a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee, where I led the charge to expose this moral rot of antisemitism infecting our supposed most ‘elite’ higher education institutions.  When we heard from Jewish students, faculty members, and staff about antisemitic attacks taking place on their campuses, I demanded Congress host a public hearing to hold colleges and universities accountable for their failure to combat antisemitism and their failure to protect Jewish members of their community.

And I know you all saw that hearing because the world saw that hearing.

And I want to take you into that moment. My question was the last question of the hearing. The most junior member of the committee yielded me her remaining three minutes. And I had asked questions earlier in the hearing, going back and forth with the president of Harvard, now former president, and I wasn’t getting direct answers. So when thinking through the last question, which was not pre-written, I wrote down in pencil right ahead of time and thought to myself, ‘how can I ask this in a straightforward, moral way to force them to answer correctly?’ And that question was: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct on bullying and harassment?”

And one after the other, after the other answered ‘It depends on the context.’ And the world heard. Let me tell you: it does not depend on the context.

And over the years, I’ve been in a lot of high profile committee hearings over the years, and I’ve never witnessed the moral bankruptcy and depravity of witnesses like I did in that hearing. In one week, there were over one billion views worldwide. It is now well into the multiple billions.  And there is a reason that it is the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress. And that is because it exposed the moral rot at the highest levels of these so-called ‘elite’ universities. And as I said after the resignations: two down, so many to go.

That hearing set off an earthquake. Their disgraceful attempt to contextualize genocide of Jews is a symptom of decades of moral decay, intellectual laziness, and dangerous radical groupthink at these so-called ‘elite’ institutions across society. We have put colleges and universities on notice and expanded this investigation to ensure every Jewish and Israeli student, faculty member, and staff member is protected on campus. We’re looking at foreign donations to universities, the failure to protect Jewish students, the federal accreditation system, the assault on viewpoint diversity and free speech, the antisemitism inherent in woke DEI, the erosion in academic integrity, and the extent to which U.S. taxpayers have been forced to bankroll the political indoctrination of young Americans at these institutions.

The days of unchecked antisemitism, of anti-Jewish racism, must be over. We will hold the purveyors of the oldest hatred accountable.

Ladies and gentlemen, this visit has renewed my sense of the stakes of the battle we are in. I want to leave you with one message today, it’s this:  The majority of Americans support you and we always will. Since President Truman’s recognition of Israel 11 minutes after David Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence 76 years and 5 days ago, America stands with Israel.

We must not let the extremism in so-called ‘elite’ corners conceal the deep, abiding love for Israel among the American people. Most Americans feel a strong connection to your people. They have opened their hearts to you in this dark hour.

And I have seen it everywhere: in conversations with my constituents - hardworking families, small businesspeople, farmers, veterans, seniors, and students alike.

And the reason for this love is no mystery to me.

I was raised in Upstate New York, I attended an all-girls day school right next door to a synagogue. I grew up attending b'nai mitzvot of childhood and family friends and have been welcomed into many homes for Shabbat dinner. I’ve celebrated with my friends the birth of their children, attending baby namings and bri-tote, and signing a ketubah at a friend’s wedding.

My love and respect for the Jewish people and the people of Israel is lifelong and deep.

And I have been to Israel many times – even before I was a Member of Congress.  As a Harvard undergraduate, I made my first trip to Israel to study national security policy on a fellowship with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. And I am pleased to say that I have been many times since–most recently, returning as a Member of Congress in May of last year to help lead an Intelligence Committee delegation meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. During each and every visit to Israel, I am reminded of the fundamental fact that our peoples share an enduring bond, forged over centuries.

Both Jefferson and Lincoln called America, in one way or another, ‘the last best hope on earth.’ When I come here, to Jerusalem, I sense a shared destiny, one embedded in your national anthem, “Hatikvah” – ‘the hope.’ Israel is indeed a miracle, an outpost of freedom, of Western values, of civilization, a striking example of human potential, the physical embodiment of Herzl’s maxim: ‘If you will it, it is no dream.’ It’s this same founding ethos that we prize in America – The American Dream, which says that with hard work, the right values, you can build a life for yourself, your family, and your community. Herzl’s Dream and the American Dream. These dreams are precious and we must cherish, protect, and fight for them.

We know we have some difficult days ahead to ensure this always remains true. Prime Minister Netanyahu recently said that if Israel must stand alone, it will. I am here to tell you that it is our duty as Americans that Israel does not stand alone.

We must never let Israel stand alone.

I am confident, in the end, that our relationship will not just endure but emerge stronger than ever before. Israel, keep fighting. We are with you. God Bless Israel and God Bless the United States of America. Thank you for this tremendous honor.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Delivers Address at Knesset, Meets with Senior Israeli Officials, Hostage Families, and Visits Historic City of David
Date: 2024

Content:
Jerusalem, Israel– Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik delivered an address in the Knesset at the invitation of Speaker of the Knesset Amir Ohana. Following the address she met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Speaker Ohana, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, and families of those still held hostage by Hamas to discuss the American people’s steadfast support for Israel and the Americans and Israelis still held hostage by Hamas.

Earlier in the day she returned to the historic City of David archeological site of shared importance to Christians and Jews worldwide. Chairwoman Stefanik is the highest ranking elected Republican and Member of Congress to visit Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks.

Watch her full address here.

“It was an honor to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog today. When he visited the United States last year to deliver a historic joint address to Congress, President Herzog shared a message of allyship and the close bond between our nations. Today I’m in Israel during one of its darkest periods in history to share a message of our own: the United States must always stand with Israel,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.

“Today I met with the Speaker of the Knesset Amir Ohana to discuss House Republicans' unwavering support for Israel in its fight for survival against the vicious Iran-backed Hamas terrorists. The Biden Administration’s betrayal of our most precious ally does not represent the vast majority of Americans who unequivocally support Israel’s right to exist and defend itself,” Chairwoman Stefanik said.

“I met with families of the hostages who shared horrific and tragic stories stemming from the brutal October 7th terror attacks. Let me be very clear: We will not rest until the hostages are back home,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.

“Honored to return to the City of David today to highlight the incredible archaeological research at one of the oldest cities mentioned in the Bible and a significant site of our shared Christian and Jewish heritage. Thank you Ze'ev Orenstein for the informative tour and gracious hospitality,”Chairwoman Stefanik said.

Title: ICYMI: New York Times: Stefanik to Denounce Biden, and Praise Trump, in Speech to Israel’s Parliament
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –In case you missed it, theNew York Timesreported that House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik will become the highest-ranking House Republican to speak before Israel’s Parliament since the barbaric Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th.

Read the full article below:

New York Times:Stefanik to Denounce Biden, and Praise Trump, in Speech to Israel’s Parliament

“Representative Elise Stefanik of New York will be the highest-ranking House Republican to address the Israeli Parliament since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack with a speech on Sunday that is expected to deliver a forceful rebuke of President Biden and his fellow Democrats while presenting her party as the true allies of the Jewish state.

Ms. Stefanik’s speech comes as the Biden White House is urging Israel to end the war in Gaza, and it builds on the Republican political strategy to capitalize on Democratic divisions over Israel’s response to the terrorist attacks.

That strategy, which has played out in Congress for the past six months, has included a largely symbolic House vote on Thursday aimed at rebuking Mr. Biden for pausing an arms shipment to Israel and compelling his administration to deliver those weapons quickly.

Mr. Biden recently put a hold on military aid out of concern that Israel would use the weapons on Rafah, a crowded city in southern Gaza. The administration has also told Congress that it plans to sell more than $1 billion in new weapons to Israel.

“I have been clear at home, and I will be clear here,” Ms. Stefanik is expected to say in her speech, according to a prepared version of her remarks reviewed by The New York Times. “There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel.”

Her remarks also appear designed to curry favor with former President Donald J. Trump, who has mentioned Ms. Stefanik, a former George W. Bush White House aide and staunch defender of Mr. Trump, as a potential vice-presidential candidate.

While a time-honored adage of American politics has held that partisanship ends at the water’s edge, Ms. Stefanik’s remarks may help strengthen her bona fides with the former president by paying little mind to the principle and decorum behind that unwritten rule.

Ms. Stefanik has positioned herself as one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal defenders in Congress, a role she first staked out during his first impeachment in 2019. Her prepared remarks for Sunday mention Mr. Trump by name three times while highlighting several of his administration’s accomplishments, including a package of Middle East deals known as the Abraham Accords and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

“We must not let the extremism in elite corners conceal the deep, abiding love for Israel among the American people,” Ms. Stefanik plans to say. “Americans feel a strong connection to your people. They have opened their hearts to you in this dark hour.”

In addition to her remarks at Jerusalem Hall in the Knesset, Ms. Stefanik will meet with Israeli officials, visit religious sites and tour locations targeted in the Oct. 7 attacks.

Ms. Stefanik has played a high-profile role in the congressional investigations into antisemitism on college campuses. Her questioning of the Harvard and University of Pennsylvania presidents ultimately lead to their resignations, delivering to Ms. Stefanik her biggest star turn this Congress.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Corrupt NY Judge Overseeing Sham Case Against Trump Receiving "Caution" for Breaking Judicial Conduct Code
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement regarding corrupt Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan receiving a "caution" from the Commission on Judicial Conduct for clearly violating the rules on prohibited political activity by contributing to Joe Biden’s campaign:

“Democrat Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan, who donated to Biden and whose adult daughter is raising millions from Merchan’s unprecedented trial of President Trump, knows he must recuse under New York statute. And the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct just reprimanded Merchan for his inappropriate political donations in 2020. America is starting to understand Merchan is a corrupt judge, presiding over blatant Biden Democrat lawfare and election interference against Trump—that is lining his family’s pockets. Merchan has disgraced our justice system in New York.”

Title: Stefanik Announces Agreement Between Amtrak and CN to Make Track Improvements and Avoid Future Summer Stoppages of Service
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced that following her advocacy, Amtrak and the Canadian National Railway (CN) have reached an agreement to make the track improvements needed to prevent any future summer stoppages of service of Amtrak’s Adirondack Line.

“I am proud to announce that following my advocacy, Amtrak and CN have reached an agreement that will allow them to continue serving Upstate New York and North Country communities that rely on the Adirondack Line for transportation,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This result will allow tourism to flourish through the summer months, strengthening economic development in the region and our partnership with our Canadian neighbors.”

Service of the Adirondack Line is expected to be modified in the coming weeks to ensure completion of the track work needed to help increase reliability of the service during the summer months in the future.

"While the journey to a favorable conclusion has seemed longer than the railway itself, we welcome the finalization of an agreement between Amtrak and CN that will avoid another summer long shutdown,"says Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce."This means that the six-week suspension starting May 20th will allow the heat related challenges on a stretch of the CN line north of the border to be fully resolved so that, when service resumes at the end of June, we should see no more rail condition interruptions for hopefully years to come. And that means service will be back for most of the summer and can resume the increase in ridership we were seeing before these suspensions. We thank our federal representatives and especially Congresswoman Stefanik for the persistent pursuit of this needed agreement and commitment."

“The Adirondack Train that runs between New York City and Montreal is an important mode of transportation in the North Country for residents and visitors alike. The closures in past years have been detrimental to our communities and I am pleased that they are finally addressing this issue so that we can keep the train operating in the future,"said Assemblyman Billy Jones (D-Chateaugay Lake).

“I’m pleased to see an agreement be reached to make significant upgrades to this essential rail service. Once these ongoing repairs are completed, riders will enjoy a much better experience,”said State Senator Dan Stec.

In June 2023, CN implemented safety restrictions of 10mph which shut down service of the Adirondack Line when the temperature reached 86 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, citing concerns about the condition of the track. As a result, Amtrak suspended service north of Saratoga Springs for seventy-nine days.

In September 2023, Congresswoman Stefaniksenta letter demanding that Amtrak and CN provide a plan of action to avoid a future summer stoppage of service of the Amtrak Adirondack Line. The past ten months, Stefanik’s office has been engaged with Amtrak and CN, advocating to keep the Adirondack Line fully functional. Stefanik has been a longstanding advocate of the Adirondack Line. Following her continuousadvocacy, Amtrak fullyreopenedthe Adirondack Line in April 2023 after it was closed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: At Every Opportunity Joe Biden & Chuck Schumer Have Failed To Support Israel
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to discuss the catastrophic failure by Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Far Left Democrats to stand by our most precious ally Israel in their fight against Hamas terrorists.

Stefanik also addressed how Joe Biden is hiding behind Executive Privilege to prevent the American public from hearing how he knowingly mishandled classified intelligence for personal, financial gain.

Watch her remarks here.

View a transcript of her remarks below.

“Just a brief comment on the breaking news this morning: We continue to see unprecedented and illegal lawfare against President Trump whether it's the sham Alvin Bragg trial in New York City or the weaponized DOJ. Joe Biden disregarded over 250 years of Constitutional Executive Privilege when he orchestrated an unprecedented raid on President Trump’s home to obtain Presidential records that President Trump was allowed to have under the Presidential Records Act. Now, Joe Biden is hiding behind Executive Privilege to prevent the American public from hearing how he knowingly mishandled classified intelligence for personal, financial gain.

On Israel, the lack of leadership we're seeing from the Democrat Party led by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer is disgraceful. They have turned their backs on supporting our most precious ally Israel in a time of existential need, instead choosing to placate the Far Left Democrat radicals who are now the antisemitic political base of their Party. Schumer, time and time again, vehemently blocked our Israel aid package and publicly rebuked Prime Minister Netanyahu, the leader of an ally at war. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has done everything in his power to give Iran and its terrorist proxies the green light to escalate attacks, withholding critical aid, pressuring Israel to surrender, and continuing a failed foreign policy of appeasement.

At every opportunity, Joe Biden has failed to support Israel. Under Joe Biden, our adversaries no longer fear us, and our allies cannot rely on us. If Joe Biden wanted to ensure Israel could defend itself, he would, yet he refuses. The American people will judge Joe Biden for this failure, and history will judge Joe Biden for this failure as well.

House Republicans will not be deterred. We will put this legislation on the Floor this week. We will put President Trump back in the White House, grow our Majority, take the Senate, and together, Republicans will always stand with Israel and its right to exist.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Calls Out Biden’s Coordinated Lawfare Campaign Against His Political Opponents
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, the Judiciary Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government held a hearing to examine the use of lawfare tactics to weaponize the rule of law. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik questioned Partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron Robert Costello on the unprecedented nature of the deployment of Joe Biden’s political operatives to conduct a coordinated, multi-front lawfare campaign meant to keep President Donald Trump in the courtroom and away from the campaign trail.

Watch her full line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Oh, I love being able to respond to the novice from New York. First of all, thank you so much for stating the obvious that political lawfare is in fact election interference. That’s what we’re seeing with the sham Alvin Bragg trial. Thank you also to the novice freshman member from New York highlighting that withholding military aid to an ally for a political purpose just like Joe Biden is doing to Israel. Always grateful for you stepping in.Mr. Costello, in your opening statement you said that in the over 50 years serving as a lawyer, you “have never seen the types of politically motivated cases that have been brought in this presidential election season. These political cases are being used as a weapon of war to damage, defeat, or impede political adversaries, and their allies. Instead of political warfare, it is lawfare, a cancer upon our collective judicial system.” I want to begin with Alvin Bragg’s weaponized sham trial in New York. Isn’t it true that in Alvin Bragg’s campaign for Manhattan DA, Bragg specifically ran on going after President Donald Trump?

Mr. Robert Costello:That is true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Isn’t it true that Bragg’s predecessor Cy Vance declined to prosecute President Trump?

Mr. Robert Costello:That is true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And the FEC also did not prosecute President Trump.

Mr. Robert Costello:That is true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And the DOJ did not prosecute President Trump in this case.

Mr. Robert Costello:The DOJ referring to the U.S. attorney for the Southern District?

Congresswoman Stefanik:Correct.

Mr. Robert Costello:Absolutely true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And one of the reasons the Southern District of New York turned down this case was because the supposed star witness, according to Alvin Bragg, Michael Cohen, was totally “unworthy of belief.” Isn’t that true?

Mr. Robert Costello:Without a doubt.

Congresswoman Stefanik:This is the same Michael Cohen who plead guilty to seven counts in an indictment that had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump and actually predated the first time he met President Trump, correct?

Mr. Robert Costello:Absolutely true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And in fact, this is the same Michael Cohen, who perjured himself to Congress. Isn’t that true?

Mr. Robert Costello:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:In fact, when called as a witness in this sham trial, Cohen was asked directly if he was honest during his testimony to Congress. He said “no,” admitting perjury. But it’s not just Bragg’s case that is a total sham and an illegal political lawfare going after Joe Biden‘s top political opponent, Donald Trump. This rot goes deep, all the way up to the top in the Oval Office. Because when Congress referred this admission of Cohen’s perjury to Joe Biden’s DOJ, isn’t it true that the DOJ has refused to prosecute?

Mr. Robert Costello:That is true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Isn’t it correct that Michael Colangelo, who was the third highest ranking official in Biden’s DOJ was transferred to Bragg’s office to run this weaponized prosecution of President Trump. Isn’t that true?

Mr. Robert Costello:Not only true but it’s unheard of.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Unheard of. It’s a disgrace. Do you agree that this weaponization of lawfare goes straight to the top with the purpose of helping Joe Biden‘s failing presidential campaign?

Mr. Robert Costello:The circumstantial evidence definitely supports that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And the unconstitutional gag order on President Trump from New York Judge Merchan is unprecedented lawfare?

Mr. Robert Costello:As far as I know, absolutely.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And let’s go to the daughter of the judge. Isn’t it true that she is raising millions of dollars off of this sham case?

Mr. Robert Costello:Well, I have to say, I read that in the media. I don’t know it of my own knowledge.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It is true.

Mr. Robert Costello:Thank you.

Congresswoman Stefanik:One additional question. I want to talk about the rigged and unprecedented jury selection process. Isn’t it true that Bragg’s team asked the jurors if they followed Trump on social media?

Mr. Robert Costello:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And isn’t it true that they did not ask any of the potential jurors if they followed Biden on social media?

Mr. Robert Costello:Or Michael Cohen.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Or Michael Cohen.

Mr. Robert Costello:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And isn’t it true that 87% of the jurors said they voted for Joe Biden.

Mr. Robert Costello:That’s true.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Is this unprecedented and lawfare jury shopping?

Mr. Robert Costello:Without a doubt.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Without a doubt. Political lawfare for the purpose of election interference to go after Donald Trump. Do you agree?

Mr. Robert Costello:Totally.

Congresswoman Stefanik:This is one of the reasons that Trump’s polls continue to skyrocket and it’s why President Trump will win in 2024, to end the illegal and warped weaponization of the justice system, because if they can illegally go after Trump, they can go after anyone.

Title: Stefanik Introduces Bill to Bolster the U.S. Drone Industry
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik introduced theDrones for First Responders (DFR) Actto implement a new tariff on Communist Chinese-controlled drones and use the tariff revenue to establish a new grant program to help first responders, critical infrastructure providers, and farmers, purchase secure drones. This legislation will increase the competitiveness of U.S. drone manufacturers and enhance U.S. national security.

Currently, 90% of drones operated by U.S. first responders are made in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Communist China has used aggressive subsidies, direct government investment, and favorable regulations to dominate the global drone market and undercut U.S. drone manufacturers. These unfair trade practices have allowed CCP-controlled drone companies to monopolize the U.S. drone market.

The Department of Defense has twice certified that PRC-based drone manufacturer, DJI, is actively advancing the PRC military’s capabilities and prohibits the U.S. military from operating PRC-drones. Additionally, a2017 Homeland Security Intelligence Bulletinand a2024 CISA industry alertstate that PRC drones present significant risks to U.S. critical infrastructure and national security.

“I am proud to introduce the Drones for First Responders Act to stop the CCP’s influence over our nation and increase the competitiveness of U.S. drone manufacturers by establishing a revenue neutral grant program to help Americans purchase drones securely made by the U.S. and our allies,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“With this legislation, American drone manufacturers will be able to compete with Communist Chinese-controlled drones and enhance U.S. national security.”

“Chinese drones pose an unacceptable surveillance risk,”said Chairman Moolenaar.“I am proud to co-sponsor Rep. Stefanik’s legislation to help American first responders transition from foreign adversary drone technology to American made equipment as soon as possible.”

“The United States should not be reliant on Communist China for drones that are critical to our nation’s first responder operations,”said Congressman Rob Wittman.“I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Drones for First Responders Act to enable our first responders to purchase secure drones, increase the competitiveness of American drone manufacturers, and enhance U.S. national security. We simply cannot cede control of the drone market to the Chinese Communist Party.”

"A strong U.S. drone manufacturing industrial base represents a strategic imperative for the U.S. We can, and must, do more to bolster drone security for end users while supporting U.S. values, aviation leadership, and investments in manufacturing jobs. Grant programs are a common-sense mechanism for getting secure, capable drones into the hands of public safety, critical infrastructure, and agriculture applications, and with the DFR Act's revenue raising measure, the grants are at no additional cost to the taxpayer. AUVSI is grateful for Representative Stefanik's leadership on this issue and is proud to support the DFR Act. We challenge Congress pass the DFR Act and to then build off this momentum and pursue additional demand signals that will further kickstart the flywheel for U.S. innovation and manufacturing in the drone space,"said Michael Robbins, President and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI).

"Phasing-in tariffs tied with subsidies to incubate new manufacturing industries is precisely the kind of policy Congress should be embracing,”said Michael Stumo CEO of the Coalition for A Prosperous America.

Rep. Stefanik was joined by Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Reps. Rob Wittman (R-VA), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), and Jim Banks (R-IN).

In March 2024, the bipartisanCountering CCP Drones Actintroduced by Congresswoman Elise Stefanikadvancedthrough the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously. Passage during this markup sets this bill up for consideration on the House floor.

In March,Fox Newsreportedthat Congresswoman Stefanik criticized former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for lobbying the Department of Defense working on behalf of a Communist Chinese drone company.

In January 2024, Congresswoman Stefanikreleaseda statement with Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Mike Gallagher demanding that Communist Chinese drones be banned from the United States. This came after the release of the new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) report detailing how Communist Chinese drones are actively spying on America’s critical infrastructure and present a legitimate national security threat.

In November 2023, Congresswoman Elise StefanikjoinedChairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party and bipartisan lawmakers in a letter urging the Biden administration to open investigations into Autel Robotics, a PRC drone manufacturer.

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik Joins the Guy Benson Show To Discuss Democrats' Refusal To Stand With Israel, Antisemitism In Higher Education, And Much More
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News Radio's theGuy Benson Showto discuss Joe Biden’s failed foreign policy, Chuck Schumer’s failure to support Israel, the ongoing congressional investigation into holding campus leadership accountable for failing to protect Jewish students and faculty, and the fight against antisemitism in America’s education system.

Listen to her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Joe Biden Withholding Aid To Israel & Chuck Schumer’s Refusal To Bring Forward A Vote On Israel Aid Bill:

“My response is: This is disgraceful. The lack of leadership we're seeing from the Democrat Party led by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in the Senate where they have turned their backs on supporting our most precious ally Israel in a time of existential need. And let's take a step back, Guy. October 7th, the atrocities and terrorist attacks committed by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists was the bloodiest day since the Holocaust. We must stand as Americans with Israel as they eradicate this terrorist threat that fundamentally doesn't believe Israel has a right to exist. So we fully stand by Israel using every tool they have and all of the military aid we passed, which was the intent of Congress, to eradicate Hamas. I also serve on the House Intel Committee, Guy, and I can tell you that the next time I have those agencies as well as this Administration in front of us in that Committee, I will be demanding accountability because if it turns out they're withholding intel for political purposes because Joe Biden's campaign is fledgling in Michigan – which is what this is really about is Joe Biden's weakening campaign – that is threatening not only the national security of Israel, that's threatening our national security in the United States of America. It is unacceptable. It is disgraceful. And we all remember the Democrats’ sham impeachment against President Trump about, quote unquote, ‘withholding Ukrainian aid,’ which by the way that aid was released and sent to Ukraine. Yet here you have a Democrat President in Joe Biden illegally withholding aid that Congress voted on for his political benefits for his campaign because of his issues and because the Democrat Party base is so vehemently antisemitic and anti-Israel. It is a disgrace. We are proud of our strong vote in the House. We will be continuing to show strong leadership on a moral stage and on a national security stage where Chuck Schumer has failed.”

On Joe Biden’s Failed Leadership On the World Stage And the Far Left’s Refusal To Support Israel:

“Well, I believe that they are doing this for political purposes. And you're right. That is the, you describe it as a cynical view, but it's the realistic view. You talk and read in these articles that the White House essentially acknowledges that, maybe not on the record, but it is an acknowledged assumption that that is why they are doing these positions, which is a reflection of today's Democrat party, Guy, about how they have turned their backs on Israel. But at every opportunity to show leadership, Joe Biden has failed. Let's not forget, it's not just in the past two weeks. We saw multiple veto threats when we brought the Israel aid package to the Floor. We saw the encouragement to have Dems vote against when we brought the suspension bill to pass the Israel aid package. You had Chuck Schumer, at the encouragement of Joe Biden and the White House, call for Bibi Netanyahu to be removed, meddling in Israeli elections at a time when they are very unified focusing on prosecuting this war, as you said, for their very existence. So at every opportunity, Joe Biden has failed to lead on the world stage, and the world is watching. And the American people are watching. And there is a reason, as I said, why President Trump continues to do stronger and stronger in the polls, and Joe Biden continues to fail and those polls get more and more abysmal because you compare it to where we were in terms of our national security position on the world stage. You had the Abraham Accords, historic peace breakthroughs in the Middle East. You had an incredibly strong partnership with Israel. You had significant reinvestment in our military capabilities. Our adversaries feared us, and our allies relied on us and we are seeing the exact opposite in Joe Biden's Administration. Let's also add that the Biden Administration continues to be obsessed with appeasing Iran, a continuation of the failed Obama foreign policies, and that's an important part of this as well."

On The House-Wide Investigation Into Colleges And Universities' Failure To Protect Jewish Students:

“Well, Northwestern has been one of the most egregious in terms of their mishandling of, they refuse to combat antisemitism, in the case of Northwestern, and this will come out over the course of the hearing. There have been negotiations with the leadership of Northwestern and the pro-Hamas mob, and they have failed to protect Jewish students on campus. So what it really is, Guy, is we've heard from so many Jewish students’ individual experiences that are absolutely haunting and harrowing that they have faced on these campuses. And unfortunately, the only way we've forced these schools to take action is by holding them accountable hauling them in front of Congress. And I will tell you what we saw from, most recently, the Columbia President hearing is the posture of these university presidents is to just say whatever they have to to get through the hearing, but when we followed up on Columbia, their lip service that they're addressing is not backed up by their failure to act, their failure to protect Jewish students…It got worse, and it came out that what she said in front of Congress was not truthful. When it came to some of the professors who she said were under investigation because of their pro-Hamas statements. It turns out they were not under investigation. So these are major oversight issues of taxpayer dollars on these campuses. And there's an important legal piece which is why you're seeing multiple lawsuits being filed including Northwestern, against Northwestern from Jewish students who have not been protected on campus. So as you know, Guy, I spend a lot of time preparing for these hearings. And they, Northwestern, the other schools that are being hauled in, I will be prepared to hold them accountable for their failures, and it set off a real earthquake. Over the years I've been involved in a lot of high profile hearings. This is more of an earthquake than any other high profile hearing. And it's because of the moral bankruptcy that everyone sees in these university leaders. It’s so far gone that we need to stand up on behalf of the American people and U.S. taxpayers to rein them back in.”

Title: Stefanik Advocates for a Battlefield Heritage Trail in New York State
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanikurgedthe New York State 250th Commemoration Commission to establish a Battlefield Heritage Trail in New York State as part of their efforts to commemorate the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding.

“As Co-Chair of the Congressional Battlefield Caucus, I am proud to lead the charge in Congress to preserve our historic battlefields and ensure Americans across the country can experience and learn about these consequential hallowed grounds in our nation’s history for generations to come,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Upstate New York and the North Country are the cradle of the American Revolution and home to numerous significant battlefields and historic sites including the Battles of Saratoga, Fort Ticonderoga, the Battle of Valcour Island, Fort Ann, Battle of Bennington, Sackets Harbor, Rogers Island, Whitehall, and the Battle of Oriskany.”

In the letter, Stefanik states,“As the Commission begins to develop plans to celebrate the U.S. Semiquincentennial, I strongly urge you to establish a Battlefield Heritage Trail in New York. The creation of this Trail would give our families as well as tourists in our region the opportunity to honor and learn about the sites where Americans gave their last full measure of devotion.”

Stefanik continues,“I urge you to collaborate and engage with stakeholders on the local, state, and federal level as well as leverage public-private partnerships to create rich, educational programming and experiences as a part of the Trail. Tools including signage and interpretive kiosks throughout the Battlefield Heritage Trail will enhance learning and the overall experience for students, families, and visitors. An educational app focused solely on the New York Battlefield Heritage Trail would be beneficial to visitors in acting as a one-stop shop for information such as the inclusion of directions to each stop, a walking audio tour of the various sites, guides for every stop, and 360 virtual tours so that individuals can experience our sacred hallowed grounds from around the world as well.”

As Co-Chair of the Congressional Battlefield Caucus, Stefanik is achampionfor preserving battlefields and historic sites in New York’s 21st Congressional District and beyond. Stefanik’sbill, theAmerican Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act,would make improvements to the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP), one of the most successful land preservation programs managed by the National Park Service.

Title: House GOP Leadership Statement on the Anniversary of the Secure the Border Act Passing the House
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, and Majority Whip Emmer issued the following statement on the anniversary ofH.R. 2, theSecure the Border Act, passing the House of Representatives:

“Over the past three and a half years, President Biden has ceded operational control of the southern border to drug cartels and has welcomed untold millions of inadmissible aliens into our country. Because of Biden‘s policies, traffickers, smugglers, persons on the terrorism watchlist, and other dangerous criminals are now crossing our border every day. Meanwhile, fentanyl poisoning has become a leading cause of death in America, and our own innocent citizens, such as Laken Riley, have been murdered by violent criminals who the Biden Administration released.

“Last year, House Republicans acted to stop the madness by passing the Secure the Border Act, which would increase the number of border patrol agents, resume construction of the border wall, end Biden’s policy of catch-and-release, stop Mayorkas’ abuse of CBP One, and ban taxpayer funds from flowing to NGOs moving illegal aliens around the country.

“For an entire year, Senator Schumer has refused to consider our legislation for a vote, allowing this catastrophe to continue unabated. It is wrong and it is costing American lives every day. On this anniversary, we demand the Senate bring H.R. 2 up for a vote. The American people deserve a government that actually cares about their safety and security, and will uphold the rule of law.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Op-Ed in Watertown Daily Times: Honoring Our Military Moms on Mother’s Day

Watertown Daily Times:Honoring Our Military Moms on Mother’s Day

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

On Mother’s Day, we celebrate the incredible mothers and grandmothers in our district and across America. The dedication of our military mothers is notably unique, often taking them far from their families to serve and protect our nation. The strength of our armed forces hinges not only on the bravery of our service members but also on the resilience of their families who face unique challenges and burdens. As Fort Drum’s chief advocate in Congress, I remain focused on ensuring that our service members and their spouses have access to essential resources such as reliable maternal healthcare.

Every expecting military mother deserves access to the highest quality of care for herself and her baby and an environment where she is safe and comfortable. Yet recently, staffing shortages at Fort Drum’s maternal health clinic led to expectant mothers being referred to off post sites for third trimester care. While our incredible North Country hospitals have stepped up to serve our military families as always, this recent challenge highlights the need to continue to work to improve maternal care in the military.

I recently introduced legislation called the Improving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Act which will address shortfalls in care. This legislation aims to expand access to comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care for service members and their families, ensuring they receive the support they need close to home. As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I'm committed to advancing this legislation through this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

I've been committed to supporting military families throughout my time in Congress by advocating for legislation aimed at enhancing their quality of life. In the FY24 NDAA, I secured the largest pay raise for service members in over 20 years, mandated that the Department of Defense (DoD) explore opportunities for local installations to enhance childcare capacity through partnerships with off-installation childcare providers, directed the DoD to streamline cumbersome regulations on childcare facility employees while maintaining the current standard of care, and authorized the DoD to decrease out-of-pocket childcare expenses for military families.

Representing Fort Drum in Congress is one of my greatest honors, and I will continue to prioritize the military families at Fort Drum and across the armed forces to ensure they are supported. As we celebrate Mother's Day, let's reaffirm our commitment to supporting our military families, recognizing the invaluable contributions of military mothers, and honoring their unwavering strength and resilience.

Washington, D.C.-House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement in response to Joe Biden’s decision to withhold munitions to Israel doubling down on his anti-Israel policies and threatening US national security in the process.

“Joe Biden doubled down on his dangerous anti-Israel policies that put US national security at risk. Biden is undermining Israel by withholding munitions needed to target Hamas. In defiance of Congress, Biden’s decision greenlights Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran to escalate attacks following his failed foreign policy of appeasement. Joe Biden has put the security and very existence of our most precious ally Israel at risk due to his desperate attempt to salvage his plummeting polling. Joe Biden is prioritizing appeasing the pro-Hamas base of the Democrat Party over returning American and Israeli hostages and supporting Israel’s right to exist.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins CBS To Discuss House Investigations Into Antisemitism in K-12 Education
Date: 2024

Washington, D.C. –In case you missed it, House Republican Conference Chairwoman and senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee Elise Stefanik joined CBS’s Nikole Killion to discuss the congressional investigation into the pervasive antisemitism in K-12 education and her questioning of New York City Department of Education Chancellor David Banks.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Investigations into K-12 Schools:

“It's a crisis in some of our public schools as well. You saw the tough questioning I had for the Chancellor of the New York City public school system, where you have antisemitic attacks against teachers, against Jewish students, and a lack of accountability. So it's not just a higher-ed crisis. We are seeing it in K-12 as well. And it's our responsibility as Members of Congress, we need to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars to hold these institutions accountable when there's a failure of leadership. Now, I'll tell you the hearings are important because they do deliver accountability where it has been slow walked by their elected officials, like in the case of the Mayor of D.C., where it took the night before the hearing for them to clear out a pro-Hamas encampment at GW. So the hearings matter in terms of accountability.”

On Congressional Hearings to Hold University Presidents and Elected Officials Accountable:

“There are going to continue to be hearings on a lot of this crisis. The next group of schools we have coming in are Northwestern, UCLA, and Michigan where there's been a failure of leadership. But it shouldn't take a Congressional hearing for elected officials, the D.C. Mayor, or university presidents to do the right thing to ensure safety and security for students, particularly for Jewish students who have been under attack, to condemn antisemitism. But if it takes a Congressional hearing, we'll continue to hold them accountable because that's a specific result we've been able to deliver.”

On Holding K-12 School Principals Accountable for Antisemitism:

“You know, I think, in the case of where there is a failure of the principals to deliver accountability, there needs to be, not just a shifting them to another part of the Department of Education, they need to be fired. They, again, are paid for by taxpayer dollars in the state of New York and in the city of New York in this case. So it's not just enough to move them to another entity. They need to be fired, and that was not done in this case.”

Title: Stefanik’s Advocacy Leads to Biden Administration Revoking Communist Chinese Huawei’s Export Licenses
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced that following her advocacy the Biden Administration revoked export licenses that allowed American company Intel to supply Communist Chinese spy company Huawei with semiconductors. This action will disrupt the supply of U.S. technology for Huawei’s laptop computers and mobile phones.

“Following my oversight, the Department of Commerce has finally responded to Congressional Republicans' repeated demands to revoke export licenses for any U.S. company that exports to known Communist Chinese spy company, Huawei. This action will bolster U.S. national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China’s ability to advance its technology. However, our work is far from finished,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I will continue to conduct critical oversight to ensure that the Bureau of Industry and Security takes its role as a national security agency seriously by adding more companies to the entity list and revoking additional licenses if needed. We cannot provide Communist China with any technology developed in the U.S. that would give them an advantage.”

Last month, Congresswoman Stefanik led aletterto Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging the Biden Administration to immediately revoke all export licenses to Communist Chinese spy company Huawei after Huawei announced that it will be using new technology developed by American company Intel in their latest computers.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions NYC Education Chancellor on Failure to Properly Address Antisemitism in NYC Schools
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, questioned New York City Department of Education Chancellor David Banks on his failure to adequately respond to instances of antisemitism in New York City schools.

Stefanik also questioned Chancellor Banks on failing to fire the principal of Hillcrest High School after a teacher was attacked for being Jewish and openly supporting Israel.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Banks, there’s been many questions on Hillcrest. And I just want to make sure it’s very clear for the record: The principal of Hillcrest High School is still employed by the Department of Education, correct?

Chancellor Banks:Correct.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And what is his role?

Chancellor Banks:He’s serving in a role working on one of the teams under one of our deputy chancellors.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I am told that he’s Director of Teacher Development and Evaluation. Is that accurate?

Chancellor Banks:I don’t know his official title, right now. I’d have to double check that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:That’s concerning to me that you have him in a senior position, and what’s very concerning about these hearings is that we’re getting lip service but a lack of enforcement, a lack of accountability. And these rules and policies matter whether it’s teachers, administrators, or students violating the rules. I want to switch to Origins High School. In October, 40 to 50 students marched through Origins High School chanting ‘Death to Israel’ and ‘Kill the Jews.’ In addition, an independent investigation found that a teacher, who teaches global history, was told by a student, “I wish you were killed.” Another student called her “a dirty Jew,” and the student said he wished Hitler could have hit more Jews including her. What disciplinary actions have been taken against those students who chanted ‘Death to Israel’ at Origins High School and against the student who harassed, with antisemitic slurs, that teacher?

Chancellor Banks:Two things: First of all, when we’ve done our investigation we have found no evidence that there was any movement through the halls saying ‘Death to the Jews.’ And I treat that very, very seriously. That was reported in the papers. We have found no evidence that that actually happened. What we have found are a wide range of deeply troubling, antisemitic things that have happened at Origins High School. This is the one case that has troubled me the most, Congresswoman, I will tell you that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So, what are the enforcement actions?

Chancellor Banks:I’m trying to tell you. We have, in fact, suspended a number of students at that school, but currently, this case now is under litigation. And I’m being advised not to speak to the specific things that have happened there, but just know that I have visited that school after these allegations have come up. I’ve met with parents, families, staff, students. I’m deeply troubled by what is happening there, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it. I can’t say more because this is now under litigation.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You understand our concern though as policy makers. When we have witnesses testify whether it’s Columbia University, Penn, Harvard, or New York City Chancellor, when there’s a lack of enforcement and accountability, that there is a set of rules but that individuals who violate those rules are not held accountable.

Chancellor Banks:We’ve held a lot of people accountable. You weren’t here when I gave my opening statement.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you didn’t. You said you fired the principal, and it turns out the former principal of Hillcrest–

Chancellor Banks:I never said I fired the principal.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You did. You can check the testimony. Ms. McClain asked. You said ‘yes.’

Chancellor Banks:Fired the principal of who?

Congresswoman Stefanik:Hillcrest.

Chancellor Banks:I never said I fired the principal of Hillcrest. You check the record. I never said that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I will check the record. I will check the record.

Chancellor Banks:I said that we removed the principal. I never said I fired the principal.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Banks. She said, ‘has he been fired?’ You said ‘yes.’ And then we moved on.

Chancellor Banks:I did not say that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You did. You said he was removed.

Chancellor Banks:Well,I would beg to differ on that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:We now know though that he is still employed by the Department of Education.

Chancellor Banks:He is no longer at the school.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But he is employed by the Department of Education.

Chancellor Banks:He has been removed from his position as the principal of the school. That’s not the same thing as terminated.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And now he is employed at the Department of Education. You testified to that. And you also said, I believe, we’ve been told that he’s Director of Teacher Development and Evaluation, and you’re not sure if that’s the case. Our expectation is that we’ll get an answer by the end of today whether that’s the case or not.

Chancellor Banks:You will, absolutely.

Congresswoman Stefanik:My next question is: There have been multiple teacher-led, anti-Israel walkouts during school time. What are the consequences for those teacher walkouts? And do those violate policy of DOE?

Chancellor Banks:I’m not sure what teacher walkouts. We’ve had a number of walkouts of students out of school, including several of our high schools. Which are also very troubling for me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So what disciplinary action is taken in that case?

Chancellor Banks:Right, the challenge that we have in that case is we do not have any rules within our code of conduct that would prevent a child from actually walking out of the school. When they walk out of the school, they are marked absent. They’re essentially cutting from school. There are consequences for cutting school. We notify parents.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It’s your testimony here today that there’s no teacher involvement in those walkouts? Because independent media reports say that there is teacher involvement in those walkouts.

Chancellor Banks:I don’t have any evidence of that. We have evidence of one where the principal assigned a teacher to go with a student to a protest. Completely inappropriate. That principle was disciplined. The teacher was disciplined in that particular case.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What was the form of the discipline?

Chancellor Banks:I’m not at liberty to tell you the very specific. They were not fired, but we have a wide range of discipline that takes place in those cases. And we did take action.

Congresswoman Stefanik:My last question is: You had a teacher at Gotham Tech High School in Queens, and you’ve spoken out publicly against this, he posted images of a Hamas paraglider to his social media, repeatedly refers to ‘so-called Israel.’ Again, this is highlighting a Hamas paraglider who slaughtered Jews, we all have seen the horrific footage, who cooked babies. These are terrorists. What disciplinary action has been taken against this teacher?

Chancellor Banks:Again, action was taken. First of all, I want just to say I think what that employee did was absolutely disgusting, absolutely disgusting.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But what action?

Chancellor Banks:And we took action.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What was the action?

Chancellor Banks:I cannot give you specifics on the action that was taken.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Yes you can. You are in front of Congress. What is the action?

Chancellor Banks:I cannot give you, on this specific employee, we did in fact take action.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You can give us an answer. You’re choosing not to. That’s unacceptable.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox Business To Discuss House Republicans’ Commitment To Israel Amidst Joe Biden’s Failed Leadership
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow to discuss Joe Biden’s failed leadership as he continues to turn his back on our most precious ally Israel in favor of appeasing the pro-Hamas wing of his Democrat Party. Stefanik reiterated that House Republicans will always support our most precious ally abroad while combating the rampant antisemitism at home.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Joe Biden’s Failure To Stand With Israel:

“My take is that at every opportunity Joe Biden has failed to show important support for Israel, and we see that playing out today as they’re limiting and withholding the military aid package that Congress passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. The fact that they are tying Israel’s hands when Israel is in a fight for its very existence. And let’s take a step back, Larry. This is our most precious ally in the region who faced the bloodiest day since the Holocaust when a terrorist group, Hamas, committed barbaric atrocities against innocent Israelis. So we need to ensure that Israel has all tools available. That is what Congress voted for, and it’s a disgrace that Joe Biden is withholding those. When it comes to Joe Biden’s silence, it took him months to speak out and condemn the antisemitism on college campuses. He failed to hold the university presidents accountable. And then, yet tried to give it lip service yesterday at a memorial service. That is not good enough. That is not the type of moral, strong leadership that the world and Israel and the American people are expecting from the President of the United States.”

On House Republicans’ Commitment To Our Ally Israel:

“Well, I’ll tell you, House Republicans are very clear. We stand in strong support of Israel. We brought that aid package to Israel to the Floor multiple times, and the Democrat Party has fractured. And we know, it’s being exposed for the world to see, that the pro-Hamas encampments, the pro-Hamas arm of the Democrat Party is now mainstream in Joe Biden’s party. And we have not seen Joe Biden’s support for Israel. If anything, they have been apologists for Hamas. And we need to be very clear, and we are very clear. And I was particularly moved when Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke at Yad Vashem, and said, ‘If Israel stands alone, they will stand alone.’ That should never be the case. The United States should be the closest ally with Israel as they are fighting for their very existence. Certainly, that’s my position in terms of my voting record and how I have spoken out on this issue. And we are not seeing that from Joe Biden nor the Biden Administration.”

On Holding the Biden Administration Accountable for Antisemitism:

“You are absolutely right, Larry. That’s why we wrote the letter in our capacity of having oversight. And when you have an individual at a senior level in Biden’s Department of Justice who has a history of supporting antisemitism, and yet that’s the very position that is supposed to be protecting Jewish students and ensuring that there are Title VI protections, that is unacceptable. They need to be removed from that position. And I’ll tell you what, Larry, also let’s remember, these Title VI protections, which were expanded to include Jewish students, that was a President Trump Executive Order. And the Biden Administration has failed to launch investigations from the Department of Education for the failure to ensure safety and security for Jewish students on these college campuses. So you have college after college, who is not complying with Title VI requirements, and yet you have an Administration who fails to hold them to account. That’s why these Congressional hearings are so incredibly important. And when it comes to your earlier questions about the overall support for Israel, let’s go back to the Trump Administration where we had the historic breakthroughs of the Abraham Accords and just the stalwart support for Israel. You had peace in the Middle East. Compare that to the weak, abject failure foreign policy of Joe Biden. That’s why this choice is on the ballot this November, and it’s why President Trump continues to poll stronger and stronger and will defeat Joe Biden.”

On Americans Not Supporting Biden’s Pro-Hamas Democrat Party:

“Well, you’re right, Larry, and that’s why Joe Biden is attempting to appease the growing, pro-Hamas part of the Democrat Party which is now mainstream. Much of this funding that goes to Democrat groups is also going to these pro-Hamas, pro-terrorist encampments on university campuses. So, Joe Biden has a real political problem as to what his party has become, which is they’ve turned their back on Israel, and they are apologists. And frankly, they publicly support the Hamas terrorist attacks and the atrocities. That is out of touch with hard-working Americans. That’s out of touch with, as you said, the vast majority of the American people. And again, it’s one of the reasons why, as we head to the polls this November, President Trump and Republican support continues to make significant inroads and is pulling ahead in every single swing state.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox & Friends to Discuss Joe Biden Withholding Aid To Our Most Precious Ally Israel & House Republicans' Fight Against Antisemitism
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’Fox & Friendsto discuss Joe Biden’s decision to withhold military aid from our most precious ally Israel while they fight for their very existence.

Stefanik also highlighted House Republicans' fight to combat antisemitism in America’s education system and the Biden Administration’s failure to confront this vial rot.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Joe Biden Withholding Aid To Our Most Precious Ally Israel:

“It’s absurd, Brian, and it’s just another example where President Joe Biden has failed to support our most precious ally Israel. Congress passed supplemental funding and military aid to Israel. And it is outrageous and is not complying with congressional intent the fact that the Biden Administration is holding these back. This is, as Israel is, you know, suffered its bloodiest day since the Holocaust with the terrorist attack on October 7th. They're fighting for their very existence. So House Republicans are pushing back both in our oversight capacity as well as conversations between the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States about how this is absolutely unacceptable.”

On Biden And Far Left Democrats’ Failure To Support Israel:

“Correct and it just goes to show that the Biden Administration and Joe Biden himself have failed to support Israel. They're more concerned about their pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party which we're seeing is part of the radicalized Left. And it's a stark contrast with Republicans who strongly support Israel, and we are going to continue to take that stance. We, again remember, brought that Israel aid package to the floor multiple times as the Democrats support cratered. So this is one of the reasons why President Trump continues to poll stronger and stronger because Joe Biden exudes weakness on the world stage, and he's turning his back on our most important ally in the region Israel.”

On The Necessity To Stand With Israel:

“It should be the objective, Brian, but, you know, this Administration, whether it's from the press podium at the White House or the President himself, they have failed to explicitly condemn Hamas. They have failed to call out the fact that Hamas uses civilian shields, and it's a way of their terrorist tactics. That's why they need to be defeated. That's why it's important for us as the United States to stand with Israel. And it was a very solemn moment this past weekend when you heard at the Holocaust Remembrance Ceremony at Yad Vashem, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, ‘If Israel has to stand alone, they will.’ As the United States of America, we should never allow Israel to stand alone. America must stand with Israel.”

On U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona’s Testimony & House Republicans Fight Against Antisemitism:

“No, it's not a good enough answer, but great question by Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, Chair of the Education Committee. And it just shows that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being abused to prop up not only these institutions, but paying student loans of these pro-Hamas terrorists. And we should not forgive those student loans. We need to defund these universities that are apologists for pro-Hamas, that support these pro-terrorist professors and turn a blind eye to these terrorist antisemitic students, some of whom are on student visas. Those visas need to be revoked. That is why we've expanded our House investigation. So it's going after the appropriations, that would be the funding, going after the visas for the student visas, revoking those immediately, going after the tax exempt status of these universities. This is a failure of moral leadership, a failure of moral clarity, and we will continue to lead, to call this out, and hold these schools accountable, which is why this week, for example, we have two very important hearings. One will have the D.C. Mayor, Mayor Bowser, for the failure of her allowing, she didn't allow the law enforcement to clear the encampment until last night at GW in preparation for the hearing today.”

…

“That shows the importance of these congressional hearings because they will not do the right thing until we hold them accountable.”

Title: Stefanik, Roy Introduce The Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act Sanctioning The ICC For Prosecuting Israel And Other American Allies
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.–Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX) in introducing theIllegitimate Court Counteraction Actto sanction International Criminal Court (ICC) officials who investigate or prosecute the United States and its allies, including Israel who does not recognize the ICC’s authority. This comes after reports that the ICC plans to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and other senior officials of the Israel Defence Forces.

This bill would sanction and revoke the visas of any ICC employee or associate that is involved in investigating, prosecuting, or assisting in the investigation or prosecution of current or former U.S. soldiers or officials or the current or former officials or troops of any ally of the United States which does not recognize the authority of the ICC. Additionally, it revokes the visas of all ICC employees, all persons acting on behalf of the ICC, and the immediate family members of those sanctioned for investigating U.S. and allied troops and officials.

“The International Criminal Court’s threats to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netannyahu and other Israeli Defense officials expose a campaign to undermine the only democracy in the Middle East, while turning a blind eye to the numerous human right atrocities committed by Hamas,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This double standard is an abuse of power by the ICC and exposes their irrelevance. I am proud to support the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act that will put guardrails in place to protect Israel and our allies from baseless attacks from the ICC. The ICC is on notice, if they move forward with these illegitimate warrants, the international bureaucrats involved will face consequences.”

“The ICC is an illegitimate court that represents a massive threat to US sovereignty. The Trump administration was right to impose sanctions on the associates of the ICC if they dare go after US citizens, servicemembers, or our allies; Biden's decision to reverse that policy was weak, embarrassing, and wrong. Now reports indicate the ICC is poised to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and other high-ranking Israeli officials. America's policy should be unquestionably clear: if the ICC goes after our allies, there will be consequences. I am proud to lead the effort with Rep. Mast and others to correct Biden’s error and reimpose sanctions on associates of the ICC,”said Congressman Chip Roy.

Stefanik has consistently held the ICC accountable and warned they would face consequences if they issue arrest warrants. In April 2024, Stefanik co-led aletterwith Representatives D’Esposito (R-NY) and Molinaro (R-NY) demanding Joe Biden and Secretary Blinken strongly support Israel and oppose efforts by the ICC to issue warrants against key Israeli leadership and defense officials.

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: Instead of Protecting Jewish Students, Joe Biden Has Pandered to the Pro-Hamas Wing of the Democrat Party
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how Joe Biden, Far Left Democrats, and university leadership have failed to protect Jewish students electing to pander to the pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party.

Stefanik also reiterated that House Republicans will use every tool at their disposal to protect Jewish students and end this scourge of antisemitism that is destroying American education.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the transcript of her remarks below:

“Under the failed Far Left Democrat leadership of Joe Biden, our country is unrecognizable, and the American people know it. Once acclaimed colleges and universities have turned into chaos, fallen to brainwashed, antisemitic groupthink, canceling commencements.

Instead of protecting Jewish students, Joe Biden has pandered to the pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party. And campus leadership has shamefully followed suit, negotiating with these pro-Hamas terrorists and submitting to their demands following Joe Biden's pattern of appeasement. These apologists for the antisemitic mob have turned the Democrat Party into the party of Pro-Hamas – a party that defends calls for “Death to America” heard across American campuses.

As we laid out last week, House Republicans, under the leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson, are taking action.As part of this Conference-wide investigation, we have two major hearings this week. The Oversight Committee is bringing Mayor Bowser and D.C. Chief of Police before Congress for answers regarding the antisemitic mob at GW’s campus, and the Education and the Workforce Committee will address antisemitism in K-12 schools. These schools must be held accountable. House Republicans will use every tool available to end this scourge of antisemitism that is destroying American education.

Shifting to the House Floor this week, House Republicans are continuing to lead and deliver for the American people bringing legislation which protects America’s consumers’ rights from their right to choose their home appliances to combatting the SEC’s burdensome regulations on crypto.

We are joined today by our colleague and friend Debbie Lesko to discuss her bill, the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act, which protects Americans from Joe Biden’s failed Far Left anti-American energy agenda.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Holding American Universities Accountable For Rampant Antisemitism & Joe Biden’s Judicial Lawfare Against President Trump
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo onSunday Morning Futuresto discuss holding American universities accountable for enabling rampant antisemitism and Joe Biden’s unconstitutional judicial lawfare against President Donald Trump.

Watch her full interview here.

Read highlights from her interview below.

On The Rise of Antisemitism in Higher Education And The Need to Protect Jewish Students:

“Well, first of all Maria, this is a crisis in higher education, and I want to thank our law enforcement officers. You played the clip of the NYPD, but who has failed are the university presidents. Our law enforcement have done the right thing bringing security back to these college campuses. But our university presidents, whether it's Columbia, whether it's Harvard, Penn, whether it's UCLA, Michigan, Yale, the list goes on, they have failed to protect Jewish students. They have also failed to condemn antisemitism. And let's be honest, these pro-Hamas riots, this is Joe Biden's Democrat Party. Joe Biden, not only waited 10 days to condemn, he has been silent since last December with that historic hearing where you had three Ivy League university presidents fail to condemn the genocide of Jews. Joe Biden waited months to speak out saying that testimony was unacceptable. He didn't even say that actually, in his statement, but he gave it lip service. But this is the radicalized Far Left Democrat party that Joe Biden owns today. It is about lawlessness. It is about anarchy. It is attacking our most precious ally, Israel, and it is hurling antisemitic slurs against Jewish students as well as physical harassment, physical assault against Jewish students. So there is a great deal that we are doing in Congress in our oversight, and our legislative solutions will consist of pulling back federal funding, addressing the foreign dollars that are flowing into these institutions, and holding these schools accountable.”

On Joe Biden’s Deafening Silence To Speak Out Against The Antisemtic Mobs On College Campuses:

“Exactly. This is Joe Biden's Democrat party today. The pro-Hamas rioters on college campuses, the anarchists and that's why you're seeing trepidation among Democrats from speaking out because this is their base. And the reality is this is why Republicans continue to poll stronger and stronger because we represent peace and security. We represent standing up for the Constitution. We represent supporting our ally of Israel, and we strongly condemn antisemitism. There is a reason that House Republicans have led on this and it's because there has been a void at our universities. There was a void at the White House starting with the top of Joe Biden. And there's been a void in Democrat leadership, including Chuck Schumer, which is why we have expanded the investigation and will continue to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars to yank federal funding that is propping up these institutions that are indoctrinating our next generation.”

On Who Is Funding The Antisemitic Mob Terrorizing American Campuses:

“These are really important questions, Maria. So this is a well organized entity of Far Left Democrat radical groups domestically. It is well funded, well organized. But in addition, there is a foreign funding piece that is very important that we get to the bottom of whether it's the foreign funding flowing into these Middle Eastern Studies programs at these universities propping up antisemitic professors as well as propagating antisemitic curriculum. We need to not allow that foreign funding, and that is going to be an important legislative solution. In addition, any individuals who are part of these pro-Hamas riots or pro-Hamas encampments who are on student visas, those visas need to be revoked and those individuals need to be deported immediately. And in the case of Colombia, we found from NYPD that over 40 percent of the rioters were unaffiliated with Columbia University, meaning they were neither students, professors, or faculty members. And that just shows the failure of Columbia leadership to deal with this. They have allowed these outside rioters, these outside Far Left Democrat, pro-Hamas activists to take over their campuses putting all students at risk, especially Jewish students. So this is why I've called for the resignation of the Columbia President Minouche Shafik. She negotiated with the terrorists and that was a recipe for disaster.”

On Joe Biden’s Witch Hunt Against President Trump:

“This is a political witch hunt against Joe Biden's opponent who is Donald Trump and it's because Democrats cannot win at the ballot box. The fact that they have a gag order on President Trump in the midst of a general election campaign shows how desperate the Democrats are. You have a corrupt judge in Judge Merchan. Not only did he donate personally to the Biden campaign, but an immediate member of his family is raising 10s of millions of dollars off of the trial itself and attacking Donald Trump. This is the chief online fundraiser for Adam Schiff to the tune of nearly $90 million, Maria. So this is corrupt to its core. And yet this is and the left and the corrupt DOJ, this is apparently what they're doing with lawfare and we need to stand strong and make sure that this never happens again. When it comes to the star witness for this political witch hunt, this is an individual who perjured himself in front of Congress, who is a known liar, and I urge the Department of Justice to continue the criminal contempt against Michael Cohen. But there is no case here. It is desperation and it's a desperate form of election interference.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox News to Discuss The House Republicans’ Probe Into Antisemitism on College Campuses
Date: 2024

Content:
Palm Beach, FL —House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’ Kayleigh McEnany to discuss the House-wide probe into campus antisemitism which will not stop until Jewish students can feel safe on campus and the leadership of these universities are held accountable for failing to protect Jewish students.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On House Republicans Probe into Antisemitic Mobs on University Campuses:

“Absolutely, and that’s going to be part of this House Republican wide probe, Kayleigh. That’s why it’s so important that we’ve expanded this investigation because it’s not just oversight of U.S. taxpayer dollars to these institutions. It’s student visas for foreign students who are harassing Jewish students, who are attacking Jewish students on campus. The outside agitators piece, absolutely, we need to work with our law enforcement to get to the bottom of it. And we are committed to doing so. Take Columbia: NYPD put out data that over 40 percent of the individuals were outside and unaffiliated with Columbia. Now, you still have Columbia professors and Columbia students, and they need to be expelled. But that’s why these investigations are so important. And as we saw, the hearing where my questions went viral, and the answers, the morally bankrupt answers from the presidents of Penn and Harvard that set off a real crisis across higher education that has been brewing for a very long time. And it’s House Republicans that are going to lead to protect Jewish students and specifically condemn antisemitism and get rid of this woke radicalization. And you know who has been so silent? Joe Biden.”

On Columbia University President Shafik Lying to Congress:

“What’s worse, Kayleigh, is that she testified that he was under investigation. There were two professors that are pro-Hamas professors that I asked about and she said that both were under investigation. It turns out that those professors then said to the New York Times, the day after the hearing, that there was no investigation, that they were not removed from the classroom, that they were not removed as academic chairs. So this is a real legal issue for Minouche Shafik who is president of Columbia. You can’t lie to Congress. That’s a federal offense and that’s why the document requests are so incredibly important to make sure we subpoena all the documents and lack thereof if there were no investigations which we now know there were not. So there was a lot more here. I think the Columbia strategy was to say whatever they had to say in the hearing to try to avoid the fate of presidents–former presidents–of Penn and Harvard. But the problem with that, Kayleigh, is there was no action to back it up. Columbia had not taken adequate action to hold those pro-Hamas professors accountable by suspending them and expelling them from campus, to hold the students accountable by expelling them from campus, and to protect Jewish students. They failed on all those counts.”

On Calling for Columbia University President Shafik’s Resignation:

“Of course. I was the first Member to call for her resignation. It’s clear that it’s out of control at Columbia. Just look at the fact that they are negotiating. She negotiated. She set these deadlines for when the pro-Hamas encampment needed to leave, and then she allowed these agitators to go beyond that deadline. There has been no enforcement. And what’s most important here is Jewish students have not been protected on Columbia’s campus, and it is required by Title VI, the Executive Order that you remember that President Trump put into place that protects Jewish students. They have failed at Columbia to follow the law, and Joe Biden’s Department of Education has failed to hold them accountable. That’s why it’s been so incredibly important that House Republicans have stepped in in our oversight capacity as good stewards of taxpayer dollars but also making sure that we are reining in these out of control, woke higher-ed institutions. And I will continue to lead this fight.”

Fox News:As a House Republican leader, here’s our message on chaos, antisemitism for university presidents

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

Americans are watching in disgust as chaos spreads at college campuses across our country. Jewish students and faculty fear for their safety as antisemitism goes unchecked, and the rule of law is abandoned by morally bankrupt university leaders taking their lead from President Joe Biden.

Enough is enough. It is time to restore law, order, and moral decency to Columbia and universities across this country.

Speaker Johnson and House Republicans announced our plans to hold our higher education institutions accountable for their failure to protect Jewish students and condemn antisemitism. Billions of taxpayer dollars flow to these institutions in the form of federal student aid, research grants, and favorable tax treatment. To university presidents and administrators, our message is clear -- if you cannot keep your students safe, you will be held accountable.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) had to restore order on Columbia University’s campus Tuesday night after the preventable chaos that engulfed the university campus for weeks escalated to a new level when Hamilton Hall was stormed, defaced, and taken over by a pro-Hamas mob. Facility workers were held inside and the building was barricaded as these terrorist sympathizers hung a banner with a call for "intifada" outside the windows.

It’s not just Columbia. This is a moral rot that has taken root across American higher education institutions.

At Harvard University, a Palestinianflag was hoisted at University Hall where the American flag flies.

Jewish students were barricaded in the library at Cooper Union.

The University of Southern California canceled graduation due to the university being unable to guarantee the safety of students.

At Yale University, a Jewish student wasstabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag at a demonstration.

A woman was reportedly beaten unconscious by a pro-Palestinian mob at the University of California, Los Angeles for being Jewish.

Dozens of these occupations are happening around the country, often in a manner that breaks university rules and leads to increased targeting and harassment of Jewish students and faculty.

In December,I exposed just how ingrained antisemitism has become at America’s so-called "elite" institutions of higher education when I questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn in what has become the most-viewed congressional testimony in history. Those three university presidents could not answer the simple question, "does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct?"

On April 17th, Columbia University’s President Shafikand board members epitomized the failed leadership in another congressional hearing when they could not account for Columbia’s lack of response to antisemitism and anarchy on campus. Eight days ago, I was the first Member of Congress to demand President Shafik resign for her failure to disband the antisemitic mob consuming Columbia’s campus and ensure the safety of Columbia’s Jewish students. She instead negotiated with these self-proclaimed terrorists, allowing their antisemitic mob to grow.

There can be NO moral equivalency. It is time to send a clear message to the world that antisemitism has no place in America.

The world is watching. And House Republicans are leading where university presidents, far-left Democrats, and Joe Biden have failed.

Title: Stefanik Votes to Pass Antisemitism Awareness Act
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted in favor of the bipartisanAntisemitism Awareness Actto require the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s working definition of antisemitism and its contemporary examples when enforcing anti-discrimination laws.

“I’m proud to support this important legislation that will protect our brave Jewish students who are watching their campuses be taken over by unsanctioned mobs of antisemites by requiring the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition of antisemitism when enforcing anti-discrimination laws. This bipartisan bill based on a Trump-era Executive Order will force the failed leadership of universities, like Columbia and Harvard, to finally crack down on antisemitic violence and harassment against Jewish students and community members on their campuses,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes modern manifestations of antisemitism like justifying the killing of Jews and holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

In December 2019, President Donald Trump signed anExecutive Orderasking federal agencies to expand the interpretation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism.

Title: Stefanik Cosponsors Resolution to Overturn EPA’s Tailpipe Emission Rule
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik cosponsored a resolution to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) tailpipe emission rule entitled “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles.” This Congressional Review Act (CRA) led by Congressman John James (R-MI) would overturn the Biden Administration's decision to phase out gas-powered vehicles. The EPA projects this rule will require 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales be electric vehicles by 2032.

“The Biden Administration’s attempt to push their failed Far Left climate agenda on hardworking American families is dangerous and unAmerican. I’m proud to stand up for consumer choice and cosponsor a resolution to overturn Biden’s senseless rule to set radical emission standards on auto manufacturers,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Electric vehicles are not a feasible option in many parts of the country including in my rural district of Upstate New York and the North Country. We must combat Democrats’ failed Far Left anti-American energy policies that threaten to bankrupt and burden American families.”

Title: Stefanik Urges Trustees of Columbia University to Remove President Shafik
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto Trustees of Columbia University Co-Chairs David Greenwald and Claire Shipman urging them to act immediately to remove President Minouche Shafik from her position and quickly secure student, faculty, and staff safety after a mob of antisemites overtook a university building.

In the letter, Stefanik states,“After midnight on April 30, 2024, the preventable chaos that has engulfed Columbia University’s campus for weeks escalated to a new level, and Hamilton Hall was stormed, defaced, and taken over by a pro-Hamas mob. [1] These actions, as well as the illegal encampment and violent riots, go far beyond any right to free speech protected under the First Amendment. This pro-Hamas mob held facilities workers hostage, [2] barricaded the building, and issued demands of the university. [3] As of this morning, the building remains occupied. This violence is a direct result of the appeasement policies President Minouche Shafik has used to address antisemitism on campus. President Shafik has allowed campus to be taken by mob rule, and she must immediately be removed so this occupation can be met with swift and overwhelming response to retake campus, restore order, and protect Jewish students.”

Stefanik continues,“This is a dereliction of duty. President Shafik has bent over backwards to appease antisemitic radicals and agitators who have sown chaos. By enabling this to happen, President Shafik is first and foremost violating the rights of Jewish students and faculty, but also creating an environment that is unsafe for all on campus.”

Title: Stefanik, Turner Demand DOJ Investigate Cohen For Making False Statements To Congress
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) to Attorney General Merrick Garland following up on acriminal referralsent to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in November demanding the DOJ launch a criminal investigation into whether Michael D. Cohen committed perjury and knowingly making false statements while testifying under oath during his deposition before Congress on February 28, 2019.

“The Biden Administration’s attempts to stonewall this investigation is yet another example of Biden’s lawfare against President Trump,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“It’s time Joe Biden stop weaponizing the federal government against his leading political opponent."

“Michael Cohen has no credibility. He is an admitted liar,”said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner.

The lawmakers state,“To date, we received no response from the Biden Justice Department regarding this criminal referral. This is unacceptable. The Biden Justice Department eagerly prosecuted two different former Trump senior presidential advisors—Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro—for contesting the lawfulness of a subpoena. In fact, the Biden Justice Department brought the first contempt-of-Congress prosecutions seen in nearly forty years. Perjury and false statements before Congress are crimes that undermine the integrity of the constitutional duty to conduct oversight and inquiries—far more so than contesting the lawfulness of a subpoena. Yet, despite an admission from Mr. Cohen that he lied under oath to Congress, the Biden Justice Department did nothing.”

The lawmakers continued,“The double standard is glaring. The obvious implication is that you have politicized and weaponized the Biden Justice Department to help your boss and hurt his political enemy. You are trying to protect the reputation of an admitted perjurer, one who just so happens to be set to testify against former President Trump in New York.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Fox News To Discuss Efforts To Protect Jewish Students At Columbia & Hold University Leaders Accountable For Enabling The Pro-Hamas Antisemitic Mob

Washington, D.C. –Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’ Martha MacCallum to discuss the pro-Hamas, antisemitic mob that took over an academic building at Columbia last night. Stefanik reiterated her commitment to protect Jewish students and hold these colleges and universities accountable for fostering an environment that allowed antisemitism to grow.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On The Morally Bankrupt Testimony of University Presidents:

“The hope in those hearings was to highlight the importance of our universities to protect Jewish students and to strongly and clearly condemn antisemitism. We have seen the exact opposite in the case of both Harvard and Penn while their university presidents were forced out because of their morally bankrupt answers to my question in that historic hearing. We have not seen those schools step up to protect Jewish students. Then, of course, we have the Columbia University hearing with President Shafik where clearly their strategy was: Say whatever you have to get through the hearing to try to avoid the fate of the Penn and Harvard President, but yet, they weren't taking actions any action on campus to protect Jewish Students, to address the rise of antisemitism. And now you see President Shafik just failing instead of standing up for safety and security on campus. Instead of showing moral leadership, they have allowed the pro-Hamas mob to violently take over the historic Hamilton hall named after Alexander Hamilton. So our schools are in a crisis across America, not just at the elite schools, but you're seeing at higher ed institutions across America, which is why House Republicans, under Speaker Johnson's leadership, have announced a congressional wide investigation and probe on this, looking at federal dollars, looking at the foreign student visa, looking at foreign funding, making sure that we're standing up for U.S. taxpayers who fund many of these institutions. There is so much work to do, Martha.”

On If Student Protestors Attending College On A Student Visa Should Be Deported:

“Yes, absolutely. They should be deported. Just take a step back, Martha. These are, I don't call them protesters, they are pro-Hamas members of a mob who are calling for the eradication of Israel. They are calling for genocide against Jews, around the world, and in America. It is unthinkable that we are allowing this to happen at U.S. universities. We're supposed to be the moral leader, and our university presidents have absolutely failed. And you know who else has failed? The professors who instead of standing up for academic integrity and moral leadership are supporting these university presidents who become apologists for this antisemitic, not only verbal harassment, but behavior. So yes, they absolutely should be deported.”

On Universities Failing To Support Jewish Students:

“People around the world are watching. There is a reason why the testimony of the Harvard, Penn, and MIT Presidents was the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress with over one billion views in a week. And that wasn't just views within America. That was views around the world. So these universities need to step up, and they are failing to do so. So Congress is going to step in because remember, Martha, billions of dollars of hard earned taxpayer dollars go to support these universities, and American taxpayers don't want to support antisemitism. They oppose antisemitism. And we know that we're going to continue to stand up for what's morally right. And the other double standard that we're seeing for these universities, in the case of Columbia, Harvard, Penn, they ranked the lowest of the low when it comes to standing up for freedom of speech. They only vociferously defend freedom of speech when it comes to calling for the genocide of Jews. And that hypocrisy has been so clear.”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: It Is Time To Restore Law And Order, Academic Integrity, And Moral Decency To America’s Higher Education Institutions
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight their efforts to ensure the safety of Jewish students and community members at America’s universities and crack down on the antisemitic mobs that have overrun several campuses.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the transcript of her remarks below:

“I want to thank the Speaker as well Chairwoman Foxx for visiting Columbia University’s campus last week to highlight moral leadership that is sorely needed and lacking when it comes to these university presidents. I also want to thank the Speaker for making this a priority for all of House Republicans. It is clear that Jewish families across this country, Americans across this country, are looking for moral clarity, and we are going to deliver where these higher education institutions have failed.

As the Speaker said last night at Columbia, America watched in disgust as President Shafik allowed an antisemitic, pro-terrorist mob to storm and seize an academic building holding faculty inside, flying pro-Hamas signs, and damaging property. Joe Biden, Far Left Democrat governors, like my homestate in New York, and morally bankrupt university leaders have allowed this moral rot of antisemitism to fester, refusing to enforce the laws and refusing to ensure the safety of Jewish students.

And it’s not just Columbia. This is a moral rot that has taken root across American higher education institutions. At Yale University, a Jewish student was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. At the University of Southern California, graduation was canceled due to the university being unable to guarantee the safety of students. Jewish students were barricaded in the library at Cooper Union. At my alma-mater, Harvard University, a Palestinian flag was hoisted at University Hall where the American flag always flies in clear violation of university policies.

There are dozens of these antisemitic encampments across the country. These mobs are breaking university rules leading to the targeting and harassment of Jewish students and faculty.

In December, at a hearing chaired by our Education and Workforce Chairwoman Viriginia Foxx, we exposed just how ingrained antisemitism has become at America’s so-called “elite” institutions and higher education. When I questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and Penn ‘Does calling for the genocide of jews violate your university’s code of conduct?’ one after the other, after the other, said ‘It depends on the context’. And the world heard. It is now the most viewed congressional testimony in history.

Eight days ago, I was the first Member of Congress to demand that Columbia President Shafik resign for her failure to disband the antisemitic mob consuming Columbia’s campus and her failure to ensure the safety of Columbia’s Jewish students. Instead, she negotiated with these self-proclaimed terrorists allowing their antisemitic mob to grow.

Enough is enough. It is time to restore law and order, academic integrity, and moral decency to America’s higher education institutions.

Joe Biden has been deafeningly silent. So I want to thank, again, the Speaker, as well as all of our Chairs, who will ensure this is a top priority for House Republicans. There can be NO moral equivalency. It is time to send a clear message to the world that antisemitism has no place in America. The world is indeed watching.”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: Democrats’ Corrupt And Desperate Witch Hunts Against President Trump Must Come To An End
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her House colleagues to discuss her official ethics complaint against Jack Smith with the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility for his illegal election interference against President Donald Trump.

Stefanik also addressed the pro-Hamas, antisemitic rioting mob that took over an academic building at Columbia last night and reiterated her commitment to hold America’s so-called elite colleges and universities accountable.

Watch her full remarks here.

Find her full remarks below.

“The world is watching as the leadership of our so-called elite colleges and universities continue to fail to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus.

Just look at the abject failure of Columbia’s president to enforce their own code of conduct that they gave lip service to during the recent Education and Workforce hearing. Last night, the pro-Hamas, antisemitic mob took over an academic building. The university leadership has lost complete control. It is a disgrace, and it is untenable. And we as House Republicans will hold them to account. I will continue to lead on this issue, and House Republicans will expand our efforts on oversight with additional committee chairs with an announcement later today.

Also in New York, we are now in week three of Alvin Bragg’s witch hunt, the first criminal trial of a former President of the United States. It is crystal clear from the opening arguments and evidence that this extraordinarily weak case is blatant lawfare and election interference during the height of the presidential campaign.

While the violent crime crisis rages in New York, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg brought bogus felony charges against President Trump for the non-felony of booking a 2017 nuisance claim as a “legal expense.” Under this bogus legal theory, this somehow impacted the election. This theory is so baseless that it was previously passed over by the prior Manhattan DA, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney, the Federal Election Commission, and Alvin Bragg himself.

But a top political appointee in the Biden Justice Department was deployed to Bragg’s office to go after Joe Biden’s top political opponent and the Republican nominee: Donald J. Trump. And the case is in front of the Democrat Judge Juan Merchan who donated to Biden’s campaign. And whose daughter is raising tens of millions off this unprecedented case.

This is corrupt election interference to its core. Even a former Clinton federal judge said Judge Merchan must recuse. What was Merchan’s response? He retaliated against President Trump with an unconstitutional gag order.

Last week, the House Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Jim Jordan, released a scathing report highlighting Bragg's political investigation and prosecution of President Trump, calling it a direct threat to our republic. Democrats’ corrupt and desperate witch hunts against President Trump must come to an end. This is lawfare and blatant election interference, and the American people know it.

That is why today I filed an official complaint with the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility on Joe Biden’s special counsel Jack Smith for his clear and illegal efforts of election interference.

We will fight the Democrats’ unjust lawfare and expose this corruption. Whether it is in New York, Atlanta, or here in Washington, D.C., this is an important responsibility of our oversight.

In addition to this important oversight work, legislatively, House Republicans are continuing to lead on behalf of the American people. This week on the House floor, we have a series of bills to protect America’s public lands while ensuring the safe, reliable development of our natural resources. We are also marking the start of National Small Business Week, the backbone and economic engine of our country. So today, we are joined by two chairs, our Chairman of House Natural Resources Committee Bruce Westerman and Chairman of the Small Business Committee Roger Williams, to discuss in more detail.”

Title: Stefanik, D’Esposito, and Molinaro Urge Biden Administration to Oppose Arrest Warrants for Israeli Officials
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Congressman Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY) and Congressman Marc Molinaro (R-NY) to President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the Biden Administration to oppose any efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants on Israeli officials.

These warrants would set a dangerous precedent that will delegitimize Israel’s right to self-defense and threaten officials in all democracies fighting terrorists around the world, including America.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The leadership of our greatest ally stands falsely accused of war crimes, ranging from disproportionate force to deliberately starving the Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip. These accusations cannot be further from the truth. The civilian casualty ratio reported during these ongoing operations in the Gaza Strip is one of the lowest in any instance of urban warfare. That remains true even if you believe the figures coming from the Gaza Health Ministry. The latter accusation also stands on unsound foundations, as Israel has attempted to allow as much well-vetted humanitarian aid in as possible under the current security situation, accompanied by direct aid deliveries from the United States and our allies.”

The lawmakers continue,“The United States must continue to pressure the ICC to prevent any of these warrants being issued for members of the Israeli government. The ICC’s time and resources would be much better spent prosecuting the leadership of the terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, who sit in lavish apartment blocks in Qatar, far away from the conflict, and whose members have been well documented engaging in war crimes on October 7th. If they do decide to move forward with these arrest warrants, it is our hope that the administration will stand with our ally Israel, reject any attempts to execute these warrants, and enforce severe consequences on those engaged in this sham prosecution. We look forward to a prompt reply and immediate action.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Columbia University Surrendering To The Pro-Hamas Antisemitic Mob
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement condemning Columbia President Shafik for surrendering to the pro-Hamas sympathizers and failing to protect Columbia’s Jewish students. Columbia University's leadership has repeatedly extended their deadlines and refused to hold these terrorist sympathizers accountable.

“Columbia has surrendered to the radical pro-Hamas antisemitic mob instead of securing campus and protecting Columbia’s Jewish students. There can be no more extensions or delays. There can be no negotiations with self-proclaimed Hamas terrorists and their sympathizers.”

Title: Stefanik, Rubio Urge Biden Administration to Prohibit American Ingenuity From Advancing Communist Chinese Technology
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging the Biden Administration to immediately revoke all export licenses to Communist Chinese spy company Huawei after Huaweiannouncedthat it will be using new technology developed by American company Intel in their latest computers.

Huawei has been listed on the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Standards Entity List since 2019 meaning U.S. companies are required to apply for a license every time they seek to export new technology to Huawei. Huawei’s new computer containing Intel’s cutting edge chip technology makes it clear that the Biden Administration’s Department of Commerce approved a new license for Intel or broadly expanded their current license to allow them to export their technology to Huawei.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The Intel chipset in question is reportedly cutting-edge, with built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities that allow users to perform AI tasks without relying on servers in the cloud. Allowing cutting-edge American technology into Huawei’s newest PC will only make it easier for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to evade U.S. technology restrictions and race ahead in AI. Your department’s failure to enforce your own export-control regime will aid the CCP and the People’s Liberation Army as they seek to undermine America’s prime position in the world.”

The lawmakers continue,“While the Biden Administration “assesses,” Huawei grows stronger, entrenches deeper in the global economy, and advances PLA military capabilities. According to the Wall Street Journal, Huawei predicted that its revenue grew by nine percent in 2023, with a 64 percent increase in domestic smartphone sales. The company gained domestic market share for both PCs and smartphones. It is clear from these trends that Huawei, a blacklisted company that was on the ropes just a few years ago, is making a comeback. It is doing so because the Biden Administration, led by your department, is failing to protect American ingenuity.”

Title: Stefanik Urges DoD to Bolster U.S. Critical Mineral Companies Including Phoenix Tailings
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin urging the DoD to expedite the implementation of Section 152 of the FY24National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)which would allow the DoD to work with companies like Phoenix Tailings in Essex County, New York, to extract rare earth metals critical to strengthening our defense manufacturing sector and military readiness. Congresswoman Stefanik led and secured the inclusion of Section 152 in the FY24 NDAA. This provision grants the DoD with multiyear procurement authority to secure domestically processed critical minerals.

Phoenix Tailings is currently establishing a pilot program at the old Barton Hill mine in Moriah, New York. The Barton Hill facility will be a key part of a fully domestic rare earth metal processing operation. The multiyear procurement authority for critical minerals that Congresswoman Stefanik secured in the FY24 NDAA will enable the U.S. to end our reliance on Communist China for critical minerals and will boost critical mineral processing in Upstate New York and around America.

In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states,“The recent and consistent actions by Beijing, tightening export controls on rare earths and other critical minerals, underscore the urgent need for the implementation of measures such as Section 152 of the FY24 NDAA, as China continues to assert increased control over crucial supply chains, posing a significant threat to U.S. national security interests.  By committing to multiyear procurement contracts for domestically processed rare earths, we are doing more than just secure vital supplies; we build a resilient supply chain, reducing the risk of disruption and ensuring the continued production of critical defense technology.”

Stefanik continues,“It is imperative for the DoD to expedite the implementation of Section 152 with due consideration for its significant economic and, more importantly, national security implications. Securing a domestic rare earth metal supply chain is not merely about safeguarding our military readiness, but it’s a critical step in fortifying our nation’s resilience against external threats. By taking proactive measures, we strengthen our ability to maintain strategic autonomy and safeguard our national security interests for years to come.”

Title: Stefanik Demands Biden Administration Take Action To Ensure The Safety of Columbia University's Jewish Community
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, demanding action on Columbia University’s campus as Columbia President Minouche Shafik continues to allow an unsanctioned mob of students and agitators to harass and threaten Jewish students and community members.

Stefanik also calls for the Department of Education to revoke any federal funding Columbia University currently receives and publish the findings of the Title VI investigation the Biden Administration opened on Columbia following the October 7th attack.

Stefanik goes on to demand the Department of Homeland Security revoke the student visas of students who are brazenly endorsing terrorist organizations including Hamas in accordance with theImmigration and Nationality Actwhich asserts that anyone who endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization is ineligible for entry into the United States.

In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states,“Columbia University was one of the first schools into which the Biden Administration opened a Title VI investigation following the October 7th attack. There is clear and convincing evidence that students at Columbia have been targeted because they are Jewish, and the university has allowed this to persist without consequence. It is past time for the Department of Education to publish the findings of this investigation and hold the university accountable. Furthermore, the Department must take action to revoke any federal funding flowing to Columbia and similar institutions so taxpayers are not funding the ongoing discrimination.”

Stefanik continues,“Consequences are needed for those who are calling for terrorism and violent attacks. The Immigration and Nationality Act is clear – anyone who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization’’ is ineligible for entry into the United States. Individuals at these riots and campus events are brazenly endorsing Hamas and other terrorist organizations. By allowing this support for terror to continue, this wicked ideology is able to spread. I demand that you enforce existing law to revoke the visas and deport students here on visas who are suspended for their antisemitic actions. Strong leadership and action are needed to restore sanity on campus and protect those whose safety is being threatened.”

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletterto Columbia University President Dr. Minouche Shafik urging her to resign for failing to put an end to an unsanctioned mob of students and agitators involved in documented incidents of despicable antisemitic harassment and calls for violence and terrorism against Jewish students on Columbia’s campus.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“Over the past few days, anarchy has engulfed the campus of Columbia University. As the leader of this institution, one of your chief objectives, morally and under law, is to ensure students have a safe learning environment. By every measure, you have failed this obligation. The situation unfolding on campus right now is a direct product of your policies and misguided decisions. As Representatives from the State of New York, many of our constituents are directly impacted by the unfolding chaos on Columbia’s campus. Based on these recent events and your testimony in front of Congress, we have no confidence in your leadership of this once esteemed institution.”

The lawmakers continued,“The ongoing situation that has unfolded is a direct symptom of your continued lax enforcement of policy and clear double standards. Your failure to enforce the rules on campus has created an environment in which students and outside agitators know they are able to operate with impunity and without any accountability. While the rot is systemic, the responsibility rests squarely on your shoulders. It is time for Columbia University to turn the page on this shameful chapter. This can only be done through the restoration of order and your prompt resignation.”

Title: ICYMI: New York Post: Elise Stefanik, All NY House GOP Lawmakers Demand Columbia President Minouche Shafik Resign Immediately

Washington, D.C.– In case you missed it, today, theNew York Postreported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led a letter from the New York Republican Congressional Delegation demanding Columbia University President Dr. Minouche Shafik resign after failing to put an end to an unsanctioned mob of students and agitators involved in documented incidents of despicable antisemitic harassment and calls for violence and terrorism against Jewish students on Columbia’s campus.

Read the full article below:

New York Post:Elise Stefanik, all NY House GOP lawmakers demand Columbia President Minouche Shafik resign immediately

By Josh Christenson and Carl Campanile

“Stefanik and bipartisan members of the House Education and Workforce Committee grilled Shafik last week over her failures to protect Jewish students from intimidation, harassment and even assaults by anti-Israel demonstrators after Hamas killed an estimated 1,200 people — including 33 US citizens — in a surprise terror attack Oct. 7.

Columbia students told reporters before the House hearing that they have been targeted for wearing Star of David necklaces and shouted “F–k the Jews” in the kosher section of campus dining halls.

That same day, demonstrators descended onto the campus and set up dozens of tents in a show of force meant to convince Columbia to divest from Israel.

Many participants have defended Hamas’ actions and called for the eradication of the Jewish state, with one holding up a sign on Saturday night that called for the Al-Qassam military brigade of the terror group to pick Israeli flag-waving Columbia students as their “next targets.”

NYPD officers arrested more than 100 participants in the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” on Thursday at Shafik’s prompting, but the Republican lawmakers say the “illegal, antisemitic” demonstration had been permitted for two days beforehand — and has since been “shockingly allowed to reconvene” without police intervention.

In a Monday statement, Shafik pleaded with the undergrads to go home, saying Columbia had to “reset” and “address security concerns” from students “across an array of communities.”

“I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus. Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm,” Shafik also said.

Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who is Jewish, told The Post Columbia’s president was “waving the white flag” by opting to hold Monday classes remotely — which Blakeman called an admission Jewish students can’t be protected.

“This is outrageous. Shafik is not even adhering to Columbia’s own code of conduct. She has failed to protect the Jewish students’ right to go to class safely,” said Blakeman, a Republican, adding that “she should resign if she can’t control campus.”

“It’s a waving of the white flag. She has lost any courage. She has lost her moral compass,” he added. “Right now I’d be concerned about sending any student — letting alone a Jewish student — to Columbia.

“They have allowed the rise in antisemitism to fester. The professors are overwhelmingly liberal, woke and anti-American.”

Stefanik and the other GOP lawmakers also said Shafik’s congressional testimony had been “hollow” — pointing to conflicting statements about holding professors accused of antisemitism accountable.

Shafik testified last week that Joseph Massad, a modern Arab politics professor, was “under investigation” and would lose his post on an academic committee for his “unacceptable” conduct — including referring to the Oct. 7 massacre as “awesome.”

“President Shafik indicated that I am currently ‘under investigation’ for making discriminatory comments. This is news to me, as I have not been informed or contacted by anyone from the university to inform me of this alleged investigation,” Massad later told the far-left outlet Electronic Intifada.

“In fact, I had a meeting last week with the Columbia University Provost, Angela Olinto, about being subjected to harassment and racism by another university professor,” Massad added. “Provost Olinto conveyed to me her support and that she was sorry that I had been subjected to such harassment. The offending professor is the one currently being investigated.

“I remain the chair of the Academic Review Committee, a one-year position, for the next few weeks, which is the normal end of my chairmanship.”

The GOP letter to Shafik accused her of a “cover-up” over “the lack of punishment for pro-terror Professor Joseph Massad.”

“The words in your testimony ring hollow,” it said, “and you have clearly failed to live up to any commitment of enforcement.”

Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement.

“While Columbia’s failed leadership spent hundreds of hours preparing for this week’s Congressional hearing, it clearly was an attempt to cover up for their abject failure to enforce their own campus rules and protect Jewish students on campus. Over the past few months and especially the last 24 hours, Columbia’s leadership has clearly lost control of its campus putting Jewish students’ safety at risk. It is crystal clear that Columbia University - previously a beacon of academic excellence founded by Alexander Hamilton - needs new leadership. President Shafik must immediately resign. And the Columbia Board must appoint a President who will protect Jewish students and enforce school policies.”

North Country Now:Stefanik touts Protecting Rural Access to Care Act

By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik

During my tenure in Congress, I have strongly advocated for delivering high-quality rural healthcare for our families and seniors. A primary concern not only for my constituents across New York’s 21st Congressional District, but for millions of Americans living in rural communities across our country, is access to quality and affordable healthcare. These communities depend on their local hospitals to provide lifesaving care and treatments for their families yet the unique challenges of serving remote areas have led an increasing number of rural hospitals to shut down over the past decade.

In fact, according to data from the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, 191 rural hospitals have closed or converted to emergency or outpatient care over the last 18 years. These providers face the uniquely difficult task of providing excellent care despite immense financial challenges that have only been exacerbated in recent years. Rising costs paired with low-patient volume and a greater reliance on federal and state funds has led many rural hospitals to struggle to remain financially viable.

These barriers led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop several payment program options that allow for higher reimbursements for certain services provided by qualifying rural hospitals. Of the numerous CMS payment programs, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation has proven to be highly effective in reducing the financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and increasing access to care throughout medically underserved regions. CAHs receive higher reimbursements for their Medicare services provided, allowing them to remain open and keep essential healthcare services in rural communities. Across NY-21, Lewis County General Hospital, Carthage Area Hospital, River Hospital, University of Vermont Health Network - Elizabethtown and Alice Hyde Medical Center, Clifton-Fine Hospital, Massena Hospital, and Gouverneur Hospital all maintain a CAH designation.

I have long since advocated for the CAH designation as I understand its importance to hospitals across my district. In January 2021, I recognized an error in CMS’s certification policy that unjustly narrowed the eligibility criteria for hospitals to certify or recertify as a CAH. In response, I authored the bipartisan Protecting Rural Access to Care Act to protect hospitals at risk of losing their designation. Then in June 2021, I called on CMS to reverse this harmful policy and brought this concern to the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of vulnerable hospitals at risk of losing their CAH statuses. I was proud to see that following my advocacy CMS decided to reverse its disastrous policy and as a result, Carthage Area Hospital in NY-21 was able to maintain its designation.

Not only did my critical legislation and constant pressure force CMS to reverse course and allow Carthage Area Hospital to keep its CAH status, but it also opened the door for other hospitals across the region to qualify as well. I was pleased to see that in November 2023, Alice Hyde Medical Center of Malone received their CAH designation as a direct result of my efforts as well. I also sent a letter of support to CMS on behalf of Massena Hospital in December 2023 and I am happy to report that they were recently granted their CAH status as a result. My office is supporting other hospitals in the region as they navigate the application process with CMS and I look forward to continuing to advocate on their behalf.

As the representative for NY-21, I remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring our hospitals have the resources necessary to expand access to care throughout Upstate New York and the North Country.

Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led the introduction of the bipartisanBlast Overpressure Safety Actwith Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) to better mitigate and protect service members from blast overpressure and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) they may be exposed to in the line of duty.

“As the Chief advocate for Fort Drum in Congress the safety and security of the 10th Mountain Division soldiers is one of my top priorities which is why I am proud to co-lead the bipartisan Blast Overpressure Safety Act in the House with Congressman Khanna to protect our brave service members from blast overpressure and TBI,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This legislation will ensure soldiers, such as our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who were attacked in Iraq and Syria last year, receive adequate care.”

"As ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems, I’m proud to partner with Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to lead the bipartisan Blast Overpressure Safety Act to protect American service members from the overlooked dangers of traumatic brain injuries and blast overpressure. By improving care, mitigating exposure, and providing greater transparency in our military's equipment procurement process, we can protect the health of the brave men and women who serve our country,”said Congressman Ro Khanna.

“Brain health plays a crucial role in many veterans’ overall quality of life. Head-related trauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), is sometimes referred to as the ‘signature injury’ for post-9/11 veterans due to the increased TBI prevalence among veterans of this generation. Wounded Warrior Project’s (WWP’s) 2022 Annual Warrior Survey found that 36.5% of WWP warriors self-reported experiencing TBI due to military service,”said Jen Silva, Chief Program Officer of the Wounded Warrior Project.“The Blast Overpressure Safety Act will help protect Service members from blast overpressure and TBI; improve research and data collection regarding brain health and safety; and expand access to effective treatments and support for veterans with a brain injury. WWP supports this bill, and we applaud the representatives for their efforts to address this critical issue.”

Specifically,Blast Overpressure Safety Act:

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: Columbia University Is Working Overtime To Cover-up Their Failure To Combat Antisemitism On Campus & House Republicans Will Hold Them Accountable
Date: 2024

Washington, D.C.– House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joinedMornings With Mariato discuss today’sHouse Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing with Columbia University President Minouche Shafikabout the rise in antisemitic attacks at the university and Columbia’s failure to keep members of its Jewish community safe since the horrific October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights of her interview below:

On The Rampant Antisemitism Happening On Columbia University’s Campus:

Well, first of all, it's important for the viewers to know that the Columbia President was in fact invited when we had that historic hearing with Harvard, MIT, and Penn, and she did not attend that hearing. So as she looks at the past couple of months as the earthquake and the reckoning, and those two presidents became former presidents, there's been clearly a lot of preparation. She hired PR consultants, various attorneys, to prepare today's testimony that's not going to cover-up for the failure of Columbia University to fail to protect Jewish students. They have tolerated and allowed professors who have antisemitic, consistent remarks targeting Jewish students. It includes assault. They have not ensured that their rules are applied, for example, they have rules when it comes to where student groups can protest and anti Israeli groups are breaking those rules and there's no disciplinary action taken. So we're going to ask those tough questions of this Columbia University professor. But I'll tell you, they're working overtime to try to cover this up. You saw an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. My question though is, they hired so many PR consultants to help the university presidents, how many people have they hired on campus to combat antisemitism? The answer is zero. And I will hold them accountable. We will hold them accountable.

On Calls For The President Of Columbia University To Resign:

Well, certainly with her failure to condemn antisemitism, yes. That is going to be exposed in full at this hearing. No matter how much preparation, the facts are there. This is rampant on Columbia and it's one of the dens of antisemitism that's the worst on college campuses.

“Today, House Republicans led by Chairwoman Foxx will continue our investigation of the heinous scourge of antisemitism running rampant on America's college campuses.

A few months ago, when the university presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT testified, they made history for their morally bankrupt answers as the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress. And two are now former presidents.

And after billions of views and world outcry, it set off a long overdue earthquake in higher education. The Columbia University President was invited to that hearing but did not attend. Today, the Columbia President will appear in front of the Education and Workforce Committee along with board of trustee leaders, and we will hold them accountable for their failure to combat antisemitism on their campus and their failure to protect Jewish students.

For over 200 years, Columbia University has held the same motto “in thy light shall we see light”. Taken from Psalms, Columbia claims to work in God’s light. Sadly, for all the Jewish students on their campus, this could not be further from the truth. Fueled by hatred and ignorance, unchecked antisemitism has become commonplace on Columbia’s campus: Nazi-era antisemitic propaganda litters the grounds, Swastikas graffiti school property, and mobs assaulting Jewish students, professors openly supporting Hamas and calling for genocide of the Jewish people. Meanwhile, despite claims otherwise, Columbia’s leadership refuses to enforce their own policies and condemn Jewish hatred on campus creating a breeding ground for antisemitism and a hotbed of support for terrorism from radicalized faculty and students.

Just look at the campus reaction following the tragic events of October 7th. Over 150 Columbia faculty justified the terrorist attack on Israel resulting in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. A Columbia Professor penned an article glorifying Hamas, and anti-Israel student groups invited known members of a terrorist group to speak in support of the terrorist slaughter.

This hearing is an important step towards transparency and accountability in Chairwoman Foxx’s investigation and in our oversight of the failure of colleges and universities to condemn and combat antisemitism and their failure to protect Jewish students.

Before our hearing, we wanted to make sure America hears the firsthand experiences directly from Jewish students studying at Columbia. We are joined today by Eden Yadegar, a junior at Columbia University, and Yola Ashkenazie, a senior at Barnard College."

Title: Stefanik Statement On Columbia University's Failure To Combat Antisemitism Following The Inconsistent And Unacceptable Testimony From Their Campus Leadership
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Senior Member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, released the following statement on the rampant antisemitism infecting Columbia University and higher education following the inconsistent testimony of the Columbia University leadership and their Board of Trustees.

“Today's hearing of Columbia University president and board members epitomizes the failed leadership on "elite" college campuses to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students. From the university president's moral equivocation on antisemitism, to glaringly inconsistent testimony regarding disciplinary action and lack thereof taken against antisemitic students and pro-terrorist faculty, to astonishingly stating that there has been no "anti-Jewish" protests on campus only to then acknowledge that "F-- the Jews" & "Death to the Jews" is in-fact anti-Jewish when she was further pressed.

Interestingly, during a break, the witnesses were overheard discussing how well they thought their testimony was going for Columbia. This arrogance is eerily reminiscent to the previous three university presidents who believed walking out of the hearing that their testimony was acceptable. Columbia is in for a reckoning of accountability.

If it takes a member of Congress to force a university president to fire a pro-terrorist, antisemitic faculty chair, then Columbia University leadership is failing Jewish students and its academic mission. No amount of overlawyered, overprepped, and over-consulted testimony is going to cover up for failure to act.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Demands Columbia University President Commit to Fighting Antisemitism on Campus
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, had multiple rounds of questions for President of Columbia University Dr. Nemat Shafik and Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald about Columbia’s failure to adequately respond to the spread of antisemitism on their campus following the terrorist attacks on Israel committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.

Watch her full line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:I want to follow up on my colleague Rep. Walberg’s question regarding Professor Joseph Massad. So let me be clear, President, that he was spoken to. Who spoke with him?

President Shafik:He was spoken to by his Head of Department and his Dean.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And what was he told?

President Shafik:I was not in those conversations. I think he was told that that language was unacceptable.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you’re not aware of what he was told? What was he told?

President Shafik:That that language was unacceptable.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And were there any other enforcement actions taken? Any other disciplinary actions taken?

President Shafik:In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Does he need to repeat stating that the massacre of Israeli civilians was ‘awesome’? Does he need to repeat his participation in an unauthorized, pro-Hamas demonstration on April 4th? You know, Professor David Schizer talked about the lack of enforcement. Do you agree that this is an issue with a lack of enforcement when the policy of Columbia specifically stated on April 5th said, ‘I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence,’ and yet you have no action? No disciplinary action. Do you agree with how the university has handled this?

President Shafik:Yeah, we have 4,700 faculty at Columbia, most of whom spend all of their time dedicated to teaching their students

Congresswoman Stefanik:But I'm talking about the faculty members who are supporting terror and it's not just that case. Let me bring your attention to Mohamed Abdou who was hired after the October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. He, on October 11th, posted: ‘Yes, I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.’ He also decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the heads of children and being rapists. We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors, of women, there were rapes and yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring?

President Shafik:I share with you your repugnance at those remarks. I completely understand that. On my watch, faculty who make remarks that cross the line in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences for them.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What are the consequences in this case?

President Shafik:I have five cases at the moment who have either been either taken out of the classroom or dismissed.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And is he one of those?

President Shafik:He will never work at Columbia again.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So he has been terminated?

President Shafik:He has been terminated and not just terminated, but his files will show that he will never work at Columbia again.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So he is currently not employed by Columbia?

President Shafik:He is grading his students’ papers and will never teach at Columbia again and that will be on his permanent record.

Congresswoman Stefanik:How are you changing the hiring processes? Because on your watch, he was hired after he made these statements publicly? How are you ensuring this does not happen with your hiring process going forward?

President Shafik:So when we hire people, obviously they have to meet the academic qualifications, but we do an employment check and a criminal record check. We also ask everyone to do an attestation that they have never been accused of discrimination or part of an investigation around harassment or discrimination. And that attestation has to be signed by all new employees.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And it didn’t work in this case.

President Shafik:I think in this case, while he may not have been subject to an investigation on discrimination or found guilty, it has to be found guilty.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But don’t you think it’s a problem when the hiring process of Columbia is hiring someone who makes those statements, and is hiring them after making those statements?

President Shafik:I agree with you that I think we need to look at how to toughen up those requirements. We do have a requirement, but I agree with you. I think we need to look at how we can make it more effective.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Let me ask about Professor Katherine Frank from the Columbia Law School who said that ‘all Israeli students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn’t be on campus.’ What disciplinary action has been taken against that professor?’

President Shafik:I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable and discriminatory.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But I'm asking you what disciplinary action has been taken.

President Shafik:She has been spoken to by very senior person in the administration and she has said that that was not what she intended to say.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And has she publicly apologized?

President Shafik:I have suggested that. I think she will be finding a way toclarify her position.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You see the concern here though, with the lack of enforcement. You see the concern that speaking to these professors is not enough and it's sending a message across the university that this is tolerated. These antisemitic statements from a position of authority in professors in the classroom is tolerated. My time has expired, but I will have multiple rounds with questions.

…

Congresswoman Stefanik:Just to follow up, you should know this President Shafik, but Massad is still in fact listed on the Columbia website as Chair of the Academic Review Committee. Are you aware of that?

President Shafik:I would need to check that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:The website’s right here. So he hasn't been removed as Chair? Do you have my commitment that he'll be removed as Chair today?

President Shafik:I have my commitment that I will come back to you and give you the facts.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So he hasn't been removed. So you said in front of Congress, under oath, that he was removed.

President Shafik:No, I said I am not sure. I need to check.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Well, I'll tell you what he's still listed as chair. Let me ask the Board of Trustees. Is that acceptable that he's chair of this committee? Should he be removed today, Ms. Shipman?

Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman:Congresswoman, you've put your finger on one of the hardest issues we as board chairs face right now. I think you can see our systems from the videos you played, everything you're talking about, our systems of rules and enforcement…

Congresswoman Stefanik:Are broken, they're broken. My question to you, Ms. Shipman, and I'm the one asking the questions here as the United States Member of Congress, is: Do you believe that he should be removed as chair because currently he's listed as chair on Columbia University's website?

Co-Chair Shipman:I don't believe any professor at Columbia should say anything like, our professors have to be held to a higher standard than our students. And I can tell you that our board–

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you can't say at this hearing that he should be removed as chair even though he violates university rules?

Co-Chair Shipman:I personally don’t want him as chair and we are looking at the issue of faculty and what we expect from our faculty.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Greenwald, do you think he should be removed as chair?

Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald:His comments are abhorrent and I believe that one of the steps that we could take in terms of discipline is to remove him from that leadership position.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Thank you for that direct answer. And just to let you know, Mr. Abdou is not grading papers right now. He's on campus at the unsanctioned anti-Israel, antisemitic event that is being supported by pro-Hamas activists on campus. So that's what Professor Abdou is doing at this very moment.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Secures Columbia University President’s Commitment to Remove Antisemitic Professor from Leadership Role
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, had multiple rounds of questions for President of Columbia University Dr. Nemat Shafik, Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, and Columbia Law School Dean Emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law & Economics Professor David Schizer on the presence of anti-Jewish protests on their campus.

Stefanik also secured a commitment from President Shafik to remove Joseph Massad as Chair of the Academic Review Committee after Massad described the October 7th attacks on Israel as “astonishing,” “astounding,” and “awesome.”

Watch her full line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Dr. Shafik, you answered one of the questions of our colleagues across the aisle. You said there has been no anti-Jewish protests. Do the other individuals on the panel agree with that? Let’s start with you Professor Schizer.

Dean Emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law & Economics Professor David Schizer:So I think there have been antisemitic protests, so I would say yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So you disagree? There have been anti-Jewish protests. Ms. Shipman?

Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman:I know there have been a number of incidents, especially one at our law school recently that the students were trying to call a protest, but it was an event to harass admitted students who were Jewish and it's outrageous.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So that’s anti-Jewish, so the answer would be yes?

Co-Chair Shipman:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And Mr. Greenwald?

Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald:There have been antisemitic events on campus which I interpret as anti-Jewish.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And Dr. Shafik, you realize that at some of these events, the slurs and the chants have been ‘F the Jews,’ ‘death to Jews,’ ‘F Israel,’ ‘no safe place,’ ‘death to the Zionist state,’ ‘Jews out,’ you don't think those are anti-Jewish?

President Shafik:Completely anti-Jewish. Completely unacceptable.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So you changed your testimony on that issue as well? So there have been anti-Jewish protests.

President Shafik:I didn’t get to finish my sentence. So, what I was going to say was there were protests that were called, that were–

Congresswoman Stefanik:That’s not what you were asked. You were asked were there any anti-Jewish protests and you said ‘No’.

President Shafik:So the protest was not labeled as an anti-Jewish protest. It was labeled as an anti-Israeli government. But antisemitic incidents happened or antisemitic things were said. So I just wanted to finish.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I’m not asking what it was labeled. The question wasn’t what it was labeled. It was a Anti-Jewish protest. You agree with that? You change your testimony?

President Shafik:Congresswoman, anti-Jewish things were said at protests, yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Thank you for changing your testimony. Another instance when you changed your testimony is: You stated that Professor Massad was no longer Chair. Then you stated he’s under investigation. He is still chair on the website. So, has he been terminated as chair?

President Shafik:Congresswoman, I want to confirm the facts before getting back to you.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I know you confirmed that he was under investigation.

President Shafik:Yes, I can confirm that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Did you confirm he was still the chair?

President Shafik:I need to confirm that with you. I want to – I need to check.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Well, let me ask you this: Will you make the commitment to remove him as chair?

President Shafik:I think that would be – I think I would, yes. Let me come back with yes. But I think I just want to confirm his current status before I reply.

Congresswoman Stefanik:We’ll take that as a yes, that you will confirm that he will no longer be chair.

…

Congresswoman Stefanik:Ms. Shipman, was there an effort to get other trustees to sign a letter supporting President Shafik?

Co-Chair Shipman:No.

Congresswoman Stefanik:There was not?

Co-Chair Shipman:No.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Will you comply with all document requests related to email correspondence regarding any potential letter? Because board members have come forward anonymously to this committee raising the issue of a letter that was circulated that members of the boards did not sign on in support. Are you testifying today under oath you have no knowledge of any draft letter in support of Dr. Shafik?

Co-Chair Shipman:No knowledge whatsoever. And my understanding is we are fully complying and ready to give you whatever you need.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Greenwald, are you aware of any letter that was circulated?

Co-Chair David Greenwald:No, that's surprising to me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Professor David, are you aware?

ProfessorDavidSchizer:Not at all.

Congresswoman Stefanik:My final question is: There's been a lot of discussion on Columbia putting out a statement against calling for the genocide of Jews. That statement was put out after the catastrophically, morally repugnant answers by your colleagues from MIT, Penn, and Harvard, correct? That was when you put out that statement after that hearing?

Dr. Shafik:Congresswoman, you shed light on an important issue.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I'm just asking you when you put it out. It was after that hearing.

Dr. Shafik:It was definitely after it because, frankly, it seemed obvious.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You are aware that Congress voted 377 to 44 condemning antisemitism. That is a strong bipartisan vote. Would you support that vote condemning antisemitism?

Dr. Shafik:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And you are aware that in that bill, that got 377 Members out of 435 Members of Congress, condemns ‘from the river to the sea’ as antisemitic?

Dr. Shafik:Yes, I am aware of that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you dont believe ‘from the river to the sea’ is antisemitic?

Dr. Shafik:We have already issued a statement to our community saying that language is hurtful and we would prefer not to hear it on our campus.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You prefer not to hear it, or is there disciplinary action taken against students of those antisemitic statements? I want an answer to that question.

Dr. Shafik:I’m sorry, can you repeat the question?

Congresswoman Stefanik:Has there been disciplinary action taken against students who have chanted ‘from the river to the sea’ which you have testified as antisemitic and which Congress has voted that it is antisemitic?

Dr. Shafik:We have some disciplinary cases ongoing around that language. We have specified that those kinds of chants should be restricted in terms of where they happen. We are looking at it. We are looking at it.

Title: House GOP Leadership Statement on Senate Ignoring Constitutional Duty to Hold Mayorkas Impeachment Trial
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Today, Speaker Johnson, Leader Scalise, Whip Emmer, and Chairwoman Stefanik released the following statement after the Democrat-led Senate voted to dismiss the articles of impeachment brought against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ignoring its constitutional duty to hold a trial.

“By voting unanimously to bypass their constitutional responsibility, every single Senate Democrat has issued their full endorsement of the Biden Administration’s dangerous open border policies. Secretary Mayorkas alongside President Biden has used nearly every tool at his disposal to engineer the greatest humanitarian and national security catastrophe at our borders in American history.

“Tragically, Senate Democrats don’t believe this catastrophe merits their time or a discussion on the Senate floor. Instead, they’re signaling to millions demanding accountability that the cabinet official directly responsible for this disaster – who has ignored the law and misled Congress repeatedly – is above reproach. The American people will hold Senate Democrats accountable for this shameful display.”

Watch her full remarks below.

Find her full remarks below.

“Under Joe Biden, the world is less safe.

Since stepping into the Oval Office, Joe Biden’s weak foreign policy has been defined by a steady stream of disastrous decisions and a world in chaos as a result. His desperate policy of appeasement has left our nation and our allies vulnerable to attack.

Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because Russia feared no reprisal from Joe Biden. Communist China flew a balloon over the United States, and Joe Biden allowed it. And who can forget Joe Biden’s catastrophic and botched Afghanistan withdrawal abandoning American interests in the Middle East and resulting in 13 American lives lost. All under Joe Biden’s watch.

And now Israel, our most precious ally, is in the fight for her very survival, facing an onslaught of attacks on its borders from Hamas and now the unprecedented attack from Iran over the weekend.

Russia, Communist China, and Iran have been emboldened by the utter failures of Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. Our enemies do not fear recourse from America because of Joe Biden’s weakness. For the sake of Israel’s survival, our nation, and the world’s security we need to return to President Trump’s peace through strength policies which House Republicans proudly support.”

NY Post:The House Will Hold Columbia Accountable For Its Campus Antisemitism

By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik

The world watched in horror over the weekend as Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones in an unprecedented attack against Israel.

Following decades of proxy warfare, the Iranian regime is directly attacking our greatest ally.

This comes months after the barbaric Oct. 7 attacks when Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and brutally murdered, raped, tortured and kidnapped more than a thousand innocent Israeli civilians, leading to the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

The unprecedented and continuous attacks on Israel’s very existence have shocked the conscience of the world.

They also exposed the deep rot of antisemitism that exists within our society, and unfortunately no sector has allowed this rot to grow more than America’s colleges and universities.

In December, I exposed just how ingrained antisemitism has become at America’s so-called “elite” institutions of higher education when I questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn in what has become the most-viewed congressional testimony in history.

These presidents’ disgraceful attempts to contextualize my straightforward question — “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct?” — were a symptom of decades of moral decay, intellectual laziness and dangerous far-left radical groupthink.

As a result of this hearing, two presidents were ousted, and the House Education and the Workforce Committee and Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) launched an investigation into antisemitism at America’s colleges and universities.

Columbia University President Minouche Shafik was invited to attend December’s Education Committee hearing but did not appear, citing a scheduling conflict.

Since the horrific Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, antisemitism and antisemitic attacks at Columbia have been egregious and commonplace.

Shafik and Columbia board of trustees co-chairs will appear before the committee Wednesday to answer questions regarding their failures to ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment.

More than 150 Columbia faculty members joined in a letter describing Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack as “just one salvo in an ongoing war between an occupying state and the people it occupies, or as an occupied people exercising a right to resist.”

Columbia’s Students for Justice in Palestine declared they were “in full solidarity” with Hamas’ “resistance.”

The university continues to employ a professor who described the Oct. 7 attack as “astonishing,” “astounding” and “awesome,” while events like Resistance 101, led by a man who spoke of “friends and brothers in Hamas,” continue to proliferate.

In February, students from schools across the country attended an Education Committee roundtable where they shared their stories about the horrors of antisemitism they’ve seen and experienced on their campuses.

One Columbia student cited a clear double standard and lack of rule enforcement against organizations attacking Jewish students.

Our investigation has highlighted the need for real change and action at these institutions, as implementing half-measures are not enough.

While Columbia suspended Students for Justice in Palestine, it has failed to enforce its rules on demonstrations.

Like many universities, Columbia stood up a task force, but it failed to even define antisemitism and cowardly failed to condemn chants of “Death to the Zionist State.”

We will bring Columbia leadership in front of Congress and hold them accountable for these incidents and their inadequate response to our investigation.

Universities have a duty to keep their students safe.

And when they fail, Congress has the duty to conduct rigorous oversight of the billions of US taxpayer dollars that support these higher-ed institutions.

We will not rest until this unchecked antisemitism is stopped.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik OpEd in Real Clear Defense: The Air Force’s Future Flag Experiment Is A Success
Date: 2024

Washington, D.C.-In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published anop-edinReal Clear Defensehighlighting the need for the Department of Defense to better identify organizations that embrace innovation and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter highlighting Future Flag’s model of experimentation and active risk reduction.

The Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome offers an opportunity for the Department of Defense to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies in the town of Lewis in Essex County, New York.

Read the full article below.

Real Clear Defense:The Air Force’s Future Flag Experiment Is A Success

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

New York’s 21st Congressional District has a long and distinguished history of playing a critical role in U.S. national security. From the renowned Battles of Saratoga that turned the tide of the Revolutionary War to the work of Strategic Air Command’s missileers at Plattsburgh Air Force Base during the Cold War, to today’s continued service of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, the region’s history of service and innovation is ingrained in Upstate New York and North Country culture. In today’s global climate of competition and instability, the innovative ecosystem in NY-21 is more critical than ever.

Carrying on the region’s tradition of service and conducted annually in Lewis, New York, the Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome (AFRL-Rome) offers a unique opportunity for the Department of Defense (DoD) to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies while they are in the hands of operators. Designed as a joint operational and laboratory effort, Future Flag brings together operational personnel, research and development teams, and government and industry, to enable rapid design, solution development, and prototyping. Future Flag cuts through the bureaucracy to effectively integrate technology for the warfighter at the speed of relevance in today’s ever-changing world without the typical constraints found in the DoD.

The key to this effort is the objective experimentation’s focus on collaboration across multiple communities with direct and unfiltered exchange of ideas and concepts. Seldom do operators, developers, and engineers have a chance to work together in small unit level operational settings. Future Flag offers the opportunity to reduce risk, focus limited resources, and provide the warfighter with new and unique capabilities targeting their actual needs, not poorly conceived and out-of-date requirements. Future Flag’s results are sent forward into large scale exercises like Northern Edge, or into Combatant Commands (COCOMs) where they are directly impacting current operations.

Future Flag creates a process where industry can iterate and develop technologies unconstrained by conventional doctrine. The goal of developing new technologies is to provide new capabilities, which in turn require new doctrine. Unlike traditional approaches to development that allow for only slow evolution of doctrine to exploit new and emerging capabilities, Future Flag starts by throwing out conventional doctrinal constraints, allowing the operators and engineers to push their limits and test the art of the possible to rapidly provide vital capabilities to the warfighter.

The Future Flag series is already yielding critical results that are contributing to strategic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). The Air Force’s Air Combat Command worked with the Future Flag team to rapidly experiment with edge computing for the MQ-9 Reaper’s M2DO (Multi Domain) configuration in Lewis, NY. These experiments directly resulted in enhancing the MQ-9 platform with critical command and control and electro-optical/infra-red sensing capabilities, significantly increasing the Air Force’s ability to conduct unmanned-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions in INDOPACOM.

It is critical that we continue to provide our service members with resources to conduct these vital missions. Following my advocacy, the final FY 2024 defense appropriations bill included $25 million for Air Force Research Laboratory-Rome to expand the scope of Future Flag. In keeping with my commitment to provide our warfighters with the very best capabilities, Future Flag represents one of the earliest and most effective forays into the arena of contractor owned, contractor operated large scale operational laboratories in the nation.

The DoD must better identify organizations and activities that embrace innovation, like Future Flag, and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter. To truly innovate and get capabilities to the warfighter at relevant speed and scale, DoD must scale Future Flag’s innovative model of aggressive experimentation and active risk reduction. The DoD’s repeated failure to appropriately manage risk in pursuit of innovation only shifts the risk to the operational community. Future Flag must be the standard in testing, evaluation, and experimentation, not the exception. The stakes are too high to fail at placing anything but the best capabilities in the hands of the warfighter.

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement following Iran's attacks on Israel.

"Joe Biden’s catastrophic weakness on the world stage and his failure to support Israel our most precious ally emboldened Iran to launch a direct attack on Israel.

As soon as Joe Biden took office, he reversed President Trump’s Maximum Pressure Campaign on Iran and less than six months ago he allowed critical international sanctions on Iran’s missile and drone programs to expire, empowering Iran to launch this massive strike.

The United States must stand with Israel and offer our unwavering support."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Holds Missile Defense Agency Accountable to Use $10M at Fort Drum to Improve Homeland Missile Defense, as Congressionally Directed
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, demanded that Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Lieutenant General Heath Collins use the $10 million Congresswoman Stefanik secured via the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to begin the planning and design of a third missile defense site at Fort Drum, the DoD’spreferredlocation for a third missile defense site.

In the FY24Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congresswoman Stefanik secured a $10M increase for the MDA to conduct planning and design for a third missile defense site at Fort Drum. In the FY24 NDAA, Congresswoman Stefanik led an effort to includereportlanguage that states this additional money should be used for “military construction planning and design activities needed to construct a missile defense interceptor site at Fort Drum, New York.” In 2019, the Department of Defense designated Fort Drum as the preferred location for an East Coast missile defense site. The United States’ missile defense architecture is currently aging and a third site would provide additional missile defense coverage to protect our homeland.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“First I would like to correct the record. Earlier in this hearing, the ranking member said that the Department of Defense chose Fort Drum as the preferred missile defense site for the third homeland missile defense site nearly ten years ago. That is incorrect despite the fact that you said that’s correct. General Collins, you are aware that the date that that was designated was 2019, correct?

Lieutenant General Heath Collins:“Yes, ma’am.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“So the ten years ago was incorrect.”

Lieutenant General Collins:“Yes, ma’am. Four years ago.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Great. You are also aware that just last year, General Milley and Vice Admiral Hill testified in front of thisCommittee that the construction of a third site at Fort Drum would be strategically worthwhile, correct? You’re aware of that testimony?”

Lieutenant General Collins:“Yes, ma’am.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And you’re also aware that in multiple NDAAs, the language designating Fort Drum as the preferred third site for East Coast missile defense site has been included in multiple NDAAs, you’re aware of that?”

Lieutenant General Collins:“Yes, ma’am.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And just let the record reflect the Ranking Member voted in support of that language, not once but multiple times, as well as voted for Appropriations as did the majority of members of this Committee. Now, in the FY14 Appropriations Act and the NDAA, we worked to secure $10 million in planning and design funds for the Missile Defense Agency to begin construction activities for a third homeland missile defense site at Fort Drum. My question to you, General Collins, is: As the Director of MDA, can you confirm to me that this $10 million is being used at Fort Drum as dictated by Congress as explicitly stated by Congress at Fort Drum to begin the planning and design of a third missile defense site? ”

Lieutenant General Collins:“Ma’am, that $10 million has been authorized and appropriated for that purpose, and that’s the purpose we’re executing it for.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And what are you using that for?”

Lieutenant General Collins:“That is to do the initial planning and development of a design for continental interceptor site to take it to the 10 percent design level?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“At Fort Drum?”

Lieutenant General Collins:“We are pursuing an agnostic design that would support–”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“That’s not what the language said.”

Lieutenant General Collins:“By doing it as an agnostic site, we would not slow down the capability to do it at Fort Drum.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“That’s not what the language that was passed by Congress said. And you understand that in the NDAA, for multiple years, it had designated Fort Drum. There were three sites under consideration in three different states. There was a process, an environmental impact study. This has been a very thorough process. And so you're saying to me today that the $10 million is not designated at Fort Drum for the planning and design?”

Lieutenant General Collins:“It is. It supports a continental interceptor site at any location that's determined to be optimal in the future in line with the 2019 memo that the department signed out.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Designating Fort Drum.”

Lieutenant General Collins:“Fort Drum, and it also designated that when a requirement was set for a continental site that there would have to be a readdress and a reassessment of location based on performance.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Even though you said in my office when we met, General Collins, in my office, that you understood that the $10 million would go to the design and planning at Fort Drum, as specified by the NDAA.”

Lieutenant General Collins:“When a decision, if a decision is made to pursue a Fort Drum site, the $10 million will be 100 percent in line with being able to accomplish that.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“But you do understand that multiple NDAAs Fort Drum has been designated, as well as by DoD.”

Lieutenant General Collins:“I’m aware, ma’am, of the report the Department signed out and the previous NDAAs.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Okay, great. With that, I will yield back.”

Title: Stefanik Demands Accountability from Harvard for Failing to Reprimand Antisemitic Students who Assaulted Jewish Student
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterto Harvard University Interim President Dr. Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny Pritzker demanding Harvard hold perpetrators of antisemitism accountable after obtaining adocumentfrom a law firm representing the victim of verbal harassment and physical assault at the university.

On October 18, 2023, Harvard’s Palestine Solidarity Committee staged a “die-in” at Harvard Business School where students attacked Israel’s efforts to defend itself following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. During this event, an Israeli Harvard Business School student recorded the act and was quickly surrounded by a mob of antisemitic perpetrators who physically assaulted and harassed him. These assailants blocked his path, repeatedly grabbed him, and shouted “Shame! Shame! Shame!"

According to documents obtained by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, following this incident Harvard engaged the law firm of Jenner & Block to conduct an independent investigation of the incident. Jenner & Block met with the victims’ attorneys at the law firm Holtzman Vogel in early January 2024 and received relevant video evidence of the incident.

Further information shows that local prosecutors are currently in the process of negotiating court dates with two of the Harvard students who assaulted the victim. On March 25, Holtzman Vogel learned that the “Clerk’s Hearing” in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7. One of the assailants in the incident, an antisemitic Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student.

In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states,“Justice for this incident should have been served quickly, and the delay of justice that specifically allows an antisemitic student to graduate is an affront to accountability and demonstrates the cultural rot of Harvard University’s leadership that has allowed antisemitism to continue.”

Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led theVeterans Claims Quality Improvement Actwith Morgan Luttrell (R-TX), Chairman of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee of the House Veterans' Affairs (VA) Committee, and Congressman Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), to ensure that the VA Board of Veterans’ Appeals provides veterans and their families with legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits in a timely manner.

“Bringing the concerns of our veterans and service members to the highest levels of government will always be one of my top priorities. I am proud to co-lead Chairman Luttrell’s legislation to ensure our veterans’ claims are processed and results are delivered with the urgency they deserve,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“Over the course of several hearings, I’ve heard time and again about the Veterans Affairs Board of Appeals failing to ensure quality decision making on veterans’ claims,”said Congressman Morgan Luttrell.“The legislation I introduced this week would ensure that the Veteran Affairs Board of Appeals provides veterans and their families with legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits. I will continue to hold the VA’s feet to the fire and do everything in my power to course correct this ship.”

“Veterans and their families have earned legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits. But right now, that’s not always the case. As a result, veterans are stuck in limbo waiting years on end for their earned disability compensation benefits,”said Mike Bost (R-IL), Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.“My friend and colleague, Rep. Luttrell, has introduced the Veterans Claims Quality Improvement Act, which would make vitally important improvements to the VA appeals process by implementing a robust quality assurance program so that veterans have a system at the VA Board of Veterans’ Appeals that they can trust. Rep. Luttrell and I know firsthand that we can’t take our foot off the gas when it comes to modernizing and pushing VA’s disability compensation benefits processes forward.”

“I’m grateful for Chairman Luttrell’s leadership on this important bill that will help address the glaring performance problems routinely made when the VA Board of Veterans Appeals reviews Veterans’ benefit claims,”said Congressman Gus Bilirakis.“These errors unnecessarily delay our nation’s heroes from accessing the benefits they deserve and is a concern that has been raised by many of my constituents. Our bill is an important part of the solution, as it will strengthen quality assurance metrics and provide much needed accountability.”

National Review:Stefanik Blasts Harvard for Failure to Discipline Students Who Allegedly Assaulted Israeli Classmate

By Zach Kessel

Representative Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) sent a letter to Harvard University leadership on Thursday asking why the administration has yet to discipline anti-Israel campus protesters who allegedly accosted and assaulted an Israeli student.

During an October 18 “die-in” demonstration intended to signal opposition to Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Hamas after the October 7 terrorist attack, multiple keffiyeh-clad protesterssurroundedan Israeli first-year business student, grabbing, pushing, and yelling at him.

Harvard has since engaged a law firm to conduct an independent investigation of the incident, and as Stefanik wrote in herletter, local prosecutors are currently in the process of scheduling court hearings for two of the assailants.

On March 25, though, the victim’s legal representation “learned that the ‘Clerk’s Hearing’ in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7.”

“One of the assailants in the incident, a Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student,” Stefanik wrote.

The firm representing the victim, Holtzman Vogel, wrote aletterin March to the attorney Harvard retained to conduct its internal investigation asking why the probe had not progressed since it began.

Noting that the university and its legal team had not notified them of any developments in the investigation and had not issued proper disciplinary action, the team of attorneys wrote that “the protracted delay all but ensures that at least one of the offending individuals will have the privilege of graduating from Harvard without facing any serious academic or professional consequences for his actions.”

The lack of punishment, the attorneys wrote, sends a message that “Harvard students can harass and assault a Jewish individual on camera with impunity, advertise the attack on social media, and still receive a Harvard degree, scot-free.”

Stefanik, reminding interim Harvard president Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny Pritzker of former president Claudine Gay’s performance at a December congressional hearing, wrote that this latest instance of the university’s refusal to discipline students, faculty, and staff for antisemitic behavior demonstrates a striking lack of accountability on the part of Harvard.

“In front of Congress, when disgraced former Harvard President Claudine Gay failed to denounce antisemitism and calls for genocide, she also claimed ‘disciplinary processes are underway’ against perpetrators of antisemitism,” Stefanik wrote. “This has proven to be false, with Harvard producing no evidence of punishment against those who have committed crimes and violated Harvard’s code of conduct.”

The New York congresswoman, referencing the sharp decrease in early applicants to Harvard since its post-October 7 wave of antisemitism began, wrote that “at a time when support and applications for Harvard have fallen, university leadership has continuously chosen to side with those who hate Jewish students and faculty and failed to keep them safe.”

This particular instance is not the first time Harvard has seemingly stonewalled an investigation. House Education and Workforce Committee chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.) announced in March that the university has not complied with a congressional subpoena ordering the administration to provide documents related to the committee’s investigation into Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on its campus.

“Harvard’s continued failure to satisfy the Committee’s requests is unacceptable,” Foxx wrote at the time. “I will not tolerate delay and defiance of our investigation while Harvard’s Jewish students continue to endure the firestorm of antisemitism that has engulfed its campus.”

Harvard assistant vice president for communications Jonathan Swain told National Review in a statement that the university is intent on fighting antisemitism on its campus.

“Antisemitism has no place in the Harvard community,” Swain wrote. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to combating antisemitism, in whatever form it manifests itself and our ongoing efforts to ensure that Jewish students feel safe, valued, and embraced at Harvard.”

Swain also wrote in his email to NR that the divinity student referenced in Stefanik’s letter “is not scheduled to graduate in May 2024.” Though Swain would not elaborate on that assertion, NR reviewed previous reporting identifying the student as Elon Tettey Tamaklo —based onan FBI report — and Tamaklo’s LinkedIn page, which indicates that he will in fact receive his degree in May 2024.

Title: Stefanik, Blackburn Introduce the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced theDefense Quantum Acceleration Act, legislation that would supercharge the Department of Defense’s (DoD) approach to quantum technology and advance U.S. national security, building on the excellent work done by Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) - Rome, in Rome, New York.

Currently, there are a number of tremendous individual efforts in quantum across the DoD, such as the quantum computing work being done by AFRL-Rome, but these efforts lack a unified effort and focus on transitioning quantum-enhanced capabilities to the warfighter on a relevant timeline.

This bill would establish a framework for the DoD to optimize its approach to the development and transitioning of quantum technology by empowering a Principal Quantum Advisor to the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic quantum roadmap and provide an independent budget assessment of current DoD quantum budgets to Congress. The bill would also authorize a defense quantum technology testbed to enable the Defense Innovation Unit to successfully execute the transition of near-term quantum capabilities using the $55 million of funding it received for this purpose in Fiscal Year 2024.

“I am proud to lead this critical legislation to ensure the United States maintains a quantum technological advantage over our adversaries, including Communist China,”said Representative Stefanik.“Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at Rome Labs, is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members.”

“U.S. advancement of quantum technology is critical for our nation to compete on the global stage, as Communist China has made clear their goal to lead the world in this industry by 2049,”said Senator Blackburn.“This legislation helps ensure the Department of Defense maximizes its developmental resources and capitalizes on the incredible work happening at the local level, including in Chattanooga and Oak Ridge.”

"Congresswoman Stefanik's legislation is critical to our national and economic security, and I applaud her foresight in making applied quantum information sciences a priority for the Department of Defense. Much of the military's pathbreaking work in QIS is led by Rome Labs, whose open innovation? initiatives are performed in our world-leading laboratories at Innovare Advancement Center in Rome, NY, where we embed the nationalquantum workforce strategy into all of our research programs to develop the next generation of quantum scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Today, QIS technology is in the laboratory but tomorrow it will likely be in the battlespace. To prepare for this, the U.S. military must have a robust applied QIS R&D infrastructure and talent pipeline to ensure that we are transitioning advances rapidly from the laboratory to the warfighter. That's precisely what this bill is all about, and I thank Congresswoman Stefanik for introducing it,”said Heather Hage, President and CEO of the Griffiss Institute.

“The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act signifies a critical commitment to leveraging quantum technology to its fullest potential, ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of technological advancement and strategic defense capabilities. Congresswoman Stefanik is providing key leadership in bolstering America’s national defense industry and securing our nation as the global leader in quantum technology,”said Marc P. Christensen, P.E., Ph.D., President of Clarkson University.“Clarkson University is among our nation’s technological institutions advancing quantum capabilities with the Department of Defense through partnerships like the one we have with Rome Labs, as well as defense contractors on all facets of applied research and educating graduates ready to lead industry in advancing these technologies.”

“IBM applauds Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for introducing their Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, which helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the Administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing,”said Chris Padilla, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM.

“Quantum technologies, including computing, sensors, and networking, have the potential to revolutionize national security. The nation that leads in these areas will have a significant military advantage. The Quantum Industry Coalition applauds Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn for recognizing this, and for introducing the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act to help ensure that the United States will be the world quantum leader for years to come,”said Paul Stimers, Executive Director of the Quantum Industry Coalition.

“The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act is landmark legislation. For the first time it makes sure the most important advances in quantum information science, from quantum computing and quantum sensing to the latest developments in quantum communication and hybrid technologies, become part of our national defense arsenal. At a time when our race for quantum supremacy against China is crucial to the security of America, the DQAA will empower the Department of Defense to find the applications of quantum technology that best serve its needs and requirements, today and far into the future,”said Arthur Herman Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute & Director, Quantum Alliance Initiative.

“The field of quantum information science and its applications is a critical area of strategic competition for the United States, and one which the nation cannot afford to lose. Securing a quantum advantage for the warfighter will require a deliberate approach to cultivating these technologies,”said Heather Penney, Senior Fellow at the Air and Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

“PsiQuantum’s mission is to build the world’s first useful quantum computer, and we are grateful for Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn’s continued leadership on quantum technologies,”said Jeremy O’Brien, CEO and Co-Founder of PsiQuantum.“Utility-scale, fault tolerant quantum computing will be a reality much sooner than conventionally predicted, and both Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn have understood this reality for years. The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to capitalize on the unique ways in which fault tolerant quantum computing can help advance national security imperatives, in both the near- and long-term.”

“Quantum information science – and quantum computing in particular – is absolutely crucial to our national and economic security. This bill showcases the U.S.’s strategic vision and leadership that is needed to drive quantum adoption for our nation’s defense and intelligence community,”said Peter Chapman, CEO and President of IonQ.“We believe the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act of 2024 and continued investments by the US Department of Defense in quantum will further accelerate the deployment of transformative computing solutions. We continue to take pride in IonQ’s role as a partner to the U.S. Department of Defense and are excited to support Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn's strategic vision.”

"We applaud Rep. Stefanik for introducing theDefenseQuantum Acceleration Act, a policy that will provide a framework for the Department of Defense and its service branches to identify problems that could be addressed by quantum technologies,”said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave.“Developing and accelerating adoption of quantum and quantum-hybrid applications is critical to achieving mission objectives such as challenges facing the modern battlefield and supply chain logistics. Quantum technologies are advancing at different rates and utilizing the most advanced systems will help achieve an edge in national security.”

"Atom Computing commends Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for spearheading the "Defense Quantum Acceleration Act", empowering the Department of Defense to more effectively organize disparate initiatives and operationalize critical quantum technologies that could enable asymmetric competitive advantage for the warfighter. This legislation will give the Department a strategic role in accelerating utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing for our national security,"said Rob Hays, CEO of Atom Computing.

“As the world’s largest integrated quantum computing company, Quantinuum strongly supports the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act introduced by Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn. Quantum computing is rapidly advancing from the lab to the commercial marketplace and US leadership for this emerging technology will be crucial for economic and national security alike. We believe that the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will supercharge the Department of Defense’s approach to quantum and drive crucial near-term use cases and workforce development across government and industry,”said Ryan McKenney, Director of Government Relations at Quantinuum.

Defense One:New bill would greatly expand Defense Department quantum efforts

By Patrick Tucker

Republican lawmakers will introduce a new bill Wednesday to accelerate the Defense Department’s use of quantum information science, from sensing and navigation to more ambitious goals of quantum computing for advanced artificial intelligence applications.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., will introduce the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act. The legislation would direct the Defense Department to establish a new quantum advisor role and stand up a center of excellence to “explore and identify  [quantum information science] technologies that have demonstrated value in advancing the priorities and missions of the Department,” according to the text of the bill, viewed exclusively by Defense One.

Quantum information science, which takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum mechanics, has many potential defense applications. Information that’s encrypted on the quantum level can’t be secretly intercepted because attempting to measure a quantum property changes it. Quantum sensors can relay information about location, making them a more secure means of navigation than GPS, which can be spoofed. Quantum computers, today in their infancy, could eventually process information exponentially more effectively than conventional computers. The National Academies of Sciences has said “quantum computers are the only known model for computing that could offer exponential speedup over today’s computers.”

But China has outpaced the Defense Department in terms of investment in quantum technology, dedicating $15 billion over the next five years—or $3 billion a year—as opposed to the $700 million yearly Defense Department investment.

The new bill doesn’t push the Defense Department to match China’s numbers, as private companies like IBM, Google, and Lockheed Martin are also heavily spending research and development dollars on next-generation quantum computing. But it does raise the profile of quantum technology within the Defense Department and, theoretically, would allow the Pentagon to start buying more quantum technologies faster, enabling quicker innovation from private companies.

“Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable, and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at [The U.S. Air Force Rome Laboratory in New York] is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members,” Stefanik said in a statement.

The Defense Department already has a director of quantum science in the office of the undersecretary for research and engineering. Under the bill, the newly-established quantum advisor would have a much-expanded role, coordinating with combatant commands on where they might need or use quantum science, coordinating with allies like Australia to share knowledge and best practices, and specifically looking at the challenges the Defense Department faces to determine if quantum information science might help.

The bill would also direct the stand-up of a center to coordinate with businesses and academia and develop prototypes of more near-term quantum technologies for sensing and navigation, in addition to accelerating quantum computing research.

Chris Padilla, vice president of government and regulatory affairs at IBM, applauded the introduction of the act, which he said, “helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing.”

Utica Observer Dispatch:More federal funding boosts 'revolutionary technology' from Rome Lab

By Amy Neff Roth

The Air Force Research Lab in Rome is getting some big investment from the federal government — $415 million in fiscal year 2024, the largest amount of funding ever designated for the lab.

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, visited Rome on April 2 and announced the funding during a press conference at the Griffiss Institute with some local officials.

“This goes toward quantum research,” she said in a statement. “This goes toward cyber. This goes to our Counter-UAS (unmanned aircraft systems). So all the emerging technologies, when we consider future national security challenges, we will be leaders right here in Rome.”

“This is a tremendous endorsement at the national level of the incredible work and the unique work that Rome lab does every single day,” Stefanik continued. “We are not only the leader in New York, the leader in the United States of America, but we are a global leader when it comes to these emerging technologies.”

The funding is a boost to the national defense, lab officials said.

"The Air Force Research Laboratory is fully committed to improving critical warfighting technology that not only boosts the morale and well-being of warfighters in the field but also ensures their success and safety," said Michael Hayduk, deputy director of the AFRL Information Directorate. "The funding we receive from Congress is a testament to the tireless efforts of our skilled and dedicated researchers and scientists. This funding is essential as it helps us to bring revolutionary technology into practical, real-world scenarios, ultimately strengthening our national defense."

Local leaders also stressed that what is good for the lab is good for Rome and Oneida County.

“This investment not only fortifies our nation's defense capabilities, but also underscores the vital economic impact this facility has on our city,” Rome Mayor Jeff Lanigan said in a statement. “Congresswoman Stefanik's support ensures that Rome remains a hub for innovation, driving economic growth for our community.”

The lab has twice been targeted by the Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, process, both in 1995 and 2005. Local officials quickly organized a defensive strategy to keep the lab in Rome, preserve its local jobs and to use the lab to help develop a high-tech ecosystem in the region.

The lab had an estimated economic impact of $501 million in fiscal year 2020 in Oneida, Herkimer, Madison, Onondaga and Oswego counties, according to the lab. That impact included the lab’s workforce of 838 military and civilian employees that year.

“This is wonderful news for our region,” said Heather Hage, President and CEO of Griffiss Institute, in a statement. "Today’s result demonstrates clearly Congress's unwavering, bipartisan support for AFRL's critical mission in defending our nation's security. Rome Lab is the lead agency for the Department of Defense in quantum research and this tremendous increase shows clearly that investments in QIS are a national priority.

“Such extraordinary support from Congress will enable our region to build a robust quantum industry focused on critical national security applications.”

As the most senior New York representative on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on Intelligence, Stefanik was able to secure the funding for the lab with help from local Rep. Brandon Williams, R-Sennett, and other local officials, she said.

Rome does not currently lie within Stefanik’s 21st Congressional District, which includes Herkimer County, part of Otsego County and the North Country. But the state has redrawn the lines for its Congressional districts and in the next election, Stefanik’s district will include Rome and northern Oneida County while southern Oneida County will remain in the 22nd Congressional District, currently represented by Republican Brandon Williams.

Stefanik holds the position of House Republican Conference chair, making her the third highest ranking Republican in the House of Representatives. She is also on former President Donald Trump’s list of potential running mates.

During the press conference, Stefanik also announced legislation that she will be introducing, the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, which she called important for national security and important for Rome and Oneida County.

“This bill will supercharge the (U.S. Departmet of Defense’s) approach to quantum information science,” she said, “and create a framework for reaching the first utility-scale, fault tolerant, quantum computer right here in Rome, New York.”

The $415 million for the lab was appropriated in smaller amounts of between $1 million and $25 million for 40 different areas at the laboratory, including photonic chips for quantum computing, a secure quantum computing facility, the internet of living things ecosystem, unmanned aircraft systems traffic management advanced air mobility enhancements, antenna development for secure communications and networks and B-52 agile pod capability.

“This funding will enhance and support the innovative and critical work, research and development that takes place every day at the lab while strengthening this important military asset,” state Sen. Joseph Griffo, R-Rome, said in a statement. “Oneida County and Rome are proud to host AFRL and all the other defense facilities and research partners that call the region home.”

Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the Biden Administration’s ruling that reduces the amount of milk available to families utilizing the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

“Joe Biden’s WIC restrictions will cause significant negative effects on the health of babies, mothers, and families participating in WIC to access nutritious milk products,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Families are already struggling with skyrocketing prices due to Bidenflation and the Biden Administration’s new rule would limit their access to the healthy milk products our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country work hard to provide to our communities. I will continue to work to ensure our new mothers and developing children have access to nutrient rich milk.”

In March 2023, Congresswoman Stefanik led a bipartisanletterto United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack calling on him to oppose the proposed rulethat would reduce the amount of milk available to WIC families.

Oneida Daily Dispatch:Stefanik visits Rome, announces $415M towards defense research

By Roger Seibert

ROME, N.Y. — U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY-21, visited Rome Labs this past week to announce that she helped secure over $415 million in funding for the Air Force Research Lab in Rome for Fiscal Year 2024.

“I am proud to announce that I secured over $415 million in defense spending for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory in the City of Rome through this year’s appropriations process,” Stefanik said.

Stefanik helped secure the monies through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. The act provides appropriations for various federal departments and agencies for FY2024. The funding amount provides a historic amount of resources for lab and defense technologies research for AFRL Rome.

“This has doubled the previous year’s appropriations bill,” Stefanik said. “This goes towards quantum research, towards cyber, this goes to our counter UAS. So all the emerging technologies, when we consider future national security challenges, we will be the leaders right here in Rome. I am proud to have delivered this significant funding.”

Quantum computing studies the physical limits of information processing. This type of research has advanced many fields of science and industry like chemistry, optimization and molecular simulation.

Drones are a type of Unmanned Aerial System. Counter-UAS technology includes camera systems and specialist drone detection radar along with net guns and cyber takeover systems.

Stefanik said the funding will help Rome “remain a leader” in defense technology research.

“This is a tremendous endorsement at the national level of the incredible work and the unique work that Rome Labs does every single day,” she said. “We’re not only the leader in New York, the leader in the United States of America, but we’re the global leader when it comes to these emerging technologies.”

Stefanik also introduced the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act bill during her visit.

“This bill will supercharge the DoD’s approach to Quantum Information Science and create a framework for reaching the first utility-scale, fault-tolerant, quantum computer right here in Rome, New York. So we want to make sure, when it comes to Quantum, that we continue to be the world leader,” she said. “That’s why I’m introducing this legislation. It’s not only important for national security purposes but also important for right here in Oneida County and right here in Rome.”

The funding will incorporate the most current defense research technologies.

“This funding includes a $25 million investment in the Air Force Research Lab’s annual Future Flag testing and evaluation exercise, which is conducted in Lewis, N.Y., to ensure our service members have access to the best technology possible,” Stefanik said.

Future Flag tests experimental and emerging technology and its uses in tactical situations.

State Sen. Joesph Griffo, R-53, Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente Jr., Rome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan and Griffiss Institute President and CEO Heather Hage joined Stefanik during her visit.

“I’m looking forward to building on these partnerships and looking forward to earning the support from voters in the portions of Oneida County that have been added to my congressional district,” the congresswoman said.

The following key Congressional funding increases for AFRL Rome are as follows:

– photonic chips for quantum computing: $10,000,000.

Title: Stefanik Statement on Biden’s Hamas Appeasement Six Months After Oct. 7 Terrorist Attacks
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement condemning Joe Biden’s abandonment of United States ally Israel just six months following the brutal Hamas terrorist attack.

“It has been six months since Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and brutally murdered, raped, tortured, and kidnapped over a thousand innocent Israeli civilians. Since that day, Israel has been fighting for its right to exist against barbaric Hamas terrorists in Gaza.

“It is unacceptable that instead of showing resolute support for our greatest ally, Joe Biden has chosen to abandon Israel and embrace Hamas terrorists as he desperately tries to appeal to the antisemitic Far Left. There are still over 100 innocent civilians, including Americans, being held by Hamas and we should be doing everything in our power to bring them home. Instead, Joe Biden’s strategy of appeasement continues to embolden our adversaries and abandon Americans and our great ally Israel.”

East Greenbush, N.Y.- House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement demanding New York Judge Juan Merchan recuse himself from President Trump’s trial for his clear judicial bias following the latest unconstitutional gag order.

“Democrat Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan, who donated to Biden’s campaign and another anti-Trump cause in 2020, has a clear judicial bias against President Trump. Merchan’s adult daughter is a Democrat political operative who has financially benefited from her father’s unprecedented trial of President Trump. When Trump raised this additional evidence of Judge Merchan’s bias, Merchan retaliated by expanding his unconstitutional gag order on Trump.

The law and common sense absolutely requires Judge Merchan’s recusal from President Trump’s trial.

We cannot allow a biased, far-left activist judge to strip the American people of our constitutional right to select their own leaders.”

Sun Community News:Stefanik blasts border policies after Champlain visit

CHAMPLAIN | On April 3, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik visited the Champlain Port of Entry and Border Patrol facility to hear directly from Border Patrol Agents about the crisis at the Northern Border and see the impact of the unprecedented surge of illegal crossings at the Swanton Sector.

Congresswoman Stefanik met with the U.S. Border Patrol’s Swanton Sector Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia to discuss the unprecedented number of illegal crossings at the Northern Border. She also met with Acting Area Port Director Todd Bulson to discuss the staff shortage affecting U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) ability to operate effectively and efficiently.

After the visit, Stefanik issued the following statement, which read in full:

“I had the opportunity to see firsthand how our brave Border Patrol agents and CBP officers are working hard to keep our communities safe from the invasion of illegal immigrants flooding into our state because of Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Kathy Hochul’s failed Far Left open border policies. The Swanton Sector Border Patrol had more illegal immigrant apprehensions in FY23 than the previous 11 fiscal years combined because of these failed Far Left open border policies. It is abundantly clear that our brave Border Patrol and CBP agents are in desperate need of more resources and support. While Far Left Democrats continue to incentivize this crisis they created, Republicans are fighting to secure our border and ensure our agents and officers have the resources they need to keep us safe.”

National Border Patrol Council Local 2724 President Brandon Budlong said “Congresswoman Stefanik’s steadfast support of our members and national security is greatly appreciated. The crisis at our border isn’t just at the southern border. It’s at the northern border as well.”

In May 2023, Congresswoman Stefanik voted to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, which would increase the number of Border Patrol agents, provide effective border enforcement technology, resume construction of the border wall, strengthen the asylum process, and end the administration’s catch and release policy.

In March, the U.S. Border Patrol Swanton Sector said its northern New York and Vermont coverage area caught an unprecedented number in Fiscal Year 2023- more than the previous 11 years combined. During the first four months of Fiscal Year 2024, Swanton Sector has made twice as many apprehensions than in the early 2023 surge.

And the experience that we have advocating for Fort Drum, advocating for other military partnerships and defense partnerships throughout Upstate New York and the North Country, it fits into a very strong ecosystem that your local leadership in Oneida County are building right now.

I also want to thank the Rome Mayor, Jeff Lanigan, I’m looking forward to working closely with him. I want to thank our local leadership, from the Central New York Defense Alliance who has been a tremendous partner over many years as we’ve worked to deliver results to this community in the National Defense Authorization Act and the Appropriations bill. I also want to note that we worked very closely with your current member of Congress, Brandon Williams, who worked to ensure that we were able to deliver these results, partnering in the appropriations process and then in my seat on the House Armed Services Committee.

This is a tremendous investment that I’m proud to announce for the region, doubling the previous year's investment and we just passed the Appropriations bill which was signed into law and I'm proud to announce over 415 million dollars total for Fiscal Year 2024 for theAir Force Research Lab. This goes towards quantum research. This goes towards cyber. This goes to our Counter-UAS. So all the emerging technologies, when we consider future national security challenges we will be the leaders right here in Rome. And I am proud to have delivered that significant funding working with Brandon Williams, working with our local elected officials, and utilizing my seat on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Intelligence Committee to get that done. This is a tremendous endorsement at the national level of the incredible work and the unique work that Rome lab does every single day. We are not only the leader in New York, the leader in the United States of America but we are a global leader when it comes to these emerging technologies.

And that’s why I am excited to announce one of the new pieces of legislation that I am introducing right here in Rome, it's called the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act. And this bill will supercharge the DoD’s approach to Quantum Information Science and create a framework for reaching the firstfirst utility-scale, fault tolerant, quantum computer right here in Rome, New York.

Press Republican:Federal funding increases in appropriations bill stands to benefit Beta

By Carly Newton

PLATTSBURGH — Beta Technologies looks to benefit from an increased pool of funding thanks to the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, which passed the House Friday and was signed into law by President Joe Biden Saturday.

“This is a big win,” NY-21 Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville), who voted to approve and secure the funding, told the Press-Republican Monday.

These federal funds will specifically provide an additional $20 million support for the Department of Defense’s Agility Prime Program that Beta — an electric aerospace manufacturer that performs cutting edge critical cargo, military and medical missions and has operated on the flight line of Plattsburgh International Airport since 2017 — has participated in since 2020.

It has not been made clear yet how much of the $20 million increase in funding will eventually be made available to Beta.

Jake Goldman, a spokesperson for BETA Technologies, said over the past several years, Beta has worked hand-in-hand with several U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) services through the Agility Prime Program with a focus on “demonstrating the electric aviation’s ability to close real mission sets at a lower cost for our nation’s military.”

“Since the onset of our participation in the program, BETA has reached several key milestones in electric aviation, many of which have occurred at our flight test center in Plattsburgh,” Goldman said.

“Programs like Agility Prime are critical to ensuring companies like BETA can continue progressing electric aviation toward domestic manufacturing and operations, which will translate to reduced dependence on foreign technologies and more robust capabilities.”

Beta has continued to be on the receiving end of funding opportunities in recent months.

In December of 2023, Beta announced they would be embarking, in partnership with Clinton County, on a $41 million expansion of its operation at PBG that will lead to more jobs and a brighter era of aerospace technology; $20 million of that $41 million cost is coming from the Empire State Development’s Regional Economic and Community Assistance Program through the county.

Stefanik, who visited Beta recently, is confident this increase in funding for the program will continue to make sure that Plattsburgh is making inroads and growing its defense manufacturing sector in Clinton County.

She said she keeps in touch with all the manufacturers across the district, particularly those that are looking to grow and is always looking to help support them.

“We oftentimes highlight the strength of our workforce, the other defense manufacturing companies locally and have successfully supported these manufacturing opportunities for growth in Clinton County, and we stay in close touch, not only with the North Country Chamber of Commerce and Garry Douglas, but with other economic development leaders in the region.”

Chairperson of the Clinton County Legislature, Mark Henry, (R-Area 3, Chazy) also welcomed news of the increased funding.

“Today, we extend our gratitude to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik for her unwavering commitment to our community’s economic development and national security,” Henry said.

“With her advocacy, this $20 million for the Air Force’s Agility Prime program will bolster the pioneering efforts of Beta Technologies at the Plattsburgh International Airport, owned and operated by Clinton County. Congresswoman Stefanik’s dedication to securing these funds not only underscores her steadfast support for our region but also highlights her tireless efforts in advancing cutting-edge innovation and job creation. We thank her for her leadership and partnership in helping to propel Clinton County forward into a future defined by technological excellence and economic prosperity.”

BORDER AGENTS

As part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, millions of dollars will also go toward funding 22,000 Border Patrol agents.

This is the highest number ever funded, Stefanik said.

“This is significant, because as we have seen, our northern border patrol officers have been transferred over and over again to the southern border at the start of this catastrophic border crisis, which, I believe, is a result of Joe Biden’s failed policies, but that has left our northern region without the personnel that we’ve needed,” she said.

“And we’ve seen an over 800% increase in illegal crossings in the last year alone.”

The funding in the appropriations bill will ensure a higher number of border patrol agents at both the southern and northern border.

“Clearly, this is top of the mind for every American,” Stefanik said.

“The border crisis is having an impact on our national security, our economy and our community safety. So this is a win in the sense that it fully funds 22,000 Border Patrol agents … So that means we’ll be able to address some of the personnel challenges that have existed the past couple of years.”

ESSEX COUNTY

The appropriations bill will also be giving a $25 million funding increase to the Air Force Research Lab in Rome for its annual Future Flag testing and evaluation exercise, which is conducted in the Town of Lewis in Essex County.

“They have the old missile silos, and I’ve been there myself with the developer and entrepreneur who purchased that site and over the past decade, we have really worked to highlight these national defense and national security assets in the North Country,” Stefanik said.

“We have very strong national defense partnerships from Lewis, New York in Essex County to Rome to Fort Drum to, of course, the former Plattsburgh Air Force Base and the defense manufacturers in the Clinton County community.”

Watertown Daily Times:D.C. finalizes federal budget: Defense spending up 3% with investments at Fort Drum, military pay raises

By Alex Gault

WASHINGTON — The final portion of the 2024 federal budget has been signed into law, almost seven months late, and that portion includes some key investments for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division.

On Saturday, President Joseph R. Biden signed the last fiscal year 2024 appropriations package, which allocates $1.2 trillion in money that will fund the federal government until September, when the fiscal year ends.

The first package was approved earlier in March, allocating $459 billion. The package signed into law Saturday funds the annual defense budget, federal financial services, homeland security, health and human services, and other topics that were more difficult to negotiate than the first package.

While the federal defense budget increased by 3% under the now largely complete 2024 federal budget, domestic spending in other categories has been kept essentially flat.

The 2024 Defense Appropriations Act approves a total of $825 billion in total funding — as has happened annually for years, this year’s package is the largest yearly defense budget in U.S. history.

That includes a 5.2% pay increase for service members, the largest single boost to base military pay since 2002, and millions of dollars dedicated to affordability programs targeted to lower earners in the enlisted ranks. The U.S. Department of Defense has $10 million to address food insecurity among the ranks, $167 million for DOD-managed child care programs, including an expansion to their universal pre-kindergarten pilot program.

$50 million will be put into the Defense Community Infrastructure Program that provides grants to communities hosting military posts in the U.S., and another $265 million will be added to the millions already spent on chemical cleanup operations, especially focused on PFAS which have been found at Fort Drum and most other military posts.

According to Rep. Elise M. Stefanik, R-Willsboro, a senior member of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, $45 million in funding from that package is allocated to projects and investments that Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division will benefit from.

“This critical funding will go towards upgrading equipment and fielding infantry units,” she said in a statement. “As our nation faces significant threats at home and abroad, it has never been more important to ensure funding for the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed military unit in the US Army since 9/11, and Fort Drum to support our service members and bolster our military preparedness.”

Stefanik pointed to the $10 million allocated to accelerate funding to Army unmanned aircraft systems for light infantry units, including the 10th Mountain Division. Another $15 million will go to bolster Army radio systems used on posts for emergency response and on-base security, and $10 million was allocated to the 10th Mountain Division engineer for land surveying equipment used for reconnaissance, obstacle reporting and construction.

And more money is set aside for the potential East Coast missile defense site that DOD officials have preliminarily agreed to build at Fort Drum. While DOD officials have expressed muted interest, if any at all, in building such a system, and have said they would likely reevaluate potential sites for the system if they do begin building it later on, Stefanik has pushed for more and more direct support for a site at Fort Drum in every budget process for the last few years.

This year, $11 million has been allocated for DOD-wide planning and design for the Missile Defense Agency, and $10 million has been allocated for development at Fort Drum.

In a statement shared with the Times by Stefanik’s office, David J. Zembiec, chair of Advocate Drum, said the defense funding package makes important investments in Fort Drum.

“This funding expands Fort Drum’s capabilities and mission readiness, which certainly enhance(s) its military value to the Army and DOD, thereby helping to ensure its continued presence here in the north country,” he said.

Biden signing this package of federal spending bills into law formally ends this year’s fraught budget fight, where conservative Republicans in the House have held up the final budget for nearly seven months. The final package, called an “omnibus” for combining six different appropriations bills into one, got mixed support among Republicans when they voted on it Friday.

Rep. Claudia L. Tenney, R-Cleveland, voted against the package, calling it “wasteful government spending.” Tenney, who has positioned herself as both a conservative and a moderate among Republicans in the House this year, said there were inclusions in the package she found completely unnecessary, while it also failed to address some key issues.

Tenney pointed to a number of small projects funded by the omnibus funding package, as well as continued support of abortion and birth control through the VA, as key points of dissent. She also said she was concerned that the bill didn’t make meaningful steps in “reining in” federal regulation of firearms.

At the same time, Tenney lauded the bill for including a handful of infrastructure investments for her home district, including a $750,000 grant to help the town of Watertown with its Army Water Line Pipeline Replacement Project, and a $1 million grant to help the city of Watertown with its water quality improvement project.

“This 1,050-page spending monstrosity does not provide the relief that the American people are demanding and will only increase already sky-high prices and add to our national debt,” Tenney said in a statement Friday. “There are positive aspects of this bill, including the 12 community funding projects we submitted to help residents of NY-24. Other positives include fully funding veterans’ health care and toxic exposure programs, military construction projects and important agricultural research programs, but this bill in its entirety, negotiated behind closed doors, is a bridge too far.”

Title: Stefanik Advocates for Medicare Advantage Program Servicing Over 2 Million New Yorkers
Date: 2024

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Representative Nick Langworthy (R-NY) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in support of the Medicare Advantage program.

Stefanik and Langworthy asked that the 2025 Medicare Advantage Final Rate notice accurately reflect the increases in healthcare costs to protect the program and make sure the millions of seniors in New York who rely on Medicare Advantage for access to high-quality, affordable care and supplemental benefits are adequately covered.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“We write on behalf of over 33 million Americans and more than 2 million New Yorkers to express our support for the Medicare Advantage program and ask the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to bring stability to seniors in 2025 through a rate environment in the Calendar Year 2025 Final Rate Notice that accounts for increases in utilization and rising inflation.”

The lawmakers continue,“CMS’s projections for growth and utilization trends are inconsistent with the experience of providers, utilization patterns of beneficiaries and inflation. A survey shows that 90 percent of providers are seeing an increased demand in utilization of health services. External sources including the Congressional Budget Office and CMS’s own Office of the Actuary report higher growth estimates. It is critically important that the final rates reflect the most recent available data with respect to utilization and costs. As such, we ask that the Administration ensure that the 2025 Medicare Advantage Final Rate Notice accurately reflects increases in health care utilization and costs to give Medicare Advantage seniors the peace of mind that the high-quality, affordable care and additional benefits they rely on in Medicare Advantage will be around for years to come.”

Title: Stefanik, Langworthy, Kelly, and Zinke Lead Letter to Mayorkas on Spike in Northern Border Apprehensions
Date: 2024

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.– Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Representatives Nick Langworthy (R-NY), Mike Kelly (R-PA), and Ryan Zinke (R-MT) to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas concerning the spike in apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the Northern Border.

Stefanik and the members of Congress contend that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, in the previous Fiscal Year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 10,021 aliens illegally crossing the border between ports of entry, while there have already been 4,772 apprehensions in the first four months of the current Fiscal Year.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“In the first four months of FY 2024, through January 2024, the Border Patrol has already apprehended 4,772 subjects along the Northern Border, a 114% increase from the first four months of FY 2023.2 This 114% increase in apprehensions is unsustainable and symptomatic of your broader failure to secure the border.”

The lawmakers continue,“More alarmingly, the surge of Terrorist Screening Data Set (TSDS) encounters at the Northern Border continue to skyrocket. Through the first four months of FY 2024, there have been 103 encounters with individuals at ports of entry at the Northern Border, compared to just eight at Southwest Border ports of entry.5 This is not a new phenomenon, in FY 2023, the Northern Border had 484 TSDS encounters at ports of entry, compared to 80 at the Southwest Border. In FY 2022, the Northern Border had 313 while the Southwest border had 67. Dangerous individuals continue to take advantage of the vast Northern Border, which is the longest land border between two countries in the world, and relatively unguarded by natural barriers.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Advocates for Her Bill, the V-SAFE Act, Before the Veterans’ Affairs Committee
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington,D.C.- In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik addressed the members of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations to discuss her billthe Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion (V-SAFE) Actwhich would prevent our veterans from falling victim to fraudulent attacks that endanger them and their livelihoods.

Congresswoman Stefanik also questioned John W. Boerstler, Chief Veterans Experience Officer at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, about the importance of passingV-SAFEto help implement a one-stop-shop for veterans to go in times of crisis.

Watch her full remarks here.

Read a full transcript and her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Thank you, Chairwoman Kiggans for the opportunity to join the VA Committee today for this important legislative hearing. And while I do not serve on this committee, this hearing, as all VA hearings are critical for veterans both across my district in New York 21, home to the largest number of veterans in New York state, and across this country. My bill is one of the bills under discussion today and it addresses a matter that affects all our nation's veterans: the rise of fraud and scams targeting those who have bravely served our country.

The statistics are staggering, and we’ve worked with many constituents who have faced these frauds and scams. According to the FTC, over 74,000 military retirees and veterans reported instances of fraud or identity theft in 2023 alone, resulting in a collective loss of $350 million hard earned dollars. These scams came in various forms, including fake debt collectors, credit card fraud, benefits fraud, and fake job opportunities, just to name a few. Criminals often exploit veterans' trust by impersonating government officials or representatives of well-known financial institutions making it difficult for our veterans to discern the truth from deceit.

We must act to better protect our veterans against these malicious actors. That is why I introduced the bipartisan Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Act known as the V-SAFE Act. And I appreciate those supportive comments, Mr. Boerstler. This significant bill aims to permanently establish an office within the VA dedicated to leading all fraud prevention efforts.

Currently, the VA lacks a centralized approach codified in law to combat fraud with various offices operating in a decentralized manner. My V-SAFE Act bill will rectify this by providing oversight and coordination of all fraud prevention efforts within the VA ensuring these activities are coordinated across the entire department.

My bipartisan bill, H.R. 6452, the V-SAFE Act, represents a crucial step towards safeguarding our nation's veterans from fraudulent activities. By codifying into law, a dedicated organization within the VA and fostering collaboration across government agencies, we can and we will better protect those who have sacrificed so much for our country. I thank the Chair for holding this hearing and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill as we work it through the legislative process, through the Committee and on the Floor.

My question is for you Mr. Boerstler.Can you tell me why the V-SAFE Act that I’ve introduced, why it’s important to have a one-stop-shop for veterans where they can go to in times of crisis as they are facing this unprecedented threat of frauds and scams?”

John W. Boerstler, Chief Veterans Experience Officer, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs:“Well, yes, and thank you Congresswoman for your support and for introducing the bill. I think it’s incredibly important for many different reasons and the $350 million metric you mentioned a second ago, that’s just what has gone reported. We have no idea how many more millions have impacted our military or veterans and families so we do need a centralized effort here, not only within the Department of Veterans’ Affairs but within the broader federal landscape. Because there are many different agencies that have enforcement authorities and reporting authorities. We want that one central phone number for veterans and their families to call. One website to go to so that they can not only identify ways to protect themselves against different scam and fraud efforts, but also report these efforts so that we could track them down and prevent it from happening to other veterans and families.

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Well, thank you. Thank you for your support of the legislation. I know you have some recommendations from the VA. We look forward to working with you on some of those recommendations as we move this process forward.”

The Troy Record:Stefanik touts $4.2M in funding for Rensselaer County infrastructure projects

By Erica Bouska

RENSSELAER COUNTY, N.Y. — As a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Rensselaer County will receive $2.5 million for sewer service and infrastructure expansion and nearly $1.7 million for a well water supply project in the Town of Poestenkill.

U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Saratoga Springs, secured the funding through work with local leaders like Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin.

“The taxpayers’ the ones paying the bills so when we can get Congressional representation that recognizes that as well and helps us help the people, that’s Elise’s goal, that’s my goal,” McLaughlin said. “Big thank you to Elise for helping us out.”

He said the $2.5 million is earmarked for a couple of projects, including the seven miles of extended water and sewer lines on Route 9 in Schodack and the Poestenkill project and will join the already designated American Rescue Act Funds from the county. Regardless of where it goes, McLaughlin said it will be well spent.

Stefanik said it was a multi-month process to secure the funding, having to move the Rensselaer County application through the committees and appropriations process, but it was an important win for the district. Stefanik said it was a “very localized” approach and they worked closely with McLaughlin and the county legislature.

“They’re significant investments when it comes to our local communities,” Stefanik said. “I work for the people of my district and we’ve been able to deliver, over time, hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into upstate New York and the North County.”

Stefanik said sewer infrastructure and expansion was a top priority that McLaughlin, town supervisors, and other local officials brought up. The projects will not only expand the pipes — by about 10 miles total for just Scodack and Poestenkill, McLaughlin said — but improve the system in general and help prevent any pipe failure or release of treated sewage into the surrounding environment, she said.

Infrastructure has been a large part of McLaughlin’s work as county executive and when speaking about this project, he compared it to the “Field of Dreams”: if you build it they will come. They have the borrowing power, he said, but why increase debt when you don’t have to?

When they put this money up front for infrastructure, he continued, they know they’ll get it all back through revenue growth and economic vitality. This fund is a huge plus for the county, he said, and called it “very impactful” and “pretty transformational.”

“This is a real win, this $2.5 million,” Stefanik said. “This has been a team effort and it’s an example of the results we’re able to deliver.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions Commander of NORTHCOM on the Need for a Third Homeland Missile Defense Site at Fort Drum
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. - In case you missed it, the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee held a hearing to receive testimony on the FY25 Strategic Forces Posture. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik questioned Commander of NORTHCOM General Guillot on the strategic need for a third homeland missile defense site at the Department of Defense’s chosen East Coast location of Fort Drum, New York.

Stefanik also asked about the role of the New York Air National Guard’s 109th Airlift Wing in competing with our adversaries in the Arctic.

Watch her full line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“General Guillot, as ballistic missile threats from North Korea and Iran continue to advance, do you believe that it would be strategically worthwhile to construct a third homeland missile defense site at the DoD and Congress’s chosen East Coast location at Fort Drum, New York?”

General Guillot:“Congresswoman, I’m aware that there was a recent assessment that said that such a site was not an operational necessity. However as an operational commander that watches very closely the advances that our adversaries are making, primarily Iran and even more so North Korea, I think that it’s important for me, as the commander, to have continually assessed the threat and see if there are any changes in the threat environment that would necessitate additional capabilities to affect the homeland.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“General, in my office when you were kind enough to visit, you said it would be strategically worthwhile and you supported the construction. I understand the assessment process, but as you and I spoke in my office you said that this would be strategically worthwhile particularly as we’re considering threats not just of today but of the future as well.”

General Guillot:“Yes, Congresswoman, if the assessment came back that those threats - I thought it would be worthwhile to build that site, a site.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“What would an operational requirement for a third homeland missile defense site look like?”

General Guillot:“Congresswoman, that would depend on the threat, but I think dispersal away from the sites that we have now so that we don’t have all of our proverbial eggs in one basket would be very important. And the other would be to make sure that it is located somewhere in the continental United States where it would have the kinematic responsiveness to intercept threats that are coming from a different avenue.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And Fort Drum meets those requirements… That’s the DoD’s position, that's Congress’s position that Fort Drum is in fact the location of a potential East Coast missile defense site. You are aware of that.”

General Guillot:“I am aware of that, yes ma’am.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And it meets those requirements.”

General Guillot:“It does. I think I’m answering a different question. With future capabilities that we may have, I think we would have to assess that, but based on the previous, yes, I know that Fort Drum was the primary location.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Great.And you understand if and when Congress establishes a requirement for a third homeland missile defense site on the East Coast, you understand that it’s the DoD’s responsibility to execute that requirement?”

General Guillot:“I would be the strongest advocate to execute that requirement if the threat required it. Yes, ma’am.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And then shifting gears here, Upstate New York, in addition to being home to Fort Drum in my district, we also are home to another key Arctic unit: the New York Air National Guard’s 109th Airlift Wing. The 109th Airlift Wing operates the LC-130Hs or known as the ‘Ski Birds.’ These planes, as you know, are the only platform in the world that can provide critical logistical support in and around the Arctic, yet they are at the very end of their operational capability. Do you believe that the LC-130s have enabled the U.S. to maintain a strategic presence and lead in the Arctic?”

General Guillot:“Congresswoman, yes, without a doubt, and in fact just this past week they were in our AOR up at Arctic Edge and Ice Camp Operation performing that unique capability.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“We believe, and this is a bipartisan issue for members of the New York delegation, I just authored a letter with my colleague Paul Tonko, so bipartisan support, about the urgent need for their recapitalization, so I would refer you to that, we’ll make sure your office has a copy of that, but that’s very important to maintain our leadership, strategically, in the Arctic region.”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: We Need To Unleash American Energy Not Restrict It
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to kick off Energy Week. She highlighted House Republicans' commitment to restoring American energy dominance and ending Joe Biden's unprecedented war on American energy, which has caused energy prices to skyrocket.

Watch her full remarks here.

Find her full remarks below:

“Good morning. Americans have had enough of Joe Biden and Far Left Democrats’ anti-American energy policies.

Since his first day in office, Joe Biden has destroyed American energy independence. He canceled the Keystone Pipeline killing thousands of jobs and launched an unprecedented war on American energy. Joe Biden has forced America to rely on foreign adversaries, like Russia and Iran, and left American families to foot the bill for skyrocketing energy costs due to this unwanted, Far-Left Agenda.

From the gas station to the grocery store, American families are hurting. Gas prices are once again on the rise. And in my district in Upstate New York, which relies heavily on home heating oil, sky-high utility and heating costs are crushing families, increasing by over 80 percent in the last three years.

Joe Biden created this energy crisis, and the American people know it.

Republicans know that we need to unleash American energy, not restrict it. It’s vital that we ensure America's energy dominance and provide true energy security. That is what we are focused on for Energy Week in the House.

We’ve seen it firsthand, under the pro-American energy policies of President Donald Trump, we were the world energy leader. Our nation thrived because of the pro-national security, pro-American job energy agenda that lowered costs and prioritized domestic production.

Today we are joined by our colleagues Congressman Dan Newhouse who is leading the resolution denouncing all of the anti-American energy policies of the Joe Biden, and we also have Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger whose work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee is fighting back against these anti-American energy proposals from Joe Biden.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Joe Biden’s Gas Powered Vehicle Ban
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. --House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement calling for Joe Biden to reverse his decision to phase out gas-powered vehicles in an effort to push American consumers to electric vehicles.

“Joe Biden’s ban of gas-powered vehicles is the most recent and most extreme example of Far-Left Democrats crushing hardworking American families. Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are pushing their radical agenda onto the American people and threatening our economic security in the process. We’ve already seen the disastrous consequences of similar policies in Democrat led New York, resulting in higher prices and a lack of access that leaves behind people like my constituents in rural Upstate New York and the North Country. Joe Biden should learn from Kathy Hochul’s failures and reverse his decision to phase out the gas-powered vehicles many Americans depend on.”

Title: Stefanik’s CCP Drones Act and FACT Act Advance through E&C Committee Following Markup
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, the bipartisanCountering CCP Drones Actand the bipartisanForeign Adversary Communications Transparency (FACT) Actintroduced by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik advanced through the House Energy and Commerce Committeeunanimously. Passage during today’s markup sets these bills up for consideration on the House floor.

“The advancement of my bipartisan bills, the Countering CCP Drones Act and the FACT Act is a win for America’s national security and a win for Americans whose data and critical infrastructure has been collected and monitored by our adversary Communist China. Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop Communist China’s monopolistic control over the drone market and telecommunications infrastructure and build up America’s industrial capacity,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“Based on DJI’s ties to the CCP, the Administration has shown that DJI is a threat to our national security and has already placed the company on multiple government entity lists. Our legislation will further protect our communications equipment while strengthening American supply chains by ensuring foreign-manufactured technologies that pose serious security threats, such as DJI’s, cannot operate in American networks,”said Ranking Member of the Select Committee on the CCP Raja Krishnamoorthi.

“DJI has supplied the surveillance State that is subjecting Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples to genocide. It is high time that the U.S. government ensures that Americans and law enforcement agencies are protected from both complicity in human rights atrocities, and from having their data in the hands of the Chinese State. We are grateful to Representative Stefanik and her colleagues for spearheading efforts to have DJI added to the FCC covered list,"said Omer Kanat, Executive Director, Uyghur Human Rights Project.

TheCountering CCP Drones Actintroduced with Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Mike Gallagher would add Chinese drone company Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) to the FCC Covered List, meaning that DJI technologies would be prohibited from operating on U.S. communications infrastructure.

TheForeign Adversary Communications Transparency (FACT) Actintroduced alongside Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) would counter the influence of China and other foreign adversaries on the United States’ telecommunications infrastructure. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has introduced a companion in the Senate.

Title: Stefanik, Tonko Advocate for Updating New York Air National Guard’s Planes
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) led a bipartisanletterwith members from the New York congressional delegation urging Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin to immediately update the New York Air National Guard’s LC-130H “Skibird” planes which are the only planes in the world that provide strategic airlift capability in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Updating the New York Air National Guard’s LC-130Hs is essential to the mission of the 109th Airlift Wing which operates out of Stratton Air National Guard Base.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“We write with deep concern regarding the United States’ ability to maintain a strategic presence in the Arctic and Antarctic regions due to the aging LC-130 Hercules (LC-130H) fleet. The LC-130Hs, operated by the New York Air National Guard’s 109th Airlift Wing, are the only platform in the world that can provide critical logistical support in the Arctic and Antarctica, yet these planes are reaching the end of their operational capacity, and the Department of Defense is not acting with the necessary urgency to recapitalize these planes.”

The lawmakers continue,“As Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continue to advance their interests in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, it is critical that the United States maintain a robust presence in these regions…Increasing tensions, emerging capabilities, and global instability have opened the polar regions to be the next theaters for great power competition and the United States must be prepared to counter and deter this threat. This will require consistent and persistent U.S. presence in the North and South poles. To accomplish this, the United States relies solely on the LC-130H aircraft to transport equipment and supplies to within the polar regions.”

Reps. Stefanik and Tonko were joined by Tenney, Lawler, Williams, Malliotakis, D’Esposito, Garbarino, Lalota, Morelle, Ryan, Molinaro, and Langworthy.

Title: Stefanik Accepts “Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Defender of Israel Award” at ZOA Gala
Date: 2024

Content:
Davie, FL- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik was honored with the “Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Defender of Israel Award” at the Zionist Organization of America’s “Heroes of Israel” gala where she also delivered remarks. Dr. Miriam Adelson presented Congresswoman Stefanik with the award.

Excerpts of Dr. Miriam Adelson's remarks:

"Luckily for us all, his [Sheldon] spirit lives on in the real American leaders of today. Several have graced us with their participation this evening, and it is my special pleasure that I bestow upon one of them, Representative Elise Stefanik, the ZOA Award.

The ZOA award which carries my name and that of my beloved late husband Sheldon. There are many occasions on which I wish Sheldon was standing beside me — this is one of them. Another was a few months back when I watched with delight as Representative Stefanik exposed the hypocrisy of the presidents of allegedly elite universities who had allowed antisemitism on their campuses.

She followed up by demanding transparency over the degree to which even a regime has been buying influence over American colleges and although some so-called “Middle East experts” are advising U.S. decision makers, she wants American tax dollars to fund American needs and interests and not the enemies of peace like Iran or UNRWA.

Along with millions of others, I recognized immediately that this is a young woman, very young, with the mettle of generations past, the vision to spot injustice, and the courage to call it out, the ability to rise to the moral challenges of a fast changing world.

To Sheldon, Representative Stefanik would have been a perfect example of his favorite axiom, “Stand up for what you believe in, even if you stand up alone.”

But Congresswoman Elise, you will never stand alone. I thank you. The ZOA thanks you. The Jewish people thank you. America thanks you. Mazel Tov — and may you know much success."

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik's remarks as prepared below:

“Good Evening!

Thank you, Dr. Miriam Adelson for that kind introduction.

You are an incredible, steadfast supporter of the Jewish state of Israel, the ZOA, the Jewish people, and critically important global medical research.

As a dedicated and committed physician, philanthropist, humanitarian, and businesswoman, Dr. Adelson, you are a titan both here in the United States and in Israel.

We grow stronger from your strength and we watch in awe as you open up your heart through your work across our communities.

It is truly a tremendous honor to be with you today and it is incredibly humbling to accept the Defender of Israel Award from Dr. Adelson.

Thank you to ZOA - Your tireless efforts have such a positive impact here at home, in Israel, and around the world.

Tonight’s gala comes at an incredibly challenging moment in time.

From the October 7th terrorist attacks against Israel, to the ongoing war against Hamas, to the appalling rise of antisemitism here in the United States and around the world, to Joe Biden’s and Chuck Schumer’s unconscionable actions and words that undermine the Israeli war effort...

Our most precious ally Israel and the Jewish people are in need of crucial support from the grassroots level all the way up to the highest levels of government.

Your voices at ZOA are powerful and a vital part of the conversation and your work has a lasting impact.

The attacks on October 7th truly shocked the conscience of the world, marking the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

As the atrocities and barbaric images came to light and were shared in the days and weeks after, my heart broke as a wife, mother, daughter, sister, and proud American.

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, I believed it was important for fellow Members of Congress to understand the depths of depravity and brutality perpetrated by Hamas, and I encouraged the Speaker of the House to show Members of Congress the video provided by the Israeli Embassy documenting this barbarism.

I joined many of my colleagues to watch the 40-minute video footage of the unfathomable brutality committed by the hands of Hamas terrorists against Israelis.

As a mother, wife, sister, and daughter, I - like many in the audience - sobbed. It shocked my soul.

These horrific images of atrocities are etched into my memory forever.

We mourn together for the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and children including babies who were tortured, raped, killed, kidnapped, and over 100 hostages including women, children, and Americans - who are still being held in Gaza by these evil terrorists.

This gut wrenching footage of PURE EVIL is a stark reminder that Israel is currently fighting not only for its right to exist but for the rights of Jewish people everywhere.

That is why I am committed today and will always be committed to supporting Israel’s right to defend itself from all acts of violence and I will continue to stand with Israel to ensure they have the resources it needs in this darkest hour.

Earlier this month, I met with Mia Schem and her mother and brother.

Mia was taken hostage on October 7th and her best friend was murdered.

Mia was held hostage by herself for fifty-four days where she was subjected to unspeakable horror.

By the grace of God, Mia was released.

Her bravery in the face of unspeakable terror, her belief in herself, and her unyielding determination and will to live reminds us all that we must do everything we can to free the remaining hostages so they can return to their families after five excruciating months.

We are committed to ensuring Israel must have the resources they need to complete this imperative military mission.

Additionally, this past week, I hosted Ambassador Herzog at the Annual House Republican Retreat in West Virginia to give an update on the war effort to destroy Hamas, highlight the hostages who are still being held in Gaza, and make the case for much needed military aid currently being held up by Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden.

Minutes before the Ambassador’s address, we heard Chuck Schumer’s disgraceful attacks that undermined Israel and were a boon to the Iranian regime.

House Republicans strongly condemned Schumer's unacceptable statement.

Unfortunately, Joe Biden praised Schumer’s speech, rather than condemned it.

Instead of meddling in Israel’s sovereign elections, Chuck Schumer should follow House Republicans’ lead in supporting our most precious ally in her darkest hour.

Over the last few months, House Republicans have passed bipartisan resolutions in support of Israel, called out antisemitism in the halls of Congress, and brought transparency to the antisemitic propaganda pushed on American students and paid for by our foreign adversaries.

We have passed an Israel aid package, without any conditions, now sitting with the Senate, and we’ve successfully passed bills like the DETERRENT Act to ensure our foreign enemies cannot rot the minds of American students.

We must prioritize the vital funding Israel needs now, especially as it remains entrenched in a war with Hamas and facing rising threats from Hezbollah and Iran.

House Republicans will use every tool we have to deliver critical aid to Israel.

The October 7th atrocities also exposed a rise in antisemitism in our nation and across the world.

From radical antisemitic student groups at Harvard blaming Israel for the October 7th attacks to pro-Hamas perpetrators trapping Jewish students in a library at Cooper Union in New York, it is clear that vile antisemitism has spread across our country - specifically our universities.

In the famous words of Holocaust Survivor and Jewish Advocate Simon Wiesenthal, who dedicated his life to ensuring the horrors of the Holocaust are not forgotten, he said, “For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing.”

For me, the choice is clear. I refuse to do nothing.

Israel and the Jewish people hold a very special place in my heart.

I grew up in Upstate NY and attended an all girls day school right next door to a synagogue. I had many very close Jewish friends as a child, as I do today.

From growing up attending bat and bar mitzvahs to joining families at their homes for Shabbat dinner to attending Shabbat dinner at Harvard Hillel, to celebrating brises for friends' sons, to signing the ketubah at a friend's wedding, my love and respect for the Jewish people is lifelong and deep.

I have been to Israel many times - even before I was a Member of Congress. My first trip to Israel was as an undergraduate when I was selected as a fellow for the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies for two weeks of national security studies.

And I have been many times since - returning as a Member of Congress most recently in May of last year to help lead an Intelligence Committee delegation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.

Each of these visits to Israel underscores to me the fundamental facts:

Israel is a miracle.

Israel is foundational to the United States and the American Dream.

In Congress, I serve as a senior Member on the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees where I work each year to secure policies that further develop our special relationship and alliance including securing hundreds of millions of dollars for the Iron Dome, anti-tunneling technology, counter-UAS systems, and further development of emerging technology.

In addition, I am also a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee.

When we heard from Jewish students, faculty members, and staff about antisemitic attacks taking place on their campuses, I encouraged Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx to host a hearing to hold colleges and universities accountable for their failure to protect the Jewish community.

I know you all saw that hearing — but the world saw that hearing.

And I want to take you into that moment. That question that was just played here, that was the last question of the hearing. The most junior member on the committee yielded me her remaining three minutes. And I had asked questions earlier in the hearing going back and forth with the president of Harvard, now former President Claudine Gay, and I had struggled to get a direct answer.

So in preparing the final question, which was not pre-written — I wrote it down with a pencil right before and thought to myself, “how can I ask this in a straightforward, moral way to force them to answer correctly?”

And that question was — “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct?”

And one after the other, after the other answered “It depends on the context.” Let me tell you — it does NOT depend on the context.

Those morally bankrupt statements–and I’ve been in a lot of committee hearings over the years, a lot of high profile committee hearings over the years–I’ve never witnessed the moral depravity of witnesses like I did in that hearing. In one week, there were over one billion views worldwide. It is not well into the multiple billions. And there is a reason that it is now the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress.

And that is because it exposed the moral rot at the highest levels of these so-called elite universities. And as I said after the resignations: two down, so many to go.

That hearing set off an earthquake.

We have put colleges and universities on notice and we are continuing our investigation to ensure every Jewish and Israeli student, faculty member, and staff member is protected on campus.

The problem was never just about three university presidents or even these three universities. It is a vile pervasive rot in American higher education.

Their disgraceful attempt to contextualize genocide of Jews is a symptom of decades of moral decay, intellectual laziness, and dangerous radical groupthink at so called “elite” institutions across society.

Replacing the wallpaper is not enough when there is a deep rot within the walls.

The Education and the Workforce Committee has dedicated investigators and resources to deliver transparency and accountability.

We’re looking at foreign donations to universities, the failure to protect Jewish students, the federal accreditation system, the assault on viewpoint diversity and free speech, the antisemitism inherent in woke DEI, the erosion in academic integrity, and the extent to which taxpayers have been forced to bankroll the political indoctrination of young Americans at these institutions.

Importantly, the committee has taken the unprecedented step of subpoenaing Harvard, the first university to be subpoenaed by the committee in history and in a few short weeks we will have the leadership of Columbia University brought before us for our next oversight hearing.

I will continue to help lead this fight to combat the scourge of antisemitism across this country.

Anyone that does not stand with our ally Israel, stands for their genocide.

Any campus leader that refuses to protect Jewish students, stands with the pro-Hamas criminals who harass and assault them.

Any voice that openly defends the massacre of innocents has chosen the side of terrorism.

And they will be held accountable.

The world must know the United States stands with Israel today, tomorrow, and forever.

Thank you and God Bless you, God Bless Israel, and God Bless the United States of America.”

Utica Observer Dispatch:Millions in federal funding is coming to Herkimer County. How will the money be spent?

By Amy Neff Roth

When President Joe Biden signed a bill on March 9 to prevent a partial federal government shutdown, he also accelerated the timetable of a project in Herkimer County.

The $460 billion package of six annual spending bills included millions for community projects across the country, including $2.75 million for a proposed children’s center in Herkimer County. That money, on top of other grants, was enough to move the project forward.

The Herkimer County Legislative Board voted 10-5 Wednesday evening to authorize construction of the 14,000-to-16,000-square-foot center on part of the former Duofold site in Ilion that is currently across Spruce Street from the main Duofold building.

This artist's rendering shows the concept of the Herkimer County children's center that will be built in Ilion. The building has not yet been designed so its final appearance is still uncertain.

“We’re ecstatic,” county Administrator Jim Wallace said of the federal funding. It was the last thing needed for legislators to put construction to a vote, he said.

….

Federal funding

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, whose sprawling district covers Herkimer County and the North Country, sent out a statement on Tuesday touting the $30 million in funding in the bill to benefit projects she supported in her district as well as other causes in the bill that she says will benefit upstate New York.

She called the funding for the children’s center a “huge win and result for Herkimer County.”

In discussions with county leaders, child care kept coming up as the top issue, one that presents challenges to employers whose workers need it, Stefanik said. That’s why she chose to back the project for funding, she said.

In putting in applications for community projects to receive federal funding, Stefanik makes sure to back one project in each county that is most desired by local officials, she said.

Stefanik also supported another project in the county to mitigate flooding in Herkimer. The appropriations bill contained two grants for New York State to be used to fund efforts by the village of Herkimer to widen Bellinger Brook to prevent flooding and to repair and reconstruct parts of the West German Street bridge over the brook.

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik at House Republican Annual Issues Conference: House Republicans Are The Final Line Of Defense Against Joe Biden

Content:
White Sulphur Springs, WV –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined House Republican leadership to kick off the second day of the House Republican Annual Issues Conference and highlight how House Republicans are working hard to protect the American people from Joe Biden’s failed Far Left policies and restore the American dream.

Watch her full remarks here.

Find her full remarks below:

“Good morning everyone! Welcome to day two of the House Republican Annual Issues Conference.Yesterday, we discussed the political landscape and growing our House Republican Majority. Today, we are focused on covering the key issues facing communities across the country.

The American people understand that Joe Biden continues to turn his back on We the People. Joe Biden’s failed State of the Union address exposed an unfit leader promoting his failed Far Left policies that are leaving Americans behind creating crisis after crisis.

A case in point: Joe Biden apologized for using the term ‘illegal’ to describe the illegal immigrant who murdered Laken Riley, a young innocent nursing student. Yet, Joe Biden couldn't even pronounce her name correctly. As a mother and as a conservative leader myself, this leaves me speechless. Joe Biden clearly could care less about how his policies are destroying American families and creating a crisis across our country.

Under just three years of Joe Biden’s Far Left leadership, our nation has faced crisis after crisis. American families are forced to make hard decisions between putting food on the table or gas in the tank due to the highest inflation in my generation’s lifetime. Violent crime is destroying our cities, and open borders is allowing millions of illegal immigrants to invade our country, bringing illicit fentanyl and crime to our streets.

Because of the unified and disciplined messaging of this Republican Conference with all the members of our Conference, we have held Joe Biden’s Administration accountable for his failed policies. And we have driven Joe Biden’s poll numbers on the key issues facing hard-working Americans. Whether it’s immigration, the economy, crime, and national security, those poll numbers have plummeted. Unlike Joe Biden, the House Republican Conference is committed to delivering commonsense solutions that bring results to the American people.

We are the final line of defense to protect American people’s freedoms, secure our border, and restore the American dream.”

This is vital, as non-native invasive animal and plant species cost the United States over $100 billion every year.

In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states,“As Co-chair of the Congressional Invasive Species Caucus, I remain committed to preserving our cherished environments and combating harmful invasive species that threaten wildlife habitats. Having a space for our communities and visitors in the North Country to learn about the restoration of Lake Champlain and its watershed, as well as the threat of invasive species, would help facilitate more informed and involved communities.”

Stefanik continues,“The Lake Champlain Basin Program and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission are uniquely qualified to provide opportunities for students, residents, and visitors to learn more via exhibits, hands-on activities, events, and educational programs for all ages. I urge you to partner with our North Country community by establishing a space for all to learn, engage, and actively participate in ensuring our ecosystems are preserved for years to come.”

Title: Stefanik Statement On Schumer Calling For New Elections In Israel
Date: 2024

Content:
White Sulphur Springs, WV –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement following Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s comments calling for new elections in Israel.

“October 7th was the deadliest day in history for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Today House Republicans hosted Ambassador Herzog at our House Republican Issues Conference to give an update on the war effort to destroy Hamas, highlight that hostages are still being held in Gaza, and make the case for much needed military aid currently being held up by Democrats led by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer.

Israel is not only fighting for its right to exist, it’s fighting for the rights of Jewish people everywhere.

Instead of meddling in Israeli sovereign elections,Chuck Schumer should follow House Republicans’ lead in supporting our most precious ally in their darkest hour.

Chuck Schumer’s disgusting comments undermine Israel, are a boon to the Iranian regime, and is nothing short of turning our backs on Israel. House Republicans will continue to stand strongly with our most precious ally Israel.”

Fox News:Stefanik rips Obama AG Loretta Lynch over lobbying gig for Chinese military company

By Elizabeth Elkind

House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is criticizing former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for reportedly lobbying the Pentagon on behalf of a company known as DJI, which makesChinese militarytech.

"It is disgraceful but unsurprising that Barack Obama’s former Attorney GeneralLoretta Lynchis now working on behalf of a Communist Chinese drone company that the Department of Defense has identified as a Chinese military company," Stefanik told Fox News Digital.

"Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is lobbying the DOD to request they remove DJI from this list so the Communist Chinese company can operate with impunity in America. U.S. government officials, both past and present, should be working to ban these Communist Chinese spy drones and bolster the domestic drone industry, not advocating on behalf of a Chinese military company and theChinese Communist Party."

Lynch, who served under former President Barack Obama, is now a partner at law firm Paul, Weiss. She specializes in congressional investigations and national security, among other issues, according to her webpage on the company site.

Stefanik’s comments come after a report earlier this week suggested Lynch could be leveraging her government connections to aid a Chinese government-linked company.

Reuters reportedthat she wrote a letter to the Pentagon last summer on behalf of one of her clients, SZ DJI Technology Co., asking for them to be removed from the DOD's list of Chinese military companies.

Fox News Digital reached out to Paul, Weiss and the Pentagon for confirmation.

The report noted that it’s legal for lawyers to advocate for foreign clients without mandatory public disclosure of their work.

DJI is one of the largest producers of drones in the world. The U.S. Treasury placed investment restrictions on it in December 2021, accusing it and seven other companies of actively supporting surveillance and repression efforts against Uyghurs.

Meanwhile, in Congress, a House GOP-led effort could restrict DJI’s activity in the U.S. even further. Stefanik and House China select Committee Chair Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., are leading a bill called the Countering CCP Drones Act, which would block federal offices and agencies from buying or using drones made by a foreign adversary like Russia, China or Iran.

White Sulphur Springs, WV –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik kicked off the House Republican Annual Issues Conference with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) to discuss the historic opportunity before House Republicans to save America and the American dream from the failed Far Left policies of Joe Biden.

Watch her full remarks here.

Find her full remarks below:

“Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the House Republican Conference Annual Issues Conference Retreat in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which is proudly represented by Congresswoman Carol Miller who will be welcoming all the House Republicans here today. This is an opportunity for House Republican Members to continue our planning and work for our legislative agenda for the House Republican Majority especially as we head into a historic November election. This is a working retreat where we will hear updated polling presentations. We will be hosting special guests like Israeli Ambassador Herzog and member discussions on economic, pro-family, and national defense policies.

No matter where you go across the country, whether it’s in Upstate NY in my district or in West Virginia right here, it is clear that hardworking American families are struggling due to the crises Joe Biden’s failed policies have created. The Biden border crisis continues to rage. Painful Bidenflation hurts small businesses, farms, and hardworking families and our precious allies like Israel are under attack.

These failed Far Left policies of Joe Biden are in clear contrast to Republicans’ Commitment To America. Republicans are proudly the party of hardworking Americans, law enforcement, veterans, small businesses, farmers, families, seniors, and we are proudly the party of parents. It's why you’re seeing President Trump and Republicans across the country gain record support from working class voters as well as Black and Latino voters.

We are in the midst of a historic opportunity to save America, to save the American dream. Because the American people are fed up with the Extreme Democrat Far Left agenda led by Joe Biden that is responsible for skyrocketing Bidenflation, the Biden border catastrophe, surging violent crime, and a world in chaos. The American people are ready for strong America First leadership by President Trump in the White House, a Republican Senate, and a strong Republican Majority as we pick up seats this November in the House.

And to discuss further is our chair of the NRCC who is doing an incredible job recruiting strong candidates to go on offense, to grow our House Republican majority, that’s my friend Richard Hudson from North Carolina.”

Title: ICYMI: The Daily Gazette: Fulton County Secures $2M for Great Sacandaga Lake Sewer Project
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– In case you missed it, today,The Daily Gazettereported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik secured $2 million in funding for a Consolidated Regional Sewer System Project in Fulton County through theConsolidated Appropriations Act. This funding will be used to establish a new sewer district to provide modern resilient wastewater infrastructure and prevent older and failing structures from negatively impacting the water quality of nearby surface water bodies and groundwater.

The Daily Gazette:Fulton County secures $2M for Great Sacandaga Lake sewer project

By Tyler A. McNeil

Fulton County’s priciest water infrastructure project is getting a seven-figure boost in funding.

As part of a federal appropriations bundle signed by President Joe Biden, the county will receive an additional $2 million to build a centralized sewer system around the Great Sacandaga Lake region.

U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Saratoga, helped earmark the project.

“As we look across the district for infrastructure needs, the sewer investments are very important and they are just in need in rural communities across the country,” Stefanik told the Daily Gazette Family of Newspapers.

To extend sewer pipelines from Gloversville to Mayfield, it’s expected to cost more than $8 million. To extend the system all the way to Northville — the county’s long-range goal — costs are estimated to number $30 million.

Officials in Johnstown last year applied for funding closer to $10 million, according to county Administrator Jon Stead.

“The way they do things and the way they spread the funding across the entire state of New York, double-digit millions are not likely in this program,” Stead said. “We’re very happy and the $2 million is a very nice feature.”

So far, phase one funding has been covered by COVID-19 relief funds. Using the rest of that funding line, the county Board of Supervisors on Monday OK’d three contracts to begin construction.

ManFred Construction, the main contractor, hopes to commence construction in the late spring and finish at any point between June and November, according to Fulton County Planning Department Director Scott Henze.

“When we met with them, we talked about the project, how they were going to phase it and they seemed eager and gung-ho to start laying the pipes from Gloversville to Mayfield,” Henze said.

Henze expects that recent federal appropriations could help cover some of the costs of inching closer to Lanzi’s Lakeside Tavern & Marina on state Highway 30. Roughly each mile costs $1 million.

“As long as we’re utilizing it on the Route 30 sewer project — I mean, we have quite a few miles to go to get from Mayfield to Northville,” Henze said.

In order to start, the county has to receive approval from Glove Cities, which together operate the Gloversville-Johnstown Joint Wastewater Treatment Facility. Two weeks ago, both cities sent a letter to the county requesting contractual changes.

Johnstown Mayor Amy Praught has made clear that she will throw her weight behind any final agreement until the county alters the language of the contract.

“I’m waiting’” she said. “It’s in their hands. I can’t do anything.”

Stead is hoping that both Johnstown’s attorney, Michael Albanse, and the county’s attorney, Jason Brott, will soon meet to discuss technical changes.

“It’s really mostly wording changes and wordsmithing from what I see and so they’re going to be talking about in the next week or so,” Stead said. “Hopefully, within two weeks, that’ll be signed, sealed and delivered.”

Adirondack Daily Enterprise:$4.5M for Saranac Lake emergency complex

By Aaron Marbone

SARANAC LAKE — The project to build a new emergency services building for fire, ambulance and police responders in Saranac Lake got a $4.5 million boost from the federal government over the weekend after Congress passed a consolidated appropriations act with the funding request submitted by North Country Rep. Elise Stefanik. President Joe Biden signed the package through on Saturday.

“This is a significant result for Saranac Lake,” Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, told the Enterprise on Monday.

Mayor Jimmy Williams said he was “ecstatic” to learn the award was funded.

“Pretty awesome, right?” Williams said on Monday. “This is the biggest chunk (of money) we’ve gotten so far.”

There’s still a lot to be fleshed out in terms of the project itself, Williams added, but this money increases its likelihood of successful completion. He said the village is seeking out every funding opportunity for the estimated $27.5 million project.

“The price tag is enormous. It is scary for all of us,” Williams said. “But it’s got to be done, so we’ve got to figure out a way to do it.”

Saranac Lake Volunteer Fire Department Chief Brendan Keough said he was “quite excited” about the funding, adding that it is a “big step” in the ongoing process. The full work to find enough funding for the project will take years, he said.

Trustee Matt Scollin, an ex-officio member of the village’s Emergency Services Building Committee, said he’s “very appreciative” for the grant and said it brings them closer to making the project a reality.

“Obviously, it doesn’t get us all of the way there, but this is real momentum, this is real energy,” Scollin said.

Keough said they are “super-grateful” for Stefanik’s efforts.

“She has been a very good advocate and a very good listener for emergency services,” he said.

Stefanik said she first learned about Saranac Lake’s need for updated emergency facilities at the 2022 Winter Carnival Gala Parade. On that day, she said Keough waved her down and requested a visit to discuss federal funding for the project. Keough said he’s known Stefanik for years and they have a good working relationship.

Three months later, she toured the fire hall with local officials.

“It was clear how important it is,” she said on Monday. “They just needed a new building with a significant, significant investment.”

Local elected leaders put together a proposal for community project funding and Stefanik submitted it as a line item in this appropriations bill. She said it was funded for the full amount it could have been and she’s proud of that.

“It’s one of the largest line item(s) for community project funding,” Stefanik said.

Stefanik claimed the state of New York was “clearly” not supporting the first responders, and unable to get funds elsewhere, so she delivered for them. The village has not sought state grants yet, but will in the future.

“Without additional funding sources, federal or state … there’s no way that this project would even be possible,” Keough said.

Scollin said the village is going to “shake every tree” they can.

The village is waiting on a contract from the entity dispersing the $4.5 million funds, Williams said, so he’s currently unsure how soon it will be available and what specifically it should be spent on. For now, he said he’s just happy it got approved.

“Stefanik has made multiple personal visits to Saranac Lake’s current emergency services facilities,” Willams said in a statement. “From the outset, she recognized the dire conditions and committed to doing everything in her power to help. … We are grateful for the congresswoman’s follow-through on the promise she made to our local heroes and the community they serve 24/7/365.”

The fire department has been looking for a new home since 1971, and the police department building fails every inspection it gets.

State of the project

–

In December, the village purchased a 15.089-acre parcel at 33 Petrova Ave. containing the former St. Pius X High School for $350,000 with the goal of building a colocated fire, ambulance and police complex there. Currently, the fire and rescue departments are at 100 Broadway and the police station is at 1-3 Main St.

But this plan to move the three departments to Petrova has been controversial with neighbors and some village residents.

A group of neighbors who live near the proposed site, other community members and at least one member of the village board feel the village could fit the joint building — or at least the fire and rescue squads — in their existing location at 100 Broadway. The rest of the board, the project engineers and the fire chief disagree and see moving to 33 Petrova as their only option. This disagreement has been at an impasse for months, and members of the public still feel their questions have not been answered.

On Monday, the village board considered a resolution that would allow the engineering firm Wendel Five Bugles Design to further investigate the 100 Broadway idea, after persistent requests from the public and some board members for more data on the 100 Broadway site.

Williams said this could cost up to $10,000 to do.

According to Williams, if the village doesn’t go any further with Wendel, it would still pay this amount. But if it moves forward with Wendel, they could use this money as a “credit” toward engineering work at whichever site if they chose to build at.

Two years ago, the previous village board approved a $2.5 million reserve fund set aside for the emergency services building. So far, the village has spent $165,000 on additional land behind the firehall, $40,000 for the feasibility study and less than $5,000 for a historical study. With the $350,000 purchase of the Petrova Avenue land in December, the village has spent just under a quarter of that fund.

–

The larger bill

–

Stefanik said this appropriations bill contained several “key Conservative wins,” including a 10%, $1 billion, funding cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, a $977 million cut from the Department of Justice and a 6% reduction in funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

“The FBI has been weaponized,” she said.

She pointed to the 2018 Schoharie limousine crash, which killed 20 people, as an example of the FBI’s “politicization.” She said the FBI refused to do a review until she questioned its director, adding that the owner of the limo company was a longtime FBI informant.

“So, yes, the FBI’s budget needs to be cut. They are being politicized,” she said.

She also said prohibiting the Department of Veterans Affairs from submitting a veteran or beneficiary’s name to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System list without a judge’s consent was a win.

“With this bill, House Republicans are slashing wasteful spending and limiting Joe Biden’s overreach into the lives of hardworking taxpayers,” Stefanik said in a statement.

Stefanik supported the 7% funding cut to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which she said targets law-abiding gunowners with a “bloated bureaucracy.” The ATF are regulators going after gun retailers, which she called “wasteful spending.”

Locally, she also was encouraged by $10 million to start planning and design for a third homeland missile defense interceptor site at Fort Drum in Watertown.

The federal government is facing another funding deadline in two weeks with the Defense, State and Homeland Security budgets. Stefanik promised to work for strong conservative wins while advocating for the needs of her district.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions FBI Director Chris Wray on If There Is An Ongoing Counterintelligence Investigation into President Trump or Biden and More
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray during HPSCI’s Annual Threat Assessment hearing on whether a counterintelligence investigations into either presidential candidates is ongoing, if he was aware of an audio recording of Joe Biden telling his ghostwriter that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” Biden’s mishandling of classified information, and the national security threat TikTok presents. FBI Director Wray repeatedly dodged Congresswoman Stefanik’s questions.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Director Wray, have you read Robert Hur’s special counsel report?

Christopher Wray, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation:“I have reviewed it.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Do you believe Joe Biden mishandled classified information?”

Mr. Wray:“I’m not gonna discuss the report. That’s the Special Counsel’s report, and I’ll refer to him.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“In your opinion, as director of the FBI, do you believe he mishandled classified information?

Mr. Wray:“Again, I'm just going to refer to the report and the Special Counsel can speak for himself on his report.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Are you aware, and this is breaking news right now, are you aware that there is an audio recording of Joe Biden saying to his ghost writer, in February ‘I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.’ Are you aware of that audio recording?”

Mr. Wray:“Again I would just, respectfully refer you to the Special Counsel.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“No, I’m asking you: Are you aware as the director of the FBI? You’re either aware or you’re not.”

Mr. Wray:“Am I aware of what now?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Whether the audio exists of Joe Biden saying in February 2017, ‘I just found all the classified stuff downstairs,’ to his ghostwriter.”

Mr. Wray:“Again, I’m just gonna refer to the Special Council, and his testimony, and his report.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“It sounds like you might be aware of it then. In front of this very committee, in an open session, your predecessor Jim Comey testified that he did not follow the proper protocol regarding the notification of Congress of the opening of the crossfire hurricane that will be the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump in 2016. To address this illegal abuse of power by the FBI, this committee included direction to the FBI in the IAA requiring notification to Congressional leadership of any counterintel investigation into a federal candidate for office. Is there any counterintelligence investigation into either Joe Biden or Donald Trump?”

Mr. Wray:“I would just say I’ll refer you to the Special Council.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“That is not a question about the Special Counsel. That is a requirement of the IAA of the FBI. Is there a counterintelligence investigation into either Joe Biden or Donald Trump?”

Mr. Wray:“There is no investigation that I can confirm here, no.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Is there a counterintelligence investigation?”

Wray: “Again, I’m not confirming any investigation into either candidate.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:Are you aware that you’re required by the IAA to notify Congress of any counterintelligence investigation?

Mr. Wray:“And we will comply with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Have you already complied with the law? Has there been a notification?”

Mr. Wray:“I believe we have been in compliance with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“You believe you have been or has there been a notification to Congress of any counterintelligence investigation of a federal candidate?”

Mr. Wray:“I believe we have complied with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “Has there been a counter-intel assessment conducted on either President Biden or President Trump?”

Mr. Wray:“Again, there's no assessment that I would confirm here in any way. I believe we have been in compliance with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“How about on an immediate family member and by that I mean spouses or children of either President Biden or President Trump?”

Mr. Wray:“Again, I’m not in the business of confirming, especially not at an open hearing assessments or anything like that when it comes to counterintelligence matters.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“So you will confirm in a classified setting when we ask you this question of whether there is a counterintelligence investigation because you are aware that according to the IAA, you were required by law to notify Congress of any counterintelligence investigation, not just for Presidential candidates but any federal candidate?”

Mr. Wray:“We will comply with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “So you will answer this in a classified hearing later today?”

Mr. Wray:“We will comply with the law.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And what’s your understanding of the law?”

Mr. Wray:“There is a whole series of oversight requirements that we have related to counterintelligence matters. I'm not going to try to go through all of them.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“But specifically the notification of Congress of the counter-intel investigation on to a federal candidate, how do you, what is your understanding of the law?”

Mr. Wray:“Again, I would want to refer to the lawyers to make sure that I’m appropriately complying with it but can tell you we're going to comply with the law. My understanding is that we have been.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Is your assessment that you’re required to notify Congress of any counter-intel investigation into any federal candidate?”

Mr. Wray:“I would again I'm going to defer to the lawyers as to the precision of that.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“You’re the director of the FBI. They report to you. What is your understanding of the requirement in the IAA?”

Mr. Wray:“We’re going to comply with the law including whatever’s in the IAA.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“I want to turn to the search warrants and the search in one case of Mar-a-Lago, an unprecedented raid and a search working with Joe Biden’s legal team. Were you or your staff, did you have any communication about either the execution of the search warrant on Mar-a-Lago or the search of documents working with Joe Biden's lawyer? Was there any communication with Joe Biden of you or your team?”

Mr. Wray:“Not to my knowledge.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“With any White House staff?”

Mr. Wray:“By me or my team?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“By you or a personnel at the FBI.”

Mr. Wray:“Again I want to make sure I’ve got your question right. By me or my staff with who about which?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“With the White House staff about the execution of the search warrant on Mar-a-Lago or the search working with Joe Biden’s lawyers of classified information.”

Mr. Wray:“Not to my knowledge.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“What about the attorney general?”

Mr. Wray:“I can’t speak for the attorney general.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“No, was there any communication with your staff with the attorney general or you regarding the execution of the search warrant or the search of Joe Biden’s classified documents?”

Mr. Wray:“Well, any search would be done in coordination with the Department of Justice. As to whom may have communicated with whom in the FBI, the department, that I can’t.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“I'm asking if you communicated?”

Mr. Wray:“Whether I communicated?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“With the attorney general prior or after the execution of the search warrant on Mar-a-Lago.”

Mr. Wray:“No.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Do you think it is a national…”

Mr. Wray:“Hold on, prior or after?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Prior or after.”

Mr. Wray:“Well, I would've had conversations with the Attorney General about the appointment at that time of Mr. Lausch.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And what were those conversations?”

Mr. Wray:“Just about the fact that he was going to be named. That’s not really about the search itself I suppose.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And my last question is do you think it is a national security threat to have a federal campaign account on TikTok?”

Mr. Wray:“Well, I have been very clear about my views about TikTok and the national security concerns it presents. And we banned TikTok on all FBI devices. As to what campaigns choose to do with their platforms, I’ll leave that to them.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“So you don’t think it's a national security threat?”

Mr. Wray:“I'm not weighing in on that.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“As the Director of the FBI. I agree with you that TikTok is a national security threat. I think it’s a national security threat to have campaign accounts on TikTok. You cannot say here today that you think that’s a national security threat?”

Mr. Wray:“I think TikTok represents all sorts of national security threats. As to whether specific account holders choose to exercise their right to access a TikTok account I’ll leave that to them.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Well we have a disagreement. I think it's a national security threat to have a presidential campaign on TikTok.”

Tens of thousands of my constituents proudly support maple weekends across our district with their families by visiting local farms, sampling a variety of maple products, and attending nearby pancake breakfasts featuring delicious maple syrup from our NY-21 maple producers.

Agriculture is truly the backbone of our Upstate economy and we are proud that New York is the second highest producing state of maple syrup in the nation. In fact, the North Country is home to two of the top three highest producing counties for maple syrup in the state: Clinton and St. Lawrence counties. Our dedicated maple producers - most of them family owned and operated - work incredibly hard to provide delicious products and support our region’s economy.

As the proud Representative of New York’s 21st Congressional District, one of my top priorities is to advocate and support our farmers, including our hardworking maple producers. I am working tirelessly in Congress to help craft a Farm Bill that meets the needs of our farmers and producers. Over the last year, I have hosted listening sessions throughout my district to hear directly from our farmers and producers about their priorities and concerns so that I can elevate them to the highest levels.

In my Farm Bill listening sessions, producers reiterated the importance of supporting specialty crops, including the maple industry. I am working hard to reauthorize funding for the Acer Access and Development Program in this year’s Farm Bill, a crucial competitive grant program for NY-21’s maple industry. I have remained a constant champion of the Acer Access and Development Program, requesting robust funding through Congress’s annual appropriations process to secure research and education resources for the maple industry at institutions such as Cornell University.

I cosponsor the bipartisan Supporting All Producers (SAP) Act to require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to consult with maple producers on where to focus annual research and education priorities via the Acer Access and Development Program. Our maple producers know the needs of the maple industry best and this legislation, which the New York Farm Bureau and the New York State Maple Association supports, would help ensure the Acer Access and Development Program’s resources are used effectively.

North Country Now:Congresswoman Stefanik helps secure $1.8 million grant for Massena water project

By Jeff Chudzinski

MASSENA -- The South Raquette Water District is now fully funded after federal officials awarded the town a $1.8 million USDA grant.

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and federal partners played a crucial role in securing the fund that has put the project over the finish line.

"This is a big result that we have delivered to the people of Massena. Bringing clean water and improving infrastructure is a top priority for the members of my district," Stefanik told North Country This Week.

Stefanik said she was able to shepherd the application through the appropriations committee, fast tracking the funds that will allow the project to commence construction this summer.

"I heard from numerous constituents who raised a number of concerns about the quality of their drinking water. Public hearings were held for them to voice their concerns and we knew this was a top priority," she said.

Through cooperation with local and state officials, Stefanik said the many moving parts came together to deliver the funds for Massena.

"This isn't just an investment in infrastructure, this is an investment in the people of Massena. Infrastructure has been a top priority for some time and I am able to offer assistance in a very targeted way, whether it be for water projects, sewer projects or supporting our first responders," Stefanik said.

Stefanik said throughout the course of her decade in Congress she has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to her district to improve infrastructure.

"We will continue to focus on water and sewer projects, assisting first responders and improving rural healthcare. With grant funding, community funding and community support we can continue to deliver results for NY-21," she said.

Stefanik said she is proud to deliver results for her constituents and will continue her work to bring funding to NY-21 for such projects.

"These projects are critical to the people of NY-21 and I plan to continue to deliver results to our communities," she said.

The South Raquette Water District is expected to cost $9 million and will be paid for with a combination of federal grants and a zero interest loan.

"The Town of Massena is very pleased to be awarded funding through the office of the House of Representatives’ Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to help offset the costs of our planned Water District Development Project. For some time, many of the residents on the South Racquette Road have voiced an interest in obtaining municipal water for their homes. At public hearings, residents have expressed their frustration of using well water that causes accelerated deterioration of their home appliances and stains on their clothes, even when using the expensive water softening systems,” Town Supervisor Sue Bellor said.

Along with the $1.8 million USDA grant, the town of Massena was also awarded $4.5 million on Feb. 23 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law General Supplement grant program.

A $4.27 million zero interest loan with a 30-year term rounds out the funding.

According to Barton & Loguidice Senior Associate Matthew Cooper, 161 equivalent dwelling units will be serviced by the new water district.

Title: House Republican Leadership Statement on Biden’s Budget
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, and Majority Whip Emmer released the following statement regarding the release of Joe Biden’s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2025:

“The price tag of President Biden’s proposed budget is yet another glaring reminder of this Administration’s insatiable appetite for reckless spending and the Democrats’ disregard for fiscal responsibility. Biden’s budget doesn’t just miss the mark — it is a roadmap to accelerate America’s decline.

“While hardworking Americans struggle with crushing inflation and mounting national debt, the President would increase their pain to spend trillions of additional taxpayer dollars to advance his left-wing agenda.

“House Republicans reject Biden’s misguided budget proposal and have taken action to steer our nation back to a path of fiscal sanity. Our efforts to rein in the runaway spending spree from last year's budget have already yielded results, lowering projected deficits by $2.6 trillion over the next decade. The House’s budget plan for the next fiscal year, preceding the President’s proposal, reflects the values of hardworking Americans who know that in tough economic times, fiscal discipline is non-negotiable. House Republicans understand the American people expect and deserve nothing less from their government.”

On Joe Biden’s Final SOTU Address:

“Stefanik said in an interview after the event that she was disappointed, saying Biden’s speech was the most partisan, least effective State of the Union address she had ever seen.

“This was a failed president, with a failed record, and the White House desperately wanted this to be a reset,” Stefanik said.

She said the members of her party shared her surprise at the partisan nature of the speech, and found only one redeeming point in the entire address.”

On Democrats’ Inaction at the Border:

“She reiterated she could not support the bipartisan border bill Biden spoke of, and said it was a “non-starter.” She said the only path to action on the border would be for the president and Senate Democrats to support the House Republican border bill, which is much more conservative, restricting the asylum process, expanding surveillance to freeze migration and cracking down on the existing undocumented population, as well as building another 900 miles of border wall.”

On the Northern Border Crisis:

“In recent years the Northern border has become a popular entry point for illegal border crossings.

St. Lawrence County Sheriff Rick Engle said he’s working with border agencies to bring transparency to just how serious the problem has become.

Stefanik pointed to a recent report which states the Swanton sector, that includes St. Lawrence County, has seen an 846% increase in illegal crossings since October and more illegal crossings in January than the previous 12 January.”

On Joe Biden’s Failed Leadership:

“Joe Biden is a deteriorating president and under his failed Far Left leadership the State of the Union is in crisis. His desperate attempt at a reset dismisses the everyday struggles of Americans suffering because of his failed policies. Under just three years of Joe Biden, our nation has experienced one crisis after another from the Biden Border Crisis which has devastated American communities, to weakness on the world stage, and the highest inflation in my lifetime. Because of Joe Biden’s radical agenda, we have faced violent crime in our communities, sky high energy prices, and the weaponization of our Government against us with the Biden DOJ targeting Catholics, gun owners, conservatives, and even parents at school board meetings.

“It is time to return to the America First policies that gave us a secure border, energy independence, peace through strength, and a roaring economy that created 7 million new jobs and allowed our communities to flourish.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Calls Out DEI Offices' Failure to Protect Jewish Students on College Campuses
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– In case you missed it, today, the House Education and the Workforce Committee Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development held a hearing on the negative impact of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies and practices on college campuses.

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik questioned witnesses about DEI offices at elite universities, including Harvard University, failing to adequately address the concerns of Jewish students regarding the rise of antisemitism on their campuses.

Watch her full line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Dr. Goldfarb, in our on-going investigation of higher ed institutions and the increase of antisemitism that is on display at Harvard, Penn, MIT–the three schools we had here–but beyond that throughout colleges and universities, one theme that is very concerning to me is the offices of DEI on these campuses are inherently antisemitic and I’ll give you an example from my alma mater Harvard. Even prior to the October 7th Hamas attacks against Israel and the failure of Harvard’s leadership to protect Jewish students on campus, hundreds of Jewish students reached out to Harvard’s office of DEI raising concerns about the rise of antisemitism, and they did not even receive a single response from the office of DEI. So can you comment? I know that you’ve watched, as a former dean of Penn’s med school you watch what’s happening on that campus. But can you talk to me about how all these offices of DEI fuel this increase in antisemitism.”

Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, Chair, Do No Harm, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania:“Yeah, you know, we’ve written about it and Dr. Greene here has write about it quite extensively as well. I think the point is that once you start dealing with this identity politics, once you start thinking about people as members of groups, he’s pointed out how Jews suddenly become the oppressor simply because of their prominence in these academic institutions. Once identity politics takes over, then one of the natural consequences of it is divisiveness and antagonism between groups because now we’re putting people into these groups. Yascha Mounk has recently written about this in his book, The Identity Trap, and points out, as a man of the Left, what a great concern this is for American life. And I think what we’re seeing in the antisemitism that’s really sprung up terribly in the last few months has been the natural outcome of thinking about people as members of groups rather than thinking about people as individuals. And I think in medical school, in colleges, and in undergraduates, that’s what we’re seeing. I think that these students have decided, that are parading and demonstrating this antisemitic sentiment, they see the Jewish students as members of a group, not as individuals, not as their friends, not as co-students, but as members of a group. And once you go down that path, this is the consequence of it. This is why it’s so divisive in America.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And Dr. Greene, would you like to answer the question as well?”

Dr. Jay Greene, Senior Research Fellow, The Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy, Fayetteville, Arkansas:“Sure, I agree entirely with Dr. Goldfarb’s comments and just say that we systematically measured this. In a study we did with 741 DEI officers we examined their social media–Twitter feeds–and we observed shocking levels of antisemitism coming from people with a professional obligation not to do that. It’s as if we studied doctors and found that they were smokers. It’s not something you’d expect from people in an occupation and, yet, DEI staff are active promoters of antisemitism in their social media feeds and it’s not surprising that they also facilitate it on campus.”

Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted in favor of theLaken Riley Act, which passed with bipartisan support. This legislation requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain illegal immigrants who are charged with theft or burglary following the tragic death of American college student Laken Riley at the hands of an illegal immigrant.

“Due to Joe Biden’s reckless open border policies, Laken Riley will never be able to complete her nursing degree, become a front line healthcare worker in her community, or celebrate her incredible achievements and life with her loved ones. Laken Riley’s life was robbed because Democrats refused to end the invasion of illegal immigrants via our Northern and Southern Borders. House Republicans have delivered for the American people by passing strong legislation to prevent another tragedy like what happened to Laken Riley from occurring. It’s past time Joe Biden and Democrats acted to secure our borders and put Americans’ safety and prosperity first,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Stefanik also talked about the passage of the Laken Riley Act by the House, which will prevent another tragedy like what happened to Laken Hope Riley from occurring.

Watch her full interview here.

Read highlights of her interview below:

On The Passage of the Laken Riley Act:

“Well, first of all, House Republicans stand strongly for securing our borders. And Laken Riley's death was avoidable, and it is a tragedy because of Joe Biden's dangerous open border policies. And what's a disgrace is that you have many, many democrats who voted against this important bill. And this evening, we will have an empty chair honoring Laken Riley in the House Republicans’ Speaker's Balcony. So, this is very important for us to continue to show leadership where Joe Biden has failed. And this border is a catastrophe of Joe Biden's doing and it's leading to the loss of innocent lives. So my heart goes out to Laken’s parents, we grieve for them. And we're going to continue to stand strongly for our legislation, Secure the Border Act, which would have avoided this unnecessary loss of life.”

On Joe Biden’s Failed Far Left Open Border Policies:

“Joe Biden's border crisis is a crisis that he created and the American people know that, they see it every single day. They see whether it's the skyrocketing deaths related to fentanyl, or whether it's the skyrocketing numbers of illegals that are not just pouring into our Southern Border, but across our Northern Border as well. In the past year, the Northern Border in my district, the Swanton Sector, we've had over a 500% increase in illegals crossing. This is a humanitarian crisis, a national security crisis, and an economic crisis. And when Joe Biden attempts tonight to shirk blame, and to try to put this on Congress, remember, it was Congress, it was House Republicans that passed the Secure the Border Act, and it was Joe Biden who failed to support that act. And Joe Biden himself who signed executive actions that opened this border wide open, so he may attempt to, but the American people are smart. And the White House's messaging is offensive to the American people, because the American people are smart, and they're gonna hold Joe Biden accountable for this catastrophe.”

On the Political Weaponization of the Justice System:

“Well, I have demanded that Tish James be disbarred. She is unfit for the Office of Attorney General. She is not abided by the requirements of any attorney in New York State, let alone the Attorney General. This has been a witch hunt against President Trump. She ran on illegally weaponizing her office against Joe Biden's top political opponent, but it's important, you pointed out Sandra, yes, they were booing, but you know what they were also saying they were cheering ‘Trump Trump Trump’. Because we understand that under President Trump we had safer streets, we didn't have the illegal immigration crisis and the border crisis that Democrats' policies, whether they're Tish James or Joe Biden, have created. So, Tish James again, she has illegally weaponized her office to go after Joe Biden's top political opponent. And it's not a coincidence that it's as Joe Biden's numbers are plummeting so low with the lowest approval rating in modern history for an incumbent president. So FDNY supports President Trump, New Yorkers support President Trump, and I'm proud to be the first member of Congress to endorse President Trump's reelection. He is going to defeat Joe Biden this November to save this country.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Advocates for 2A Rights at Weaponization Hearing
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– In case you missed it, today, the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government held a hearing on government entities weaponizing financial systems against the American people.

Congresswoman Stefanik discussed theProtecting Privacy in Purchases Act, which she introduced with Congressman Richard Hudson (R-NC), and Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY), that would ban the use of a Merchant Category Code to track sales at gun stores.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Mr. Knight, thank you for your testimony today. In 2022, gun ban activists, Amalgamated Bank, and Far Left politicians pushed for the creation of an unconstitutional Merchant Category Code to be assigned to firearms’ retailers to identify ‘suspect purchases’ and report purchasing patterns to law enforcement: a clear, unconstitutional infringement on Second Amendment Rights and a clear backdoor to a gun registry. In fact, failed New York Attorney General Tish James specifically mentioned the importance of “labeling gun and ammunition sales” as a way to indicate an imminent crime. Since then, some states have banned the code while states like California have mandated it to surveil Americans’ purchases. This is why I introduced the Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act with Congressmen Barr and Hudson to put a stop to this code and protect law abiding Americans from this infringing, unconstitutional overreach. Can you explain how does this code threaten Americans’ privacy and constitutional rights?”

Mr. Brian Knight, Senior Research Fellow and Director of Innovation and Governance, Mercatus Center at George Mason University:“Thank you very much. This code, and if we were going to do similar codes for other sensitive issues, risks creating a raft of false positives where individuals who are potentially engaging in Second Amendment activity because it’s important to know that the MCC doesn’t tell you what people buy, it just tells you where they buy it, right, will be reported to the government as potentially suspicious for no real basis or at least not a basis that is likely to be reasonable. And that’s going to create a database that is available that could be searched later. One of the dangerous things about this financial database is that these financial records, they’re retrospective and even perhaps, you know, just as bad is that there’s precious little reason to believe it would be effective at its stated goal for a host of reasons I can get into if you want.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Yes, please expand.”

Mr. Knight:“The problem here is that you won’t know what someone buys. You’re expecting banks to correctly identify what is really a hallmark of violence. You’re expecting them to report it promptly. You’re expecting law enforcement to then act on it promptly and effectively, and so I’d like to point to guns down America has a report that advocates the MCC, but if you look at the examples they point to as possible examples where this could have helped, it’s hard to believe they would, either because there’s such a short time frame–12 days. There's a reason to believe, I don’t see why we believe that you know 12 days would be enough time for law enforcement to act on it because we don’t know how fast it takes the government to use any SARs, or there’s actually, it’s hard to actually differentiate suspicious activity from legitimate activity, rather they look at cases and then work backwards, so we don’t know what the denominator is. We don’t know how many false positives there will be. Also, in the recent report when we look at the key bank methodology, it’s very, very broad. It’s very over inclusive, and its thresholds are such that it’s far more than you need to spend to commit a horrible act of violence but less than you’d spend to get a good hunting rifle and scope. And so how confident should we be that we’re going to actually get more signal than noise? I don’t believe we should be given how little we know about how SARs are treated as is, I think we should be deeply skeptical.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Do you believe this is a back door to a gun registry?”

Mr. Knight:“I believe some of its supporters view it as a back door to discourage firearms purchases.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Well, in my district in Upstate New York and Americans across this country are proud to stand up for our constitutional rights and understand this is an infringement on our constitutional rights. Why is my bill so important?”

Watch her full remarks here.

“The American people have spoken. They made clear what we have known for months: President Donald J. Trump is our Republican nominee and will be 47th President of the United States. His America first agenda secured our borders, made America energy independent, and always puts the needs of the American people first.

That is not the State of the Union we will hear from Joe Biden this week, because the American people deeply understand that under Joe Biden's failed presidency, the State of the Union is in crisis. And this is a crisis of Joe Biden's making. As Ronald Reagan famously asked us, “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?”. The answer for hardworking Americans across the country is a resounding ‘no’. Whether it's the catastrophic border crisis ravaging our nation and leading to tragic loss of life of American citizens, the painful Bidenflation causing middle class families to struggle to make ends meet, or our most precious ally Israel facing the bloodiest day since the Holocaust as Joe Biden projects weakness around the globe. Joe Biden has failed America and the American people.

And at what will be his final State of the Union, Joe Biden and the White House will desperately try to pass the buck, blame Congress, and shirk responsibility in a desperate attempt to reset his abysmal presidency. But it won't work, because the American people are smart. There is no reset button for Joe Biden. Even the Democrats’ loyal stenographers in the mainstream media have been forced to acknowledge that Joe Biden is a deteriorating president with a failed record and polling in freefall.

Each of our House Republican members will host a guest that highlights Joe Biden's State of the Union in crisis whether its border patrol officers, like my guest from the North Country Brandon Budlong, or families who have lost loved ones due to Joe Biden's dangerous open border policies.”

Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement after Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Chairman Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) issued a subpoena for former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to appear before the committee for a deposition on May 24, 2024.

“Promises made. Promises kept. The day of reckoning has finally arrived for disgraced Former Governor Andrew Cuomo as he must answer for his disastrous and criminal COVID policies and cover-up. His corruption needlessly cost the lives of over 15,000 vulnerable New York seniors in nursing homes across the state. House Republicans will continue to fight on behalf of grieving families to deliver much-needed and overdue accountability. Cuomo must comply with the subpoena or prepare to face further legal consequences for his criminal cover-up,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

From theSelect Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic:

Today, Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Chairman Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) announced a subpoena to compel former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to appear for a deposition on May 24, 2024.

On March 25, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued a mandate that forced New York nursing homes and long-term care facilities to admit or re-admit potentially contagious and untested COVID-19 patients. This order recklessly exposed New York’s most vulnerable population to COVID-19 with deadly consequences. During the Cuomo Administration, it was reported that more than 15,000 individuals died in New York nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Evidence also suggests that former Governor Cuomo engaged in a coverup to hide the true New York nursing home mortality rate from the public and shift political blame away from his administration.

The Select Subcommittee has worked in good faith to schedule a voluntary transcribed interview with former Governor Cuomo to discuss his COVID-19 nursing home policies. Former Governor Cuomo has repeatedly and unjustifiably delayed the Select Subcommittee’s investigation by not responding to requests for weeks, ignoring Select Subcommittee staff’s attempts to negotiate interview dates and times, and providing unreasonable availability—nine months after the interview was originally requested. Today’s subpoena has sadly become necessary to uncover the truth about New York’s pandemic-era nursing home policies and deliver the answers Americans demand, and New Yorkers especially deserve.

“Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented nursing home policies that had deadly consequences for New York’s most vulnerable population. Not only did the former Governor put the elderly in harm’s way, but he also attempted to cover-up his failures by hiding the true nursing home death rate. It appears that politics, not medicine, was responsible for these decisions, and that while Mr. Cuomo is adept at seeking legal advice, he is not necessarily adept at seeking medical advice. Former Governor Cuomo owes answers to the 15,000 families who lost loved ones in New York nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. His testimony is crucial to uncover the circumstances that led to his misguided policies and for ensuring that fatal mistakes never happen again. It is well past time for Cuomo to stop dodging accountability to Congress and start answering honestly to the American people,” said Chairman Wenstrup.

Each year, members of Congress bring a guest to Washington D.C. to attend the annual report to Congress known as the State of the Union. The Constitution requires the president to update the Congress on the state of the nation yearly. Early presidents accomplished the task by sending a letter to members of Congress, but the tradition grew to a speech in the chamber of the House of Representatives at the invitation of its speaker.

The guests of the elected officials typically highlight a national or district issue. This year, Stefanik is highlighting the issue of border security.

Stefanik’s district covers large portions of the border with New York's northern neighbor, Canada.

In a statement, the North Country representative touted her vote to pass the Secure Our Border Act and to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Budlong called the invitation an “honor,” and said Stefanik is a “fierce advocate” for border patrol agents and constituents like himself.

Title: Stefanik Announces State of the Union Guest
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. - Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced today that her guest for the 2024 State of the Union address will be Border Patrol Agent and President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2724 Brandon Budlong of Theresa, New York.

“I am honored to announce that Border Patrol Agent Brandon Budlong from Theresa will be my honored guest for this year’s State of the Union address in our nation’s Capitol,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“During Border Patrol Agent Budlong’s sixteen-year tenure, he has witnessed the devastating impact of Joe Biden’s irresponsible border policies. Every day, illegal immigrants are smuggled into our country and many lose their lives trying to brave the Northern Border’s harsh weather elements. Biden’s radical policies have incentivized an unprecedented amount of illegal crossings into the Swanton and Buffalo sectors putting tens of thousands of lives, including that of our Border Patrol Agents, at risk.

“I voted to pass the Secure the Border Act, the strongest border bill in our nation’s history, to put an end to Biden’s border crisis and voted to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for refusing to enforce our country’s immigration laws. House Republicans have delivered for the American people while Joe Biden and America Last Democrats continue to push American priorities aside. America deserves better than Joe Biden.”

“I am honored to be Congresswoman Elise Stefanik's State of the Union guest. Congresswoman Stefanik is a fierce advocate for my members on the National Border Patrol Council Local 2724 and her constituents in NY-21, continuously bringing our concerns to the highest levels of government. I am grateful for her unwavering commitment to securing our border and safeguarding our country's future,”said Brandon Budlong, Border Patrol Agent and President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2724.

Border Patrol Agent Brandon Budlong has served in the United States Border Patrol for 16 years. He is also the President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2724, representing the border Patrol Agents in the Buffalo Sector of the Northern border, including Jefferson and Lewis County in NY-21.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Holds DoD Secretary Austin Accountable for Dereliction of Duty
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, the House Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s failure to notify the President, Congress, and the American people that he was out of the Chain of Command and unable to perform his duties as Secretary of Defense.

Congresswoman Stefanik demanded that Secretary Austin take full responsibility for leaving American service members, including over 2,500 10th Mountain Division troops deployed to the Middle East, vulnerable to attack and continues to push for his resignation due to this clear dereliction of duty.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik: Thank you Mr. Chairman. On the morning of January 4th, Mr. Secretary, you were in the Critical Care Unit, the Acting Secretary of Defense was vacationing in Puerto Rico, and President Biden was unaware that you were not in the Chain of Command. Now as you know I represent Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division which you know well. Thank you for your service there in the North Country. But on this same date of January 4th, do you know how many 10th Mountain Division soldiers were deployed and are still deployed today in Iraq and Syria in support of Operation Inherent Resolve?

Secretary Austin: You know I know that they are deployed. I don't know what the number is.

Congresswoman Stefanik: It’s just over 2,500. And on January 4th at approximately 4 A.M. our time, the U.S. carried out a significant strike against a senior Iranian-backed leader in Iraq. Correct?

Secretary Austin: That’s correct.

Congresswoman Stefanik: And because President Biden did not know you were outside of the Chain of Command during this U.S. strike, if Iran or its proxies in Iraq or Syria had carried out a retaliatory strike against 10th Mountain Division soldiers, the President’s Chain of Command would have and could have broken down potentially delaying Presidential orders to protect lives of American forces, constituents that I represent. Do you understand why this is unacceptable to the American people and to those military families?

Secretary Austin: Well, thanks. First of all, I would say that when we’re attacked we have a right to defend ourselves and respond immediately if it’s a local attack. If a strike is warranted, then recommendations need to be provided to the President. Those recommendations come through from me and after I’ve consulted with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and also the Combatant Commander. The Deputy Secretary would have done the same thing and she has all of the capabilities and situational awareness to do that.

Congresswoman Stefanik: Except the President wasn’t aware. The President of the United States was not aware that you were not in the Chain of Command, so God forbid there was a retaliatory strike, that would have caused potential delays and it is unacceptable. Let me ask you this: what disciplinary action would a junior servicemember face if he or she failed to properly notify their Chain of Command and failed to report for duty?

Secretary Austin: If a service member was in a hospital I think the Chain of Command would be concerned about why they were in the hospital and make sure that they are doing the right things to take care of them and their families.

Congresswoman Stefanik: But don't you think it's their responsibility to notify their commanding officer?

Secretary Austin: I think, possible, yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik: The answer is yes.

Secretary Austin: In my case, you know I would expect that my organization would do the right things to notify senior leaders if I am the patient in the hospital.

Congresswoman Stefanik: It is unacceptable and you have admitted as such that there was a breakdown in communication with the President of the United States and I highlight the exact time, 4 A.M., January 4th, when you considered 10th Mountain division soldiers and the potential for retaliatory attack, that breakdown is unacceptable. And you said something very important. You said there was never a break in command and control. But yet the President of the United States was not aware that you were outside of the Chain of Command. So is the President not a part of this command and control? Don’t you believe that the Commander in Chief and the Sec. Def, that is critical for command and control?

Secretary Austin: He is clearly at the top of the chain in terms of command and control, but what is important is that we provide him with credible options that he can pursue to address any situation and it would’ve happened in this case.

Congresswoman Stefanik: Except he was unaware, so what’s important is the President was unaware of this breakdown in command and control and you were not there in terms of who he would hear from.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Promises to Hold Colleges Accountable at E&W Roundtable on Campus Antisemitism
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik participated in an Education and the Workforce Committee roundtable about the spread of antisemitism on campuses featuring testimonies from students from universities across the country.

Student participants from Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia University, University of California, Berkeley, Rutgers University, Stanford University, Tulane University, and Cooper Union were included.

Watch her line of questioning here.

View the transcript of her line of questioning below.

Congresswoman Stefanik: “Thank you so much Chairwoman Foxx, and thank you to each of the students for bravely sharing your testimony of your experiences that you have faced on campus. The inexcusable, hateful, and vicious antisemitism that these universities have allowed to take root and it is a rot that goes deep.

One of you testified that it’s not just about university presidents being removed, but that the fact that had to be pushed on places like Harvard for over a month was inexcusable. We need to continue to make sure that there is accountability to root out this rot of antisemitism. It is clear: It’s not just Harvard, Penn, and MIT, but each of these university leaders have failed. It is atrocious to hear the experiences that each of you have faced whether it’s threats of violent act or the horrific, horrific antisemitic statements.

My question is for Mr. Kestenbaum from Harvard as well as Talia from MIT. Both of those university presidents, one in the case is former, were in that hearing that set off an earthquake and a reckoning. Can you talk to me: What the experience has been on campus after that hearing? So you have a removal of one university, and it’s gotten worse, the antisemitism, and you have a failure from the MIT board to remove the president, in Dr. Kornbluth, and it’s also gotten worse. Can you walk me through, specifically, the antisemitism task force and some of the other things you weren't able to get to in your testimony?”

Shabbos Kestenbaum, Harvard:“Absolutely, thank you for the question. And on behalf of the many Harvard students and faculty who are watching this right now, you are a hero for the Jewish community. So, really thank you, Congresswoman. The antisemitism committee is so remarkably useless that its most respected member and my Professor, Rabbi David Wolpe, resigned. It accomplished absolutely nothing that Harvard’s solution was we’re going to create a second task force. The co-chair of this task force is someone who has repeatedly and on the record stated that antisemitism at Harvard is ‘exaggerated.’ Its other co-chair resigned three days ago. I have emailed the antisemitism task force more than forty times–four, zero. I have not received a single response. When I say that Congress is our last hope it’s because Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students. All of the acts of antisemitism that I listed in my speech all happened after Claudine Gay resigned. And I would also add that Claudine Gay is still getting paid 900,000 dollars. So what does that tell you about taking responsibility and protecting Jewish students when someone who can say that the calls for genocide against Jews is context-dependent gets to keep her job?”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“And MIT, in the case of Dr. Kornbluth, the fact that she remains as President, what message has that sent to the MIT community?”

Talia Khan, MIT:“Well, immediately after that hearing, we heard from the MIT Corporation executive board members that they fully supported Dr. Kornbluth and every single thing that she said at that hearing including her failure to explicitly condemn calls for genocide on campus. And they said that they believe that she is doing an ‘excellent job’ in combating antisemitism on campus. So, immediately after that, we just get gaslighted by the MIT Corporation. And essentially, after that, they just doubled down in gaslighting us and, you know, creating this illusion that we are, you know, a small group crying wolf. And they essentially continued to tell us, ‘Oh. We’re working on things. Things are happening. We’re very concerned.’ But it's just all lip service, and they play this game where even when we tell them we got an email from a non-Jewish student who lives with a student who is a leading member of the Anti-Israel Club who has stated, very, you know, openly in his dorm, that ‘Violence against any Jew who supports Israel is acceptable’. And when we said this to Dr. Kornbluth and the rest of MIT administration, they acknowledged it. They didn’t do anything. And so, they're making up these things calling us, you know, saying that we are exaggerating or that they can’t police free speech, but this is not about free speech. And I think that’s one thing that we’ve noticed is that there are actual threats. There are people’s offices who have been attacked. People have banged on office doors, tried to unlock office doors, and that has nothing to do with free speech. That is people’s lives at risk. That is people fearing physical violence. There have been people calling for physical violence on our campus, and literally nothing has been done. And I have to walk through the halls, every Jew at MIT has to walk through the halls, seeing these people proudly walking around after they've broken rule, after rule, after rule and not been disciplined. And we've really, it’s really scary. Genuinely, we are genuinely fearful.”

Congresswoman Stefanik:“Well, thank you for that answer. And for the lawyers, for these universities have failed. If you think this is going to get brushed under the rug, the list is getting longer by the day. This Congress will not stop until we hold you accountable. That’s a promise.”

Title: Stefanik, Van Orden Introduce Military Education  Access Bill
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik cosponsored the bipartisanEnsuring Military Access of Higher Education Benefits Actwith Congressman Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) and Congressman Don Davis (D-NC) to require the Department of Education to complete a data-matching agreement with the Department of Defense which would enable automatic credit toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program for military service members.

“I am proud to introduce this legislation with Representative Van Orden to ensure America’s service members can use their military service to easily qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Streamlining the process for our brave service members who selflessly serve our nation to receive the benefits they have earned is one of the many ways we can show our appreciation to them. It is incredibly important that we honor the extraordinary commitment our service members have made to our country as well as incentivize recruitment of future troops.”

“Those who answered the call to serve have made great sacrifices for our nation,”said Congressman Derrick Van Orden.“Of the many challenges servicemembers and veterans face, worrying about how they will pay off their student loans should not be one of them.The Ensuring Military Access to Higher Education Benefits Act does right by our servicemen and servicewomen by removing the red tape to obtaining PSLF credit, ensuring they will not be riddled with student debt during and after their time of service.”

In 2021, the Department of Education announced they would automatically count military members’ service toward the PSLF program instead of requiring them to go through a lengthy and complicated certification process. However, the change was never implemented because the Department of Education and the Department of Defense failed to finalize a critical data-sharing agreement.

In the 2023 NDAA, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik supported a provision that allowed military spouses to defer their student loans when their spouse experienced a change of duty location.

Title: Stefanik Introduces Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act to Stop Unconstitutional Tracking of Gun Sales
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, alongside Congressman Richard Hudson (R-NC) and Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY), introduced theProtecting Privacy in Purchases Actto ban the use of a Merchant Category Code to track sales at gun stores.

“The tracking of gun purchases is a violation and infringement on the Constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans which is why I am proud to introduce the Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act to prohibit radical gun grabbing politicians from tracking lawful gun purchases,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I share the concern of law-abiding gun owners across our nation that have voiced their fear that such tactics will work to serve the radical Left’s anti-gun agenda. I will always stand up for our Second Amendment rights as Americans and provide a critical check to any entity attempting to encroach on our liberties.”

“Gun grabbing liberals will stop at nothing to take away our Second Amendment rights. Now, they are going to track purchases of law-abiding gun owners. This is unacceptable, dangerous, and a first step to gun confiscation. I am proud to join Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Congressman Andy Barr in introducing this legislation to protect you,”said Congressman Richard Hudson.

"The privacy of Americans' purchases, especially when it comes to firearms, is non-negotiable,"said Congressman Andy Barr."I am proud to join Conference Chair Stefanik in standing against unnecessary and discriminatory surveillance. This bill would ensure the freedom and privacy of all Americans, guaranteeing that our Second Amendment rights are respected and protected."

“The Biden administration has already proven they cannot be trusted to respect the private firearm transactions of law-abiding citizens. Without a warrant, federal agencies collected financial information on private firearm and ammunition transactions to create an illegal government watchlist of gun owners. Representative Elise Stefanik’s legislation would rein in federal overreach to use the private financial transactions of law-abiding citizens against them for political means. No American should be concerned that the federal government is employing this scheme, concocted by gun control cheerleaders, that weaponizes an individual’s finances and their free exercise of Second Amendment rights to wrongly identify them as a criminal-in-waiting. NSSF thanks Representative Stefanik for her principled leadership to stand up for Constitutionally-protected rights and against special interests and big government lawmakers whose goal it is to monitor and deny lawful transactions, by law-abiding Americans,”said Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF Senior Vice President & General Counsel for the Firearm Industry Trade Association.

“The Merchant Category Code for firearms retailers is nothing more than a scheme to surveil law-abiding gun owners, and the Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act would protect private purchasing information from abuse by third parties,”said Randy Kozuch, Executive Director of the NRA-ILA.“On behalf of the NRA's millions of freedom-loving members, we applaud Rep. Stefanik for championing this legislation to protect the right to privacy for gun owners nationwide.”

“Singling out law-abiding gun and ammunition purchasers through the invasive and arbitrary monitoring of credit card transactions would ultimately erode the right to privacy and self-defense. The USCCA applauds Reps. Stefanik, Hudson and Barr for introducing this important legislation to protect law-abiding gun owners from discriminatory practices by financial institutions, ensuring their Second Amendment rights are shielded from corporate and government overreach,”said Tim Schmidt, President and Co-Founder of the US Concealed Carry Association.

“The Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF) thanks Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus Member Rep. Elise Stefanik for introducing the Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act,”said CSF President and CEO Jeff Crane.“Sportsmen and women who lawfully purchase firearms and ammunition should not be treated any differently than someone who purchases hiking boots. This legislation will provide a common-sense solution to maintaining the privacy of sportsmen and women and protecting our hunting and recreational shooting traditions.”

In March 2023, Congresswoman Elise Stefanikannouncedthat following her advocacy, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express paused the implementation of a new Merchant Category Code created by the International Organization for Standardization following a pressure campaign from Far Left woke politicians and financial institutions that seeks to track transactions for firearms and ammunition sales.

In September 2022, Congresswoman Stefanik sent aletterquestioning themove tochange a purchasingcodethat could make it easier for authorities to track gun purchases.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins The Kimberly Guilfoyle Show To Discuss Joe Biden’s Failures, the Rise of Antisemitism, House Republicans’ Priorities, and More
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joinedThe Kimberly Guilfoyle Showto discuss Joe Biden’s failures and lack of mental acuity as President, House Republicans’ priorities in Congress, the rise of antisemitism, and much more.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights of her interview below:

On Joe Biden’s Failed, Far Left Policies:

“My reaction is it’s not just Republicans and Independents who understand that Joe Biden is an unfit President. It’s now Democrats as well. And New Yorkers, we have experienced the crises caused by single-party, Far Left, failed, Democrat rule from Joe Biden to Chuck Schumer to Kathy Hochul and to Eric Adams. The number one issue for New Yorkers, Kimberly, is the border crisis which has been caused by Joe Biden’s executive action: where we had the most secure border in modern history under President Trump, and, yet, on day one, Joe Biden signed executive actions to open the border wide open. He got rid of the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. And he allowed ‘Catch and Release’ to take place, and we’ve seen over eight million illegals, at a minimum, cross our border. And it’s not just the Southern Border, Kimberly. In my district, I represent a large swath of the New York-Canadian Border, and we’ve seen over a 250 percent increase in illegal crossings there as well. So, New York, you just played the footage, illegals are assaulting and attacking our brave law enforcement officers. And it is clear to New Yorkers that Joe Biden has failed, and he is unfit. And while Joe Biden, Kathy Hochul, and Eric Adams, and Democrats attempt to pass the buck, people are smart. They know that it’s their policies, whether it’s the ‘Sanctuary City’ policies, whether it’s the 15,000 dollars of taxpayer funds going to debit cards for illegals in New York City, this is a catastrophe. And that’s why you are seeing just a bottoming out and a continual decline in Joe Biden's approval ratings. He has the lowest approval rating of any modern day president since Jimmy Carter, and, yet, at the same time, people know what worked. President Trump had the most secure border in modern history, and that’s why President Trump is enjoying historic support even in places like New York which are traditionally blue states.”

On the Rise Of Antisemitism and Holding Colleges and Universities Accountable:

“This is a moral crisis, and it’s a crisis that people are looking for moral leadership. And we need to condemn, clearly, antisemitism, and we’re not getting that from today’s Democrat Party. And we certainly did not get that from university presidents, two of whom are now former university presidents in the case of Penn and my alma mater, Harvard. Just remember, Kimberly, I asked a very straightforward, moral question. And that question was: ‘Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment?’ And their answers shocked the world. One after the other after the other said, ‘It depends on the context.’ People know it does not depend on the context. And that's why you saw the forced firing of those two university presidents. Two down one to go, and we have so much work ahead. So after that hearing, we launched an official investigation. And already, we have had to issue subpoenas because Harvard has refused to turn over documents and respond to our congressional requests. We will use all of our responsibility as members of Congress, and it's our responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and have oversight when it comes to higher education laws. And these schools are failing to protect Jewish students. They are failing to protect members of their community who have been assaulted by pro-Hamas radicals, pro-Hamas sympathizers of terrorists. So the subpoenas were issued just last week, and we are going to make sure that we continue moving forward. There are other universities that will be called in to testify as well. And there is a lot of work we need to do legislatively, Kimberly, in addition to holding them accountable in the committee hearing room. We need to look at the U.S. taxpayer funds that go to these institutions that are propping them up. We need to address the foreign funding piece where you have anti-Israel, foreign dollars flowing in with conditions on the type of curricula and the professors which are part of this pro-Hamas, anti-Israel, antisemitic movement that we're seeing on these college campuses. So again, this was a moral question. Those university presidents failed, and I will continue to stand up and be a leader to specifically condemn antisemitism.”

On Republicans Keeping Control Of The House and Supporting President Trump:

“You know, we feel very strongly that we're in a strong position not only to keep the House but to gain seats, win the Senate, and elect President Trump. And I will tell you, having been one of the Republicans on the ballot in both 2016 and 2020, despite what the chattering class and the media says, President Trump has long coattails, and we are stronger as a unified party. And he turns out votes more effectively than any other candidate on the ballot when it comes to Republican candidates. So I'm very optimistic that we are going to pick up seats, and we have to. We need to make sure that we flip the Senate from Democrat to Republican and elect President Trump. Because we've seen, as House Republicans, we've passed good, strong legislation, whether it's the Secure the Border Act, whether it's energy independence, whether it's the Parents’ Bill of Rights. And this legislation just dies because Chuck Schumer doesn't bring it up, and Democrats refuse to bring up these America First policy items that we have delivered. So I feel very optimistic. But we are going to work very hard every day, Kimberly, and we can't take it for granted. And that's why I'm tireless. I'm proud to be a top surrogate for President Trump. And I'm proud to be one of the leaders in the country standing up and communicating our record of results as House Republicans, how Democrats have failed, and how we will be effective and make America great again with President Trump at the top of the ticket.”

On Holding the Biden Crime Family Accountable:

“Well, first of all, we need to continue to uncover the absolute, I think this is the most scandalous corruption crisis in our nation's history. And those are the hearings and the depositions related to the Biden Crime Family with the impeachment inquiry. We continue to see bombshell reports of Biden family members, whether it's Joe Biden's brother, James Biden, or his son Hunter Biden relying on Joe Biden's name and influence peddling using Joe Biden to fill their family's coffers with hundreds of thousands of dollars from adversaries, whether it's Communist China, or whether it's other adversaries around the world. And some of that money, Kimberly, hundreds of thousands of dollars of that money went directly into the bank accounts of Joe and Jill Biden. Again, this is the most scandalous corruption scandal in our lifetime.”

On House Republicans’ Priorities:

“Well, you see the double standard in how the mainstream media act like sycophants and loyal stenographers for Joe Biden. And, you know, we see them continue to try to brush these scandals under the rug. The other piece here, Kimberly, is we're going to continue fighting and standing up for legislation that we've passed on border security. You're seeing Joe Biden desperately trying to convince the American people that the border crisis is not his fault. It's offensive that he's saying that. The American people are smart. They know that we had a very secure border under President Trump and that it was Joe Biden's executive actions that have led to this wide open border. House Republicans passed our Secure the Border Act. We have legislatively passed so many key, conservative bills, again, that Chuck Schumer has failed to take up. Another priority for House Republicans is support for Israel. We have seen our most precious ally under attack. And Israel faced the bloodiest day since the Holocaust for the Jewish people after the October 7th vicious, barbaric atrocities committed by Hamas, backed by Iran. And for the first time, Kimberly, this White House, Joe Biden issued a veto threat for the actual number that he requested for Israel aid that we were proud to put on the House Floor. The Democrat White House under the leadership of Joe Biden, threatened to veto that. So we're going to continue to work tirelessly as House Republicans to support our strong ally Israel, and to focus on the border, and also make sure that we have conservative policy wins when it comes to appropriations. And we will continue to block Joe Biden's socialist policies that are destroying America.”

On Democrats’ Unraveling Democracy:

“This is really unraveling our Democracy. We see that the Left is attacking who we are as a Constitutional Republic. They are trying to literally remove President Trump from the ballot. We see that in multiple states, and these are radical Leftists who know that they are struggling. They will struggle to win at the ballot box with Joe Biden whose poll numbers continue to plummet. But take my home state of New York as well, we are seeing a mass exodus of businesses on top of the already mass exodus because of the horrific economic policies and the crime crisis because we see a New York Attorney General, Tish James, who ran on going after President Trump, she should be disbarred. There was no victim. There was no crime committed, and people see through this for what it is that it was a witch hunt on top of other witch hunts. This has been a continual story among Democrats going back to 2016, Kimberly, and the unprecedented attempt whether it was the perpetration of the Russia hoax, whether it was sham impeachment one or two. But I've called for Tish James to be disbarred. She does not meet the standards of judicial ethics. And you have higher standards when you were Attorney General of New York State. I've also challenged the judicial ethics of multiple judges who are, again, colluding with Democrats with the Radical Left to go after President Trump, really to do Joe Biden's bidding. And what I think is most powerful, Kimberly, is President Trump when he speaks to the American people, the Department of Justice is weaponized after him. But that means they can go after everyone, and they have gone after Catholics, Conservatives, even parents at school board meetings. So this is really a shredding of our Democracy that we're seeing in today’s Far Left, Democrat Party.”

On Joe Biden’s Lack of Mental Acuity:

"My opinion is this White House and the Biden campaign are so desperate. They are just trying to get through every single day. They are trying to get him through press conferences, and it has been an abysmal failure. You saw, Kimberly and the American people saw just two weeks ago when he did that press conference after the damning Special Counsel Report, that not only said that he illegally kept classified information but that they weren't going to prosecute him and have selective prosecution because of his lack of mental acuity. And it goes back to the poll you showed: 70 percent of New Yorkers and certainly the majority of Americans, the large majority, believe that Joe Biden is unfit for office. They can't get Joe Biden through the day, but I do think they are desperately trying to just prop him up. And that's why you're seeing this law fair to try to remove President Trump from the ballot. Let's show that in stark contrast to President Trump. I mean, I see him on the campaign trail as I'm a surrogate for him. He is all over the country, and yet, the Left is forcing him to be in these courtrooms. He is doing that. He's going to Iowa, to South Carolina, to New Hampshire. He had a sweep of the early primary states. He is going on offense, speaking to the American people. And that's why he's going to win this November. But I don't think Democrats, you know, we'll see how it plays out. I still think Joe Biden, they're going to try to limp over the finish line, but they're going to lose because he is unfit to serve as President of the United States.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on E&W Serving Harvard a Subpoena
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement following Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virgina Foxx’sannouncementthat the committee served subpoenas to Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny Pritzker, Interim President Dr. Alan Garber, and Harvard Management Company’s Chief Executive Officer N.P. Narvekar for failing to produce priority documents related to the Committee’s antisemitism investigation.

“Today’s historic subpoena of Harvard University was caused by the intransigent and failed leadership of Penny Pritzker and the Harvard Corporation. After refusing to take swift action in response to former President Claudine Gay’s morally bankrupt testimony, Harvard’s leadership has failed to address the antisemitic hate that has infected its campus.

The House Education and the Workforce Committee will not stand idly by and this subpoena is a critical next step to holding Harvard accountable and ultimately ensuring Harvard is safe for Jewish students and faculty. I applaud Chairwoman Foxx for holding these failed institutions accountable.”

Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. - Today, the bipartisanForeign Adversary Communications Transparency (FACT) Actreceived a legislative hearing in the House Energy and Commerce’s Communications and Technology Subcommittee. This legislation, introduced by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI), would counter the influence of China and other foreign adversaries on the United States’ telecommunications infrastructure.

“Allowing companies owned by Communist China and other foreign adversaries access to our critical infrastructure leaves our country vulnerable to attack,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop Communist China and other foreign adversaries’ subversion of our sovereignty and the FACT Act does that by bringing transparency to the influence that ouradversarieshave over our critical infrastructure.”

Specifically, theForeign Adversary Communications Transparency (FACT) Actwould provide critical telecommunications transparency by requiring the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish a list of companies who hold FCC authorizations, licenses, or other grants of authority any ownership by foreign adversarial governments, including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba.

This legislation would add Chinese drone company Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Covered List, meaning that DJI technologies would be prohibited from operating on U.S. communications infrastructure.

“The advancement of my legislation the Countering CCP Drones Act is critical for American national security. Communist Chinese drones present a serious national security risk to our country and it is time for Congress to act. Communist Chinese companies that engage in espionage activities and collect sensitive data from American citizens and entities should not be allowed to operate in the United States and this legislation is the first step to prohibiting Chinese drone companies from freely operating on America’s communications infrastructure,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Title: Stefanik Votes to Pass Resolution Condemning Sexual Violence by Hamas
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted for House passage of a bipartisan resolution condemning the rape and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists against Israeli women.

“I stand with my colleagues to strongly condemn Hamas’s horrific use of rape and sexual violence against Israeli women and young girls. These barbaric atrocities must be universally and completely condemned, however organizations like UN Women that are supposed to protect women worldwide have abhorrently turned their backs on Israeli women. It is critical that the U.S. show Israeli women that we stand with them. I strongly support this resolution to condemn Hamas’s use of sexual violence and to demand that every international organization and foreign government do the same.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Discusses The Impeachment of DHS Secretary Mayorkas, Special Counsel Hur’s Report, and Ending Joe Biden’s War on American Energy
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her House Republican colleagues to discuss Special Counsel Robert Hur’s bombshell report that highlighted the fundamentally un-American two-tiered justice system that exists in Joe Biden’s America, last night's vote to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and how House Republicans are fighting to end Joe Biden’s war on American energy.

Watch her full remarks here.

Find her full remarks below.

“Good morning. First, House Republicans are so excited to welcome back our Majority Leader, the legend from Louisiana, Steve Scalise. Welcome back, Steve. We’re so excited to have you back.

Before we talk about the week ahead, I want to touch on the bombshell report last week from the Special Counsel confirming that President Biden retained and mishandled classified documents for years in unsecure location. Special Counsel Hur’s decision to not prosecute Biden because of his deteriorating mental state further demonstrates the unAmerican, two-tiered justice system that exists in Joe Biden’s America. There cannot be one set of rules if your last name is Biden and another set of rules for the rest of America. And the American people know that if someone is mentally unfit to stand trial they are unfit to serve as Commander in Chief.

Turning to our agenda of this week, House Republicans will continue to deliver on our promises.

Yesterday, after a year long investigation led by the House Homeland Security Committee under the leadership of Chairman Mark Green, we executed our constitutional duty impeaching Secretary Mayorkas for violating his oath to support and defend the Constitution, subvert the rule of law, and breach the American public’s trust. Impeachment is just one step. The Senate must pass House Republicans’ Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill in history, to stop the invasion at our borders which we are seeing under Joe Biden’s policies.

This week, House Republicans will also bring the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act to the House Floor, stopping Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashing domestic energy production.”

“House Republicans delivered accountability for the American people today when we impeached Alejandro Mayorkas for his willful and systematic refusal to comply with federal immigration laws and his breach of public trust. His impeachment should send a clear message to the Biden Administration: it’s time to do your constitutional duty and secure our nation’s borders,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Under Mayorkas’s failed leadership, every state is a border state due to Joe Biden and Mayorkas' incompetence and failed policies.”

Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the below statement followingreportsthat a subterranean data center belonging to Hamas had been discovered under the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's (UNRWA) headquarters in the Gaza Strip.

"Joe Biden chose to reverse President Trump’s decision to cut off U.S. taxpayer dollars to UNRWA and we are once again seeing the devastating consequences of this horrific decision. Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists built an entire underground command center directly below UNRWA’s headquarters in Gaza. There is no way that UNRWA did not know about these Hamas tunnels, and they must be held accountable for their role in aiding Hamas in carrying out the barbaric October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. The Biden Administration must permanently cut off all U.S. funding to UNRWA, revoke UNRWA’s tax exempt status, and immediately conduct rigorous oversight of all U.S. money being sent to the UN."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins CNN's The Source with Kaitlan Collins To Discuss the Far Left's Weaponization of the Judicial System In Their Witch Hunt Against President Trump
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined CNN’sThe Sourcewith Kaitlan Collinsto discuss attempts from Far Left Democrats to illegally remove President Donald Trump from the ballot, the two-tiered system of justice, Joe Biden’s plummeting in the poll numbers, and more.

Watch her full interview here.

Find her full remarks below.

On the Far Left’s Political Witch Hunt Against President Donald Trump:

“Well, it shows that the Left and the Democrat Party and Joe Biden’s campaign, they know they're going to lose at the ballot box which is why you’re seeing lawfare. You’re seeing witch hunt after witch hunt, court case after court case, going after Joe Biden’s top political opponent which is Donald Trump. And today was a very bad day for Joe Biden. It was a very bad day in court for the Left. It was a very bad day for the Colorado bogus court case. It was a very good day for President Trump, and it was a good day for the Constitution and the American people. The American people are going to make this decision in November not radical bureaucrats from the state of Colorado, not radical judges, or Far Left prosecutors.”

On President Donald Trump Dominating in the Polls:

“This is a witch hunt against President Trump, and it is not a coincidence that it is while President Trump is skyrocketing in the polls. Meanwhile, we saw a disastrous day for Joe Biden. Joe Biden started this week plummeting in the polls, the weakest polling for a modern day President, an incumbent president, and yet you saw a feeble, mental acuity lacking in the President of the United States just today. So this is a horrible day. It's a disastrous day for Joe Biden. It's a winning day for Donald Trump, and the Supreme Court case is likely to have multiple liberal justices that side with the conservative justices in this case siding for the Constitution.”

On the Supreme Court Ruling in Favor of President Donald Trump:

“Absolutely. And you heard questions whether it was from Justice Elena Kagan, you heard multiple questions from the liberal justices who are likely, I believe, this could be a nine-zero, an eight-one or a seven-two case.”

On President Donald Trump’s Right to Presidential Immunity:

“Well, certainly, I will have something to say when the court makes that decision. But I already have put out a public statement. Of course, the President has presidential immunity. You can't handcuff a sitting President of the United States for future presidents to go after them. It would not allow them to do their job in their official capacity. So that was a wrongheaded decision. I expect the Supreme Court will overturn that as well.”

On the Department of Justice’s Selective Prosecution:

“Well, that's what the Trump campaign put out. They said this is a very slippery slope because it means that if you're of an opposing party that you could go after your predecessor based upon policy disagreements or official acts. So that's why this is so egregious. And the reality is, Kaitlan, the issues that the American people are concerned about. They're concerned about the border. They're concerned about the inflation crisis. They're concerned about the lack of leadership from the sitting President of the United States, Joe Biden. That's why they're going to make the decision to vote for President Trump at the polls, and that's why you're seeing, despite lawsuit after lawsuit, President Trump's numbers continue to go up because this is not a fair justice system right now. You see the justice system being weaponized against Joe Biden's top political opponent, and that's Donald Trump.”

On the Department of Justice’s Scathing Special Counsel Report:

“Well, first of all, if you look at what the Special Counsel said: it was a willful, willfully not abiding by rules when it comes to classified information, willfully breaking the law. And the only reason they're not pursuing prosecution is because of the lack of mental acuity of the President of the United States, and this disastrous press conference."

...

"It’s specifically because of the mental acuity that was pointed out in the document. That's why you saw a panicked White House forced out a doddering unfit President of the United States for a disastrous press conference to try to clean it up. And it only did more damage. The reality, Kaitlan, is Donald Trump is going to win this November, and Democrats are spiraling out of control because they see that Joe Biden continues to plummet. His polls are gonna go down much further tomorrow based upon that horrific press conference today, and it's selective prosecution, the fact that it's not even a slap on the wrist when the prosecutor himself especially."

On Joe Biden’s Lack of Declassification Authorities:

“Because it's a witch hunt. This is at the behest of Joe Biden. No no no. First of all, there's a difference here. President Trump has been, according to the Presidential Records Act, he has declassification authorities. Joe Biden did not have that when he was Vice President of the United States. Joe Biden also had classified documents when he was a sitting senator, that is not covered by the Presidential Records Act.”

On Joe Biden Being Mentally Unfit & DOJ Refusing to Prosecute:

“This was a raid on Mar-A-Lago, Kaitlan, versus working with Joe Biden and saying he willfully broke the law but refusing to prosecute. It is selective prosecution. Joe Biden's DOJ ordered by Merrick Garland not to prosecute against Joe Biden even though it specifically found that he willfully broke the law. And on top of that. The reason why they're not prosecuting is because they say he's mentally unfit to put in front to pursue that. That is unheard of and it is selective prosecution and it's why people inherently know across this country, if your last name happens to be Biden or Clinton, you get to live by a different set of rules than everyday average Americans.”

On Hunter Biden’s Sweetheart Plea Deal:

“Hunter Biden got a sweetheart deal. Let's talk about that. Let’s talk more about the corruption of the Biden family.”

On Defending President Donald Trump & Serving As Top Surrogate:

“I’m proud to be one of the top surrogates for President Trump. I voted for President Trump in 2016. I was proud to work with him. I’ve worked with him on his impeachment defense team when the first witch hunt started against him perpetrated by the Democrats and Adam Schiff and I am proud to be a top surrogate. I would be proud to serve in a future Trump Administration, but we have a lot to do.”

On Joe Biden’s Refusal to Secure The Border:

“I have a lot of responsibility as the House Republican Conference Chair and most importantly as the Representative for New York’s 21st Congressional District giving them a seat at the highest level and we’re focused on the issues that matter to the American people: the border crisis which is raging across our country. House Republicans passed a border security bill. Joe Biden has failed. In fact, he has caused this border crisis."

...

"We passed a border bill and you and I both know how difficult it has been historically for a border bill to come together but we got it done. House Republicans passed a border bill that Joe Biden opposed, Kaitlan.The Biden border crisis is because of Joe Biden’s executive action. H.R. 2 passed, and Joe Biden opposed that. The reason why he opposed it is because he wants a wide open border which is what his Executive Action caused.”

…

“He has the executive authority to do so. No, I'm not. I'm not allowing you to just say something that’s just factually not true. He has the executive authority right now to end catch and release. He has the executive authority right now to close the border.”

On Attempts by Radical Leftists To Hijack American Elections:

“I stood up for the Constitution. I would not have done what Mike Pence did. I don't think that was the right approach. I specifically stand by what I said on the House floor, and I stand by my statement which was there was unconstitutional overreach. There was unconstitutional overreach in states like Pennsylvania. And I think it's very important that we continue to stand up for the Constitution and have legal and secure elections which we did not have in 2020. And tens of millions of Americans agree with me, Kaitlan.”

On Ensuring A Constitutional Election:

“Listen, we need to make sure the election is Constitutionally legal. We're talking about Democrats. It was not Kaitlan. It was unconstitutional when they were circumventing state legislatures unilaterally changing election law. I stand by my statement on the House floor. And again, tens of millions of Americans agree with that statement and have questions about the validity, and legality, and constitutionality. Because the American people have rightful questions on the constitutionality. And let me say this for you: when it comes to this election, we're seeing the Democrats trying to remove President Trump from the ballot. That is not Constitutional. That is not a legal and safe, secure election. That's literally what's being discussed at the Supreme Court today because radical leftists can't stand the fact that Donald Trump continues to skyrocket in the polls and Joe Biden continues to plummet. And if you get outside of CNN and talk to hardworking American people, like in my district, like across this country, they want to see new leadership in President Trump and that’s why he’s going to win.”

On Condemning Joe Biden’s Refusal to Stand with Israel:

“I've given those family members of hostages in Israel, we've hosted them among House Republicans, and we continue to stand up to make sure Israel has the right to defend itself. And Kaitlan, you should be condemning the fact that the President of the United States called into question Israel at his press conference today. Meanwhile, he misunderstood and confused the President of Egypt with the President of Mexico. But I will continue to stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and yet you have a President of the United States who issued a veto threat. I stand by my statement there."

On the Two-Tiered System of Justice:

“And what people are seeing is an unequal Department of Justice where on one hand you have BLM violent rioters who are not being prosecuted by the DOJ, and you have nonviolent individuals who were in the Capitol on January 6 but did not commit violent acts, who are being prosecuted by the DOJ, being held. That is inherently unAmerican.”

…

“CNN continues to struggle because you've continued to fail to understand the American people's frustration with this two-tiered set of justice in this country.”

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Congressman Jim Banks (R-IN) calling on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to launch an investigation into the International Crisis Group for potentially violating theForeign Agents Registration Act (FARA)followingreportsthe organization has engaged in a longstanding secret relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

“The DOJ must immediately open an investigation into the International Crisis Group for failing to register their formal agreement with Iran, a clear violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We must investigate the depths of Crisis Group’s employees' involvement in advocating on behalf of the Iranian regime while simultaneously trying to influence Biden Administration officials,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“Joe Biden’s disgraced former Iran envoy ran a foreign think tank that had entered into an undisclosed formal agreement with an Iranian government organization which denies the Holocaust. Members of this same foreign think tank were pledging allegiance to Iran while advising Democratic administrations on Iran policy. It’s unbelievable. The Justice Department must hold the International Crisis Group accountable for failing to register as a foreign agent, and Congress should continue to investigate Iran’s infiltration of the Biden administration and its malign influence on White House policy,”said Congressman Jim Banks.

Title: House Republican Leadership Statement on Special Counsel Report
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -House Republican Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, and Majority Whip Emmer today released the following statement regarding the Special Counsel report:

The Special Counsel’s finding that President Biden ‘willfully retained and disclosed classified materials’ and engaged in practices that ‘present serious risks to national security’ is deeply disturbing.

Not only does it demonstrate the President’s recklessness, but exposes a two-tiered system of justice that is indicting one President with politically motivated charges while carrying water for another amid similar allegations.

Among the most disturbing parts of this report is the Special Counsel’s justification for not recommending charges: namely that the President’s memory had such ‘significant limitations’ that he could not convince a jury that the President held a ‘mental state of willfulness’ that a serious felony requires.

Title: Stefanik Statement On The D.C. Court Of Appeals Presidential Immunity Ruling
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement:

"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling that President Donald Trump does not have immunity from prosecution sets a dangerous precedent, violates our Constitution, and threatens the very bedrock of our nation. President Trump's actions surrounding election integrity were within his official duties as the President as he was investigating legitimate Constitutional questions about the election. The precedent set today by the D.C. Circuit's decision means that future presidents who leave office will likely face politicized prosecutions by the opposing party. The President of the United States must have immunity, like Members of Congress and federal judges, which is necessary for any presidency to function properly. I fully support President Trump's efforts to appeal this unconstitutional ruling to the Supreme Court, where I expect a thoughtful decision to overturn this dangerous precedent."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: "Joe Biden's Weakness Has Emboldened Our Adversaries Abroad And Put American Lives At Risk"
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her House colleagues to discuss the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act which will provide lifesaving funding and resources to our most precious ally Israel and protect American service members who are under attack from Iranian-backed terrorists.

Stefanik also discussed the House vote to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his willful and systemic refusal to enforce our immigration laws and breach of public trust.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Good morning. This week, House Republicans continue to lead on key issues facing Americans at home and threats facing our troops and allies abroad.

Unlike Joe Biden, House Republicans stand with Israel, and we will vote on the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act: a standalone 17.6 billion-dollar package which will provide lifesaving funding and resources to stand with Israel and protect American soldiers who have been under attack from Iranian-backed proxies. Under Joe Biden, over one hundred and fifty attacks have been carried out against American soldiers by Iranian terrorists and their supporters. Joe Biden's weakness has emboldened our adversaries abroad and put American lives at risk. Providing funding for our troops and ensuring Israel has the resources to defend itself from the onslaught of unprovoked terrorist backed attacks is not political or partisan. It is a moral imperative.

Here at home, Joe Biden’s weakness and open border policies have left our borders wide open. Millions of illegal immigrants have invaded our country due to Joe Biden's open border, executive actions. And while Joe Biden and Extreme Democrats push non-starter legislation that will only worsen the crisis at our border, House Republicans have already passed H.R. 2, the strongest border package ever, and this week, we will vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his willful and systemic refusal to enforce our immigration laws and breach of public trust.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: President Donald Trump Did Not Engage In Insurrection Or Rebellion Against The United States That Is A Fact

Washington D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) to discuss their resolution affirming that President Donald Trump did not engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Stefanik highlighted how Far Left Democrat operatives are attempting to use this lie to illegally prevent President Trump from returning to the White House, shredding the Constitution in the process.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Thank you so much, Matt Gaetz.

The American People are smart. They know that the weaponized attacks of radical, Far Left prosecutors and Joe Biden’s Department of Justice against President Donald Trump are nothing more than a targeted, political witch hunt used to further their own extreme, Far Left political agenda and hijack the will of the American people come election day. As President Donald Trump continues to dominate in the polls, Extreme Democrats will stop at nothing in attempt to prevent President Donald Trump from returning to the White House, and the Democrats are shredding the Constitution in the process. Joe Biden claims that democracy is on the ballot, yet the American people know that it is Joe Biden and Democrats who are openly attacking democracy.

I am honored to stand as an original cosponsor on Congressman Gaetz’s resolution that President Donald Trump did not engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. That is a fact. Rogue, Far Left Democrat operatives are attempting to use this lie to illegally take President Trump off the ballot. This week, the Supreme Court will begin arguments in Trump v. Anderson to determine if liberal activists’ judges have the right to erase Donald Trump from the ballot, steal the election and the American people’s right to elect our leaders. For the sake of American democracy, I am proud to fight for President Trump and the tens of millions of American patriots who face political persecution.”

Title: House Republican Leadership Statement on Senate Immigration Bill
Date: 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, and Majority Whip Emmer issued the following statement regarding the Senate’s immigration bill:

“House Republicans oppose the Senate immigration bill because it fails in every policy area needed to secure our border and would actually incentivize more illegal immigration.

“Among its many flaws, the bill expands work authorizations for illegal aliens while failing to include critical asylum reforms. Even worse, its language allowing illegals to be ‘released from physical custody’ would effectively endorse the Biden ‘catch and release’ policy.

“The so-called ‘shutdown’ authority in the bill is anything but, riddled with loopholes that grant far too much discretionary authority to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas – who has proven he will exploit every measure possible, in defiance of the law, to keep the border open.

“The bill also fails to adequately stop the President’s abuse of parole authority and provides for taxpayer funds to fly and house illegal immigrants in hotels through the FEMA Shelter and Services Program.

“Because President Biden has refused to utilize his broad executive authority to end the border catastrophe that he has created, the House led nine months ago with the passage of the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2). That bill contains the necessary components to actually stem the flow of illegals and end the present crisis. The Senate must take it up immediately.

“America’s sovereignty is at stake.

“Any consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time. It is DEAD on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it.”

Title: Stefanik Statement Demanding Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin Respond to the House Armed Services Committee's Request to Testify
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement condemning Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for his dismissive response to questions on his hospitalization and demanding his immediate response to the House Armed Services Committee's request to testify regarding his clear dereliction of duty.

“Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s casual dismissal of concerns over his abandonment of duty upon returning to work was both insulting and totally unacceptable. His willful refusal to notify the President, the National Security Council, and the American people exposes not only a lack of serious judgment but a clear dereliction of duty and erosion of the American people’s trust. As our nation is embroiled in multiple conflicts overseas, thanks to Joe Biden’s weak global leadership, it has never been more imperative to have a Secretary of Defense that is transparent and trusted. The American people deserve accountability. Secretary Austin must stop stonewalling our Congressional investigation and agree to testify before the House Armed Services Committee on February 14th.”

“I am thankful for the agents and officers who arrested this dangerous criminal and kept him from causing harm to Franklin County residents. Joe Biden’s reckless open border and Kathy Hochul’s radical “Sanctuary State” policies have emboldened illegal immigrants to come to our country. Joe Biden and Far Left Albany Democrats are willingly sacrificing the safety and security of Upstate New York, the North Country, and communities nationwide by refusing to secure our border and handicapping our brave law enforcement from protecting law-abiding citizens. It is past time that Chuck Schumer passed, and Joe Biden signed into law the House Republicans’ Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill in our nation’s history to bring an immediate end to the full-fledged invasions occurring at our borders.”

Title: Stefanik, Sewell, Rubio, and Tester Introduce Legislation to Improve Maternal Healthcare for Service Members
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) joined Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jon Tester (D-MT) in introducing theImproving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Actto ensure service members and their spouses are able to receive proper and sufficient maternity services.

“I am proud to lead the Improving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Act to ensure our service members and their families have adequate, available, and local prenatal and postnatal care. Our service members and their families endure many hardships, ensuring accessible maternal healthcare should not be one of them,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“As a mom, it is despicable to readreportsof expecting mothers being turned away from hospitals on military installations due to a shortage in full-service medical staff. Service members and their families selflessly serve our nation and it is our responsibility to take care of them and their families during the most important moments of their lives.”

“Ensuring the well-being of our military families means addressing the unique challenges mothers face while they, or their spouses, serve in the military. The Improving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Act is a crucial step towards understanding and overcoming the obstacles to maternal health care within the Military Health System,”said Senator Marco Rubio.

“Our service members and their families deserve access to reliable and quality health care all the time, and that includes maternity services. To better serve our expecting service members and their spouses, we need to better understand the challenges they face while attempting to access care. I’m proud to co-lead this bill which will continue to improve maternal health care for the very families who protect our nation,”said Congresswoman Terri Sewell.

“It’s critically important that mothers who are veterans, military spouses, or currently serving this country have access to quality, affordable health care. Our bill will help make sure female service members and military spouses can access the same care as civilians through TRICARE, and ensure we live up to the promises we make to them when they sign up to serve our nation,”said Senator Jon Tester.

Currently, there are instances when military treatment facilities (MTF) do not provide prenatal or postnatal care, forcing service members and their spouses to look off base. Often when installations are in rural areas this forces service members and their spouses to have to travel long distances to receive maternal care. Additionally, the maternal health patient satisfaction of service members and their spouses has been decreasing over the last few years and is much lower than patient satisfaction of other healthcare procedures.

TheImproving Access to Maternal Health for Military and Dependent Moms Actwould require DoD to submit a report to Congress, no later than two years after enactment, that includes the following data points in relation to service members and dependents over the previous two-year period:

An analysis of the availability of maternal healthcare within the TRICARE program network;

Identification of staffing shortages in positions relating to pregnancy and childbirth, including obstetricians, midwives, labor and delivery nurses, and OBGYN;

Description of challenges faced by beneficiaries in accessing maternal healthcare within the MHS;

Analysis of timeliness of access to maternal healthcare, including wait times for appointments;

Information on how MHS tracks patient satisfaction with these services;

The number of dependents who chose to access maternal healthcare through providers outside of MTFs;

Process to establish continuity of maternal healthcare for beneficiaries who experience a PCS during a pregnancy, and identification of barriers with regards to continuity of care during PCS;

The amount of funds annually expended for the past 10 years by DoD on maternal healthcare and by beneficiaries on out-of-pocket costs associated with maternal healthcare;

Military-specific health challenges impacting pregnant beneficiaries; and

Recommendations and legislative proposals to:

Address staffing shortages;

Improve delivery and availability of maternal health services through MHS and improve patient experience; and

Improve continuity of care for covered individuals during PCS.

“Today, I proudly voted to extend President Trump’s pro-growth policies in a critical tax reform package that delivers conservative wins for working communities in Upstate New York, the North Country, and nationwide. This bipartisan legislation bolsters the financial security of working families, boosts American competitiveness, and cuts wasteful spending by eliminating COVID-era fraud-ridden programs and saving the American taxpayer billions of dollars. I applaud Chairman Jason Smith for getting this package across the finish line and delivering results for the American taxpayer.”

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the House Committee on Homeland Security’s advancement of articles of impeachment for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

“I strongly support Chairman Green and Homeland Security Committee Republicans for taking this important step to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable for willfully and systemically refusing to comply with federal immigration laws and acting in a manner subversive of the rule of law and creating the most pressing humanitarian, national security, and homeland crisis in our nation’s history,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“The catastrophic Biden border crisis, which Mayorkas is the architect of, has turned every American community into a border community and destroyed countless American families in the process, including my home state of New York where illegal encounters along the Swanton and Buffalo Sector of the Northern Border have skyrocketed. House Republicans will continue to fight to secure the border and hold Joe Biden and his Administration accountable."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Leads House Republican Roundtable On The Impact Of The Biden Border Crisis
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik lead fellow House Republicans in a roundtable dissent, which featured Sheriff Michael Chapman, Sheriff from Loudoun County, VA & Member of National Sheriff Association, Anne Basham, Founder of the Interparliamentary Taskforce on Human Trafficking & CEO of Ascend Consulting, and Brandon Judd, President of National Border Patrol Council, to highlight and discuss the impact the Biden Border Crisis is having across the country.

Watch the full roundtable here.

View highlights from the roundtable below.

On the Impact Of the Biden Border Crisis:

“Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being here today. I want to thank members of the House Republican Conference as well as our special guests who I will introduce shortly. This is part of a series of events highlighting the impact of Biden’s Border Crisis on the American people. Earlier this week, we hosted a press conference with our colleagues from the Texas Delegation who highlighted the existential and national security threat that the invasion at our Southern Border that they’re facing every single day. Before we get into this conversation, I wanted to first turn it over to our Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who has been a leader, a stalwart leader on the issue of securing the border. And then, I will be moderating this event and look forward to hearing from our guests and our other members. Speaker Mike Johnson.”

Questioning with Brandon Judd, President of National Border Patrol Council:

Stefanik:“As you know, I represent a border district but on the Northern Border. And we’ve not only seen the existential threat on the Southern Border and the invasion on the Southern Border, but the Swanton Sector which I represent on the Northern Border, we’ve seen an increase of over 500 percent in just the past year of illegals crossing the Northern Border. As President of the National Border Patrol Council, can you provide an overall, situational update on what you’re seeing on the border both on the Southern and Northern Border and how much this is a historic threat we’re facing right now?”

Judd:“Absolutely, Congresswoman, Chairwoman I apologize. I’m here as the voice of all of our Border Patrol agents. They have asked me to come here. They’ve asked me to express their concerns, and those concerns are not just about the Southwest Border. In fact, when you look at the Southwest Border and you look at the destabilization of that border, it actually has an impact across the entire United States. We don’t just patrol the Southwest Border. We patrol the Northern Border. We also patrol the Coastal Border. And we have seen a huge impact in the numbers that are crossing our borders. And what really worries me about the Northern Border and having patrolled there for eight years, three in Maine and five in Montana, what concerns me is it was widely known that if terrorists wanted to enter our country, they were going to enter our country from the Northern Border simply because of how easy it is to come into Canada. And you come into Canada, get that visitor visa, and then you work your way down to the Northern Border, and you cross into the United States from there. And so when you look at the way the cartels work, when you look at these transnational criminal organizations, they know exactly how to exploit our resources, and they do that starting on the Southwest Border. And then they work their way up to the Northern Border. And these numbers that you’re pointing out, it has a huge impact what happens on the Southwest Border because of the depletion of our resources up on the Northern Border. And when you don't have those resources, you can’t properly patrol the border. I appreciate Speaker Johnson pointing out that it’s 85 percent. It’s actually at least 85 percent. That number goes up depending upon the ebbs and flows of any given month, but it’s at least 85 percent. And then on top of that, you have to add on what ICE is also releasing, so when we transfer custody from the Border Patrol to ICE, they also release a percentage of those individuals. And again, looking at the impact that it has on the Northern Border, that is an area that the cartels are currently exploiting. We have no idea what the gotaways are up on the Northern Border. House Whip Emmer talking about the gotaways. We just have no idea because we don't have the resources to properly understand what's going on there simply because this Administration has destabilized our Southwest Border.”

On House Republicans’ Commitment To Secure The Border:

“For the American people that are watching today, there is a reason that the border crisis is the number one issue, and it is because it has been a catastrophe of Joe Biden’s making. You heard from members all across this country who talked about how every state is a border state, whether it’s New York, Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, we heard from Texas, West Virginia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, every state is facing this border crisis. It's a humanitarian crisis, a national security crisis with hundreds on the terrorist watch list. It is an economic crisis, a sovereignty crisis, and a constitutional crisis. House Republicans will continue to lead on securing the border and returning to the most secure border policies that we've ever seen under President Trump. We passed the Secure the Border Act. We know we need to return to the 'Remain in Mexico’ policy. We must end ‘Catch and Release’. We have to support our Border Patrol officers and our local law enforcement across this country, and we have to continue building the wall. We passed our secure the border bill. We will continue to stand to make sure that we're protecting this great nation. And we will hold Secretary Mayorkas and most importantly, President Joe Biden accountable. And the American people are going to hold them accountable as well. Thank you very much to our guests who are here today. Thank you, Anne, on behalf of so many victims of human trafficking that are facing this humanitarian scourge. Thank you, Brandon Judd, for your advocacy on behalf of your colleagues in the Border Patrol. I represent Border Patrol agents in my district who we work with every day. So as you talked about the challenges they're facing because of the surge on both the Southern and Northern Border, we hear that every single day from my constituents. And thank you, Sheriff, on behalf of all the incredible law enforcement officers including the 15 County Sheriffs in my district who work so hard every day. We're so grateful for your leadership. Thank you very much.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: In Joe Biden’s America, Illegal Immigrants Come First, And American Families Come Last
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her House colleagues to discuss the Biden border crisis which has created the most pressing humanitarian, national security, and homeland crisis in our nation’s history.

Chairwoman Stefanik started off the press conference with a moment of silence to honor the three U.S. service members that bore the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country in an Iranian-backed terrorist attack against U.S. forces in the Middle East.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Good morning. I want to begin by taking a moment of silence to honor the three U.S. service members that bore the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country.

We know that American troops are at risk around the world because of Joe Biden’s weak global leadership that foreign adversaries like Iran fear no reprisal for taking American lives.

Also, at home, border security is the most fundamental responsibility of a nation, and House Republicans are serving as the last line of defense to secure our border. As we speak, House Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are marking up the long overdue articles of impeachment against Alejandro Mayorkas holding him accountable for his breach of the public trust and willful refusal to enforce our laws. Mayorkas and Joe Biden have failed the American people, and Secretary Mayorkas is responsible for the devastation and destruction and the implementation of the failed Biden border policies that have led to a crisis in states and communities nationwide. Our country is experiencing a full fledged invasion with illegal immigrants pouring across our borders in record numbers encouraged by Joe Biden’s open border policies. Since stepping foot in the Oval Office, there have been over 8.3 million illegal crossings nationwide. Over 360 of those individuals are on the terrorist watch list. And this crisis is not going away. December marked the highest single month of illegal immigrant encounters at our Southern Border in history.

From the Northern to the Southern Border, every single community has been turned into a border community and destroyed countless American families in the process. Whether that's through fentanyl poisoning, rising crime, or displacing American students and taxpayers, like a school in New York. The Biden border crisis has created the most pressing humanitarian, national security, and homeland crisis in our nation’s history. In the last three months, just in the Northern Border which I represent in my district. The Northern Border has seen more illegal crossings than the total of both 2021 and 2022 combined, yet, you have Far Left leaders like New York Governor Kathy Hochul trying to force New York taxpayers to shovel out 2.4 billion dollars to subsidize Joe Biden’s border crisis.

Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and Far Left Democrats have failed the American people making their priorities crystal clear: Illegal Immigrants come first. American families last in Joe Biden’s America.

House Republicans will not sit idly by while Joe Biden and Extreme Democrats refuse to do their job. In addition to pursuing the impeachment of Mayorkas, we are bringing four important bills to the floor this week committed to addressing Biden’s Border Crisis.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Harvard's Election Interference
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement after reports that Harvard University was creating barriers for entry into their Board of Overseers election process.

"The very public fall of Harvard continues in disgrace as it has recently come to my attention that Harvard is now inappropriately interfering with the election of the Board of Overseers to block candidates who are not self-selected by the current failed Harvard leadership.

After multiple candidates stepped up to run to save Harvard from its current failed, morally bankrupt leadership, Harvard is not only arbitrarily moving the goalposts of the Board of Overseers election process, it is suppressing the vote by adding in unprecedented complex roadblocks to limit participation - all of this happening with 0% transparency behind closed doors in hopes that the public won't take notice.

If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it is: the desperate radical Far Left rigs the system when they know they can't win.

If Harvard thinks their stonewalling of the Congressional investigation will protect them from accountability, they are mistaken. On the contrary, the list of egregious acts by Harvard meriting Congressional oversight keeps growing and growing. They continue to dig deeper into the morass of moral bankruptcy shredding academic integrity all while maintaining an arrogant sense of entitlement. The reality is that Higher Education institutions like Harvard rely on billions of dollars of US taxpayer funds. It is our responsibility on behalf of the American people that we have full transparency in the governance structure (in this case a failed one) of these institutions and deliver accountability and much needed reforms."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Sunday Morning Futures To Discuss the Impeachment of DHS Secretary Mayorkas, the Biden Border Crisis, Ensuring Election Integrity, The Biden Impeachment Inquiry, And Much More
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joins Maria Bartiromo onSunday Morning Futuresto discuss the newly released articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the effect the Biden border crisis is having on New York, Extreme Democrats’ weaponization of the judicial system to keep President Trump off the ballot, the Biden impeachment inquiry, and combating antisemitism in higher education.

Watch her full interview here.

Find highlights from her interview below.

On the Articles Of Impeachment Against Sec. Mayorkas:

“Well, this is very important as House Republicans are the last line of defense, and we are holding the Biden Administration and Joe Biden accountable for the catastrophe at our Southern Border. Our Committee Chair, Mark Green of Homeland Security, has done a tremendous job and has shown to the American people that there has been a willful and refusal to comply with the law and an abuse of power in the position as Secretary of Homeland Security. You have a wide open border. It is the number one issue for Americans across the country. And it’s not just the border states, Maria, who are impacted. It’s my home state of New York as well. Every state is a border state. So the Committee will mark up those articles of impeachment and work through the process to bring them to the floor. And I think what is most telling is Democrats are refusing to hold Joe Biden accountable for this border crisis that Joe Biden and his Cabinet have created.”

On How The Biden Border Crisis Is Impacting New York:

“Yes because it’s not just the Southern Border. We’ve seen an 800 percent increase in the Swanton Sector, which is the part of the Northern Border that I represent, of illegal crossings. And Kathy Hochul was not included in the Governors who were providing support to the Southern Border. Meanwhile, she is begging for relief despite the fact that New York is a sanctuary state and New York City is a sanctuary city where Democrats rolled out the red carpet for illegals. Now, we are seeing that it’s an issue not just on the Southern Border but the Northern Border as well. And this is having real impacts on people’s lives, Maria. Just last week we saw in New York State a high school in New York City sent the kids home, sent U.S. students home to house illegal immigrants. This is a catastrophe. Voters will and we must hold Joe Biden accountable.”

On President Trump’s Successes Compared To Joe Biden’s Failures:

“It is clear to Americans that we had economic success. We had a secure border. We had strength around the world. We are seeing the most unfit President under Joe Biden: weakness around the world, a wide open border, and historic ‘Bidenflation’ because of failed Biden economics.”

On Ensuring Election Integrity:

“Well, this is very important, to hold Democrats and the Far Left accountable. For example, we see that it is really egregious and the first time in history Democrats are trying to remove President Trump from the ballot. That is interfering in this election. I proudly signed onto the amicus brief standing up for Americans’ rights to make the decision at the ballot box rather than radical judges and Democrats attempting to remove him. That’s just one of many steps. In New York State alone, for example, Democrats are trying to rig and cheat and illegally gerrymander districts. We are standing strong for election integrity in New York as well. So we need to focus on all efforts to make sure that this is a secure and constitutional election.”

On The Impeachment Inquiry Into Joe Biden:

“Well, this was really bombshell reports that came out of the Kevin Morris depositions last week, and I want to credit Jamie Comer, our Chair of Oversight, who is doing a tremendous job delivering transparency to the American people. Were it not for that Committee’s work, the American people would not know that the Biden’s benefited. Joe Biden and Jill Biden benefited directly: hundreds of thousands of dollars of illegal money laundered from adversaries like Communist China. What we learned in the deposition from Kevin Morris is that Hunter Biden has six million dollars worth of loans, that Kevin Morris purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars of Hunter Biden’s terrible artwork and the fact that Kevin Morris owns ten percent of a stake in the private equity company invested in Communist China from Hunter Biden. Every American knows this is corruption at its core, and Joe Biden sits atop the Biden Crime Family. So this deposition was very important. I know the Oversight Committee is going to continue its work to deliver transparency and ultimately accountability for what I believe will be the greatest political scandal in our nation’s history with Joe Biden at the top of it.”

…

“Of course. I’ve said that Joe Biden is compromised. I’ve said that the American people know that the ‘Big Guy’– ‘Ten percent for the Big Guy’–is Joe Biden. And you are seeing a very weak foreign policy when it comes to asserting strength to counter China. We’re not seeing that from Joe Biden and the White House, and frankly, we’re not seeing any strength around the world today. So the media is trying to cover this up, the mainstream media. But again, the bank records and the checks themselves, they are the proof, Maria, that this President is compromised and corrupt.”

On Holding Higher Education Accountable for Antisemitism at Universities:

“Well, certainly it sent off an earthquake in higher education, Maria, and those university presidents, former university presidents in the case of two, sit atop institutions that have a rot and unfortunately, deep roots of antisemitism. For example, in Harvard’s case, when they announced the Antisemitic Task Force to combat antisemitism, the Chair of it is antisemitic and is known for antisemitic posts. So there’s a lot of work to do. That’s why the investigation on the Education Committee on which I serve is so, so important. And it’s not just those three institutions. It’s higher education across the board. But there will be a lot of work to make sure that we address this, to make sure these universities are held accountable.”

Title: Stefanik Statement On U.S. Servicemembers Killed By Iranian- Backed Forces
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement offering her condolences to the families of the three fallen American soldiers who died in an Iranian-backed attack against U.S. forces in the Middle East and demanding immediate action from the Biden Administration.

“I want to extend my deepest condolences to the families of the three fallen American heroes who died in an Iranian-backed attack against U.S. troops in the Middle East, bearing the ultimate sacrifice to our nation. I am also praying for the dozens of other service members who sustained injuries during the attack.

This Iranian-backed attack which resulted in devastating loss of life was predictable and avoidable. Joe Biden has allowed Iranian-backed proxies to attack U.S. troops over 150 times with little to no consequence. The weak Biden Administration is paralyzed by their fear of angering Tehran. However, the reality is that Joe Biden’s strategy of appeasement has emboldened Tehran, eroded American deterrence, and caused the situation in the region to escalate leading to the tragic deaths of U.S. service members.

The U.S. must respond to this attack swiftly and decisively and return to President Trump’s Maximum Pressure Campaign against Tehran. We can only achieve peace through strength.”

East Greenbush, N.Y. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletterto Far Left Governor Kathy Hochul urging her to join the 25 governors across our country that have pledged support to Texas Governor Greg Abbott in his efforts to secure the U.S. Southern Border.

Nearly $2 billion taxpayer dollars have been spent on New York City’s illegal immigration crisis with the costs expected to rise to over $12 billion in Fiscal Year 2025. Meanwhile, America Last Hochul proposed a state budget that includes cuts to New York State schools in order for taxpayers to keep funding the influx of illegal immigrants arriving to take advantage of Hochul’s sanctuary city policies.

“Far Left Kathy Hochul has openly admitted that New York taxpayers cannot afford to continue subsidizing the illegal immigrants pouring in through our borders because of Joe Biden’s disastrous open border policies. She has the opportunity here and now to stand with Governor Greg Abbott as he works tirelessly to secure Texas’s border and secure our country from this invasion Joe Biden has unforgivably encouraged,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Kathy Hochul has a duty to every New Yorker to ensure their safety and security and right now she is miserably failing them.”

“Antisemitism should not be tolerated anywhere. Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration is failing to adequately address antisemitism inside the federal government. The VA’s abysmal response is unacceptable and I am proud to join Chairman Bost in demanding that the VA fully comply with our request for a robust investigation into Ms. Morrad’s appalling actions,”Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said. “As it stands, Ms. Morrad cannot be trusted to fairly administer the benefits of Jewish veterans when she is on the record spewing awful antisemitic hate towards the Jewish people.”

In December 2023, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Chairman Mike Bost led aletterto the VA calling for a full investigation into the antisemitic actions of Shekeba Morrad. The VA responded to this letter and stated that they put Shekeba Morrad through a routine “harassment prevention and accountability training,” and would not hold her accountable for her actions.

Title: Stefanik Statement on UNRWA Employees Involvement in October 7th Attacks

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement followingreportsthat United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employees were directly involved in the October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.

“It is absolutely shameful and unacceptable that employees at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) had a direct role in the barbaric October 7th attacks against Israel. UNRWA is supposed to be a humanitarian agency, yet their employees are supporting Hamas in its goal to eradicate the Israeli state and carry out genocide against the Jewish people. Unfortunately, this is another devastating consequence of the Biden Administration’s complete incompetence. In 2021, Joe Biden reversed President Trump’s decision to cut off U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to the antisemitic UNRWA. For the last three years Joe Biden’s decision to send U.S. taxpayer dollars to Gaza with no oversight and no accountability has allowed for the proliferation of abhorrent and antisemitic educational materials to be used across Gaza and filled the coffers of Hamas. Now we are finding out that their employees who are funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars were directly involved in the abhorrent October 7th attacks. The Biden Administration’s limited suspension of funds to UNRWA to cover up for their disastrous mistake is unacceptable. Joe Biden must permanently cut off all funding to this antisemitic and violent organization.”

Find the full opinion below.

New Yorkers Want American Energy Dominance

By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik

As the Representative of New York’s 21st Congressional District, it is my duty to bring the concerns of my constituents to the highest levels of government, and in recent weeks, I have once again heard the growing anxiety from Upstate New York and North Country families, including some of the133,000 seniors on fixed incomes, farmers, and small businesses who are concerned about increased heating costs this winter. With NY21 already experiencing storms that have left thousands without power and theFarmers' Almanacpredicting yet another freezing-cold, stormy, and snowy winter, I am focused on passing legislation to lower energy costs for hardworking North Country families.

The completely out-of-touch failed Biden Administration has made matters worse for Upstate New Yorkers and Americans across the country with President Biden’s radical Far Left Green New Deal agenda. Joe Biden's war on American energy, which ended our country’s energy independence and caused energy prices for hardworking Americans and fixed-income seniors to skyrocket to historic levels.

President Biden committed to destroying American energy dominance on the very first day of his presidency when he halted the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline instantly killing thousands of American energy jobs and preventing United States refineries from receiving up to830,000 barrelsof Canadian oil each day. I had proudly supported authorizing this pipeline as one of my first votes in Congress because I knew it would help reduce energy costs for Americans while enhancing our energy independence and strengthening our economic partnership with Canada.

Biden’s war on American energy has not only caused energy prices to skyrocket for Americans, but it has jeopardized our national security by taking extraordinary steps to prevent oil and gas drilling permits on federal lands and waters. LastSeptember, the Biden Administration released plans for the smallest auction of offshore drilling rights ever. In a desperate attempt to alleviate the pain Americans were experiencing because of his radical Green New Deal agenda and war on American energy, President Biden drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its lowest level since 1984.

Here in Upstate New York and the North Country, we rely heavily on home heating oil, which is derived from crude oil, to heat our homes. In November 2020, during President Trump’s historic presidency, the cost of home heating oil in New York was$2.41 per gallon. In November 2023, only three years later, the cost skyrocketed to$4.43 per gallon- a whopping 83.6% under President Biden.  The sky high utility and heating bills are crushing hundreds of thousands of Upstate families especially the hundreds of thousand fixed-income seniors in my district, many of whom are veterans.

The American people have had enough of Biden’s failed radical Green New Deal agenda and his war on American energy, which they know are to blame for our sky-high energy costs. That is why our district and the country elected House Republicans to the majority in 2022 to fight Joe Biden’s war on American energy, unleash American energy dominance, and drive down energy costs for hardworking Americans.

Since gaining the majority, House Republicans have hit the ground running. We passedH.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which unleashes American energy and lowers costs by increasing domestic energy production, reforming the permitting process for all industries, and reversing the anti-energy policies advanced by the Biden Administration. We also passed legislation that would prohibit our SPR from being used for reasons other than a severe energy supply interruption.

I will continue to advocate for American energy independence to lower energy prices for every family, farmer, and small business in our district.

Title: Stefanik Statement on Education and the Workforce Letter to UPenn

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the Education and the Workforce Committee’sletterto University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Board of Trustees Chairman Ramanan Raghavendran and Interim President Dr. Larry Jameson requesting documents and information regarding UPenn’s inadequate response to instances of antisemitism on its campus and its failure to protect Jewish students, faculty, and staff.

“With House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx leading the investigation into UPenn’s abysmal response to instances of blatant antisemitism on its campuses, I have the utmost confidence that we will root out the source of this evil and bring those responsible for its proliferation into the light of day. UPenn must cooperate with our investigation and understand our focus on making sure Jewish students, faculty, and staff are safe from antisemitism.”

On December 5th, 2023, Stefanikquestionedthe presidents of UPenn, Harvard University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, regarding their failure to condemn antisemitism and anti-Israel rhetoric on campus, as well as their refusal to say whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” is bullying and harassment according to their codes of conduct. Following the university presidents’ testimonies, Stefanik demanded the immediate resignation of all three presidents.

Title: Stefanik Statement on Harvard’s Continued Failure to Protect Jewish Students & Unacceptable Appointment on Antisemitism Task Force
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on Harvard University’s decision to appoint Derek Penslar as co-chair of their Antisemitism Task Force continuing a disturbing trend of failing to protect Jewish and Israeli students and community members on campus.

“Harvard has become a disgraced bastion for antisemitism,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Not only did Harvard’s leadership allow antisemitism to rage on campus as Jewish students faced incessant harassment and physical assaults, they have now shown willful negligence by appointing Derek Penslar as the co-chair to their Antisemitism Task Force. Derek Penslar is known for his despicable antisemitic views and statements. Only weeks before the deadly October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel, Penslar signed a letter that called our great ally Israel “a regime of apartheid.” The indefensible decision to appoint Penslar to a task force meant to investigate antisemitism will undoubtedly lead to the undermining of this task force’s mission. It is disturbing that Harvard’s leadership continues down this path of complete and total failure to stand up for the rights and safety of Jewish and Israeli students.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Joe Biden's Weaker Terrorist Designation of Iranian-Backed Houthi Terrorists
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.-House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement in response to the Biden Administration’s decision to designate Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists” versus relisting them as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization” (FTO) which carries much more significant sanctions and penalties. Joe Biden’s decision to choose a weaker designation is the most recent example of the Biden Administration’s appeasement of Iran.

“Joe Biden weakened our national security when he recklessly repealed President Trump’s strong decision to designate Houthis as a terrorist organization. Since then, I have repeatedly called for Joe Biden to take immediate action and relist the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. American service members continue to face sustained attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants. Yet, Joe Biden is the weakest U.S. president as he continues to pander to Tehran, refusing to officially relist the Iranian-backed Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and announcing half-measure sanctions, despite the Houthis carrying out over 20 missile and drone attacks against U.S. commercial and warships. This failure is yet another example of the extreme weakness of Joe Biden and the Biden Administration on the global stage.”

In January 2021, President Trump listedthe Houthis as a FTO ensuring that they were cut off from their Iranian sponsors. Immediately after Joe Biden came to office hereversedthis decision and delisted the Houthis. Three years after this decision, the Biden Administrationdesignatedthe Houthis as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists.”This weak designation implements limited sanctions on the terrorists. By refusing to return to a FTO designation, support for the Houthis is not criminalized, it does not force banks to seize Houthi assets, and allows Houthis to still freely travel to the U.S.

GOP Reps: Biden's New Rule Rips Freedom Away from Workers, Small Businesses

By House Republican Chair Elise Stefanik (NY-21) and Congressman Rick Allen (GA-12)

Under the Trump administration, small businesses were booming, the spirit of entrepreneurship was thriving, and the U.S. economy experienced unprecedented growth. As representatives of small business-driven communities, we are alarmed at the Biden administration's weaponization of the Department of Labor against American entrepreneurs.

American small business owners will tell you that flexibility in the workplace is key to achieving their American Dream. Be it a mom-and-pop shop in Plattsburgh, New York, or a subcontractor in Statesboro, Georgia, our business owners' investment in our communities rests on their ability to design business models that best suit their lifestyles and businesses. This empowerment leads to more opportunities, greater productivity, and an increase in the overall well-being of our workforce.

Far too often, however, overbearing and misguided federal policies get in the way of good, hard-working Americans simply trying to provide for their families. Once again, PresidentJoe Bidenand far-LeftDemocratsare seeking to hamper job creation, entrepreneurship, and growth in our local communities with a new Labor Department rule that will overly restrict American job creators and devastate millions of workers.

Small business people, from carpenters, electricians, and mechanics to photographers, wedding vendors, and more, rely on the flexibility of the independent contractor model and gig economy to make a living. Unfortunately, President Biden and radical Democrats are seeking to strip this flexibility from the modern worker. Last week, President Biden's Labor Department finalized an unclear, overly restrictive independent contractor rule that will have devastating impacts on millions of workers and thousands of businesses at a time of record inflation and a stumbling U.S. economy.

Biden's rule on independent contractors circumventsCongress, the people's representation, to enact a disastrous policy similar to that inCalifornia's Assembly Bill 5(AB5) and theProtecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. AB5, enacted in January 2020, led to countless Californians who were working as freelance employees losing their income mere weeks before the COVID pandemic. The radical PRO Act would take away independent contractors' ability to work how they see fit. Taking these failed far-Left policies nationwide would devastate millions of American businesses by depriving individuals of entrepreneurial opportunities, the ability to set their own hours, and the flexibility to care for their families the way it suits them.

In a Workforce Protections Subcommitteehearingexamining the independent contractor model, Karen Anderson, the founder of Freelancers Against AB5, told stories of the threat that AB5 and similar federal legislation, including the PRO Act, pose to independent contractors. "I received stories about children's theaters closing; local bar bands ceasing to perform; professional Santas being laid off; writers being let go from publications; and court reporters suddenly without assignments," said Ms. Anderson. "To name a few."

We will not stand idly by as Biden's tyrannical administration seeks to take power from the hands of small business owners and entrepreneurs across America. That's why we are calling for Congress to pass theEmployee Rights Act, which will provide essential protections for workers' rights, choices, and freedoms in the 21st-century economy.

More specifically, the Employee Rights Act includes theModern Worker Empowerment Act, which would create a clear definition and standard acrossfederal laws to protect independent workers. By creating consistency and clarity with respect to employee and independent contractor status, these bills would provide certainty for workers, job creators, and federal agencies in making classification determinations, ensuring workers' choice and flexibility is protected from Biden's independent contractor rule.

The American Dream, while different for everyone, must be attainable for all. Unsurprisingly, far-Left Democrats continue to push severe federal regulations to impose an employment model—and in turn union contracts—on independent workers for political gain. Rather than creating burdensome regulations that pigeonhole workers, our government should be focused on creating policy that empowers American workers and gives them the tools needed to succeed.

Americans overwhelmingly support freedom and flexibility when it comes to running their businesses. It's time Congress delivers American businesses nationwide a win by adopting the Employee Rights Act.

Title: Stefanik Statement on Far Left Kathy Hochul’s Delusional $233B Budget Plan
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement following Far Left Kathy Hochul’s massive $233 billion budget announcement for the State of New York.

“Far Left failed Democrat Governor Kathy Hochul wants to spend taxpayer money that New York doesn’t have on failed policies that New Yorkers do not want. Her bloated budget pours $2.4 billion into funding and further incentivizes the illegal immigration crisis. She fails to address the failed sanctuary city policies that are bankrupting New York City and displacing our public school students in the process. Hochul shamelessly won’t consider repealing her own extremist soft-on-crime policies that have rewarded violent criminals and punished victims. The hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers fleeing the state will tell you exactly how out of touch Hochul and Albany Democrats are with the needs of New Yorkers. Kathy Hochul has once again decided to saddle hardworking New Yorkers with debt while offering zero remedies for the problems that plague them living in her socialist nightmare.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Trump’s Historic Victory In Iowa, Standing With Israel, & Defending The Unborn’s Right to Life
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined House Republican leadership to discuss President Donald J. Trump’s historic Iowa caucus victory, how House Republicans will continue to stand unequivocally with our most precious ally Israel, and how House Republicans will continue to fight to ensure every baby has the sacred opportunity of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the transcript of her remarks below.

“First, I want to take a moment to congratulate President Donald Trump on his historic win in Iowa, earning more votes than all the other candidates combined. The people of Iowa spoke loudly and clearly echoing the sentiment felt throughout the rest of our country. America is rallying in support of President Trump to save America and fire Joe Biden.

Yesterday, I had the honor of meeting with Israeli Ambassador Herzog. This past Sunday marked 100 days since the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel - the bloodiest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. House Republicans will continue to stand unequivocally with Israel. House Republicans passed a robust aid package under Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership, and yet, Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer continue to fail to deliver support to our most precious ally.

This week, House Republicans will welcome hundreds of thousands of our constituents proudly participating in the March for Life. The most important and meaningful title I have ever had in my life is “Mom.” We will continue to fight every day to ensure every baby has the sacred opportunity of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, life is under constant attack by the radical, Far Left Democrats. There have now been over 88 recorded acts of violence and intimidation against pregnancy centers, churches, and pro-life organizations by Far Left activists. These facilities were set ablaze, defaced, and vandalized. And what have we heard from Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington? Silence.

Under the leadership of House Republicans, we passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and a resolution condemning attacks on these pro-life facilities, groups, and churches following the Dobbs decision.

In continuation of our commitment to defending life, this week, House Republicans will bring to the floor the Pregnant Students’ Rights Act and the Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act to support critical pregnancy resource centers and provide necessary information to pregnant students combating manipulation by the Far Left’s radical, pro-abortion agenda.”

Title: Stefanik, Gallagher Joint Statement Demanding Ban on Communist Chinese Drones in the US
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. -House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik and Select Committee on the CCP Chairman Mike Gallagher released the following joint statement demanding that Communist Chinese drones be banned from the United States. This comes after the release of the new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)reportdetailing how Communist Chinese drones are actively spying on America’s critical infrastructure and present a legitimate national security threat.

“The new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencyreportmakes clear that Communist Chinese drones present a legitimate national security risk to our critical infrastructure and must be banned from the U.S.,”the lawmakers stated.“The CCP has subsidized drone companies such as DJI and Autel in order to destroy American competition and spy on America’s critical infrastructure sites. We must ban CCP-backed spy drones from America and work to bolster the U.S. drone industry.”

Stefanik and Gallagher have fought to highlight the credible threats of Communist Chinese drones. In April 2023, Stefanik and Gallagher introduced theCountering CCP Drones Act,legislation which adds Chinese drone company Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) to the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Covered List, meaning that DJI technologies would be prohibited from operating on U.S. communications infrastructure. In December, Stefanikleda letter along with Gallagher to the Secretary of the Defense demanding oversight into the Department of Defense’s role allowing American companies to export critical components to Communist Chinese drone manufacturer, DJI.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins The Morgan Ortagus Show to Discuss Sec. Austin’s Lack of Transparency, Antisemitism on College Campuses, and the Biden Border Crisis
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined The Morgan Ortagus Show on Sirius XM Patriot to discuss why Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin must resign over his lack of transparency, the House’s investigation into antisemitism at higher ed institutions, the impeachment proceedings against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and much more.

Listen to her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Secretary Austin’s Lack of Transparency:

“Well, I still think we're getting answers about what happened, Morgan, and I will tell you. I know you know this from your senior, national security positions. I know this as a member of Congress and particularly, a senior member on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. It is truly unthinkable and really shocking that the Secretary of Defense was undergoing major medical treatment, was out of contact, and did not notify the President, the National Security Council, the White House, and even the Deputy Secretary at the Pentagon, who was on vacation, was unaware. This creates a very concerning lack of continuity of government. And I'll tell you as you look around the world today, we are facing so many threats. And in my district, I represent the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, the most deployed division in the U.S. Army since 9/11. Currently, we have over 1,000 soldiers deployed in the Middle East. So to think that as American servicemembers are being targeted by Iranian-backed terrorists and by Iran that we have the Secretary of Defense who is essentially AWOL and out of contact, that is unacceptable. I've called for his resignation. And the White House, you have seen, has put out very concerning rhetoric and statements from the podium. They've asked every Cabinet Secretary to put forth very specific plans when it comes to communicating with the White House, continuity of government. And it's why the House Armed Services Committee is conducting a formal inquiry into the lack of transparency. But I'm sure, Morgan, you find it shocking, just given your senior level experience in the Trump Administration in the national security space. This is unthinkable.”

On Claudine Gay’s Resignation and the House Investigations into Antisemitism At Harvard and Other Higher Ed Institutions:

“Well, you know me well, Morgan, because I was shocked, and I was really astonished in real time. And I’ve been in a lot of Congressional hearings over the past decade, and I’ve never heard more morally bankrupt testimony than at that hearing. And there is a reason that it is now the most viewed Congressional testimony in history of the United States Congress with over one billion views in just a week. It’s now multiple billions, and that’s because of the pathetic answers from those three “elite” university presidents. Just to take your listeners into the room, that was the last question of the hearing. Previously in the hearing, I had asked the Harvard President questions. I was not getting direct answers. And I thought to myself, I asked the most junior member of our committee, a new freshman: ‘If you have extra time, can you yield it to me because I want to ask one final, moral question?’ And I tried to ask it in a way, Morgan, that would force and elicit a ‘Yes’ answer which is why I asked, very straightforward, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct on bullying and harassment?’ And I started with MIT thinking MIT is a technical school, they’re not as liberal in many ways or, sort of, they haven’t embraced this woke policythat Harvard and Penn. I was expecting MIT to say, ‘Yes it does violate our university’s code of conduct.’ And to my astonishment, all three university presidents said, ‘It depends on the context’. And you heard Penn even go a step further and say, and ‘It’s dependent upon the conduct’. You see my response to each of them in addition to the shock. I said, ‘It does not depend on the context, and this is absolutely unacceptable.’ And that's why I've called for their resignations. What you cannot see in the video, but it's important for your listeners and really, for everyone around the world to know this is, we have Jewish students from each of those schools who attended the hearing, and I could see them from where I was seated at the top of the dais, but they were not in a video shot. I could see how absolutely shaken and just so pained they were by these pathetic answers, these morally bankrupt answers of the presidents of the universities that they themselves attend. So this obviously set off an earthquake in higher education that has been long overdue. And our investigation is going to be robust. It's already ongoing. You know, after the hearing, it led to the forced resignation of the Penn President and then later after about a month, the Harvard President, and certainly the MIT President should also resign as well. But there is a lot more work to do from my perspective. This is when the work really begins. And that means looking at these universities when it comes to their failed records. We put out document requests regarding their failure to address the rise of antisemitism on college campuses, the DEI offices’ failure to stand up for and protect Jewish students. DEI offices, which are, by definition, antisemitic. The foreign funding piece which is very important to look at. And then of course, the U.S. taxpayer dollar funds. Billions of dollars of US taxpayer funds go to these higher ed institutions. We need to have oversight and address this, so a lot of work ahead. I'm engaged in this every single day.”

On The Rise of Antisemitism In The Democrat Party:

“Well, you know, unfortunately, Morgan, we know that antisemitism is a historic challenge. But it's really bubbling over in the surface, and certainly in my lifetime, I've never seen what we're seeing today, whether it's on college campuses, whether it's in the halls of Congress, frankly, with this rise of antisemitism within the Democrat Party, from members of The Squad. And, you know, it should not be difficult to take a vote to condemn antisemitism in Congress, and yet, over 100 Democrats voted against that resolution condemning antisemitism. I think the Biden Administration needs to be much more strong when it comes to their support of Israel and call out those in the Democrat Party who are contributing to this rise in antisemitism. And they have refused to do that. For example, they should have pushed hard to make sure every Democrat voted for that resolution to condemn antisemitism. And you saw, as I said, over 100 Democrats did not. And I will tell you, while the White House Press Secretary condemned the university presidents, we did not hear from the President of the United States himself, Joe Biden, and he is a former professor at Penn, and he should have spoken out. Instead, what we saw, for example, some prominent Democrat leaders like Barack Obama was pleading with Harvard University to keep the president, who, now former president, who put that, you know, historically morally bankrupt testimony into the record. So there's so much work that needs to be done in the national security space, I will tell you, we are absolutely committed to making sure that our most precious ally, Israel has the resources and support they need. And I've been proud to do that on the House Armed Services Committee and proud to do that on the Education Committee as well. But there's so much work to do. I will also tell you, I've introduced legislation that was signed into law, the Never Again Holocaust Education Act, which is for K-12 schools to make sure that there's federal grant monies available for teaching the historic lessons of the Holocaust because never again is now. And we need to, obviously, do so much more work in educating our young people especially.”

On Joe Biden’s Failed, Far Left Open Border Policies:

“The border crisis, I will tell you, is the number one issue, that and inflation, those are the number one issues that I hear from in my district, and the border crisis, every state is a border state. We say that because we mean it and New York, we've just seen the catastrophe that Biden's failed border policies have caused. In New York, you even have Democrat mayors like Eric Adams, there in New York City, speaking out so loudly critical of Joe Biden's Presidency. And the sad irony there, Morgan, is that same Democrat Mayor also advocated for sanctuary city policies and sanctuary state policies in New York which have, you know, led to this border crisis. The fact that this week you had students dismissed and moved towards online learning to allow the school to house 2,000 illegal immigrants, it is fundamentally unAmerican. It is unbelievable. We know the significant learning loss that results from students when they're not able to be in the classroom. And actually, it's very important to point out House Republicans passed a bill to not allow illegals to be housed in our schools. And you know what, Chuck Schumer refused to take up that bill in the Senate. But we passed that bill barring that in the House, and we're very proud to have gotten that done. We passed that months ago. And it's not just the crisis from the Southern Border, Morgan, I represent a large swath of the U.S. Canadian Border in New York State. And we've seen a nearly 800% increase in illegal crossings on the U.S. Canadian Border in the sector that I represent, including individuals who are on the terror watchlist coming not just across our Southern Border, but our Northern Border as well. We passed the Secure The Border Act, House Republicans did, and unfortunately, not a single Democrat voted for it. But we know the policies that work. Those are President Trump's border policies. And that was the most secure border in my lifetime, and we need to return to those policies. So this is an issue that's not going away for Democrats. They see this in the polling. 84% of New Yorkers, for example, think the border is a crisis, and New York is traditionally a blue state. So a lot of those people answering yes, it's a crisis, are registered Democrats. We will secure the border when we win back the Senate and win back the White House, but House Republicans have done our job.”

On House Republicans Holding Mayorkas and the Biden Administration Accountable:

“It will have an effect. We have a responsibility in our oversight capacity to hold these administrations and departments accountable when they're failing to do their job. In Secretary Mayorkas’ case, he is failing to execute the law. He is testifying under oath that our border is secure. The failed policies of Joe Biden that are being executed by Secretary Mayorkas as the Homeland Security Secretary have literally led to the deaths of Americans in the fentanyl overdoses. If you look, that's the leading cause of death of young American adults aged 18 to 35 in this country, and yet you have Secretary Myorkas saying that the border is secure. Americans are smart. They see through that, but it's our job to hold the secretaries and departments accountable. And we're doing that.”

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik made the following statement 100 days after the brutal October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel.“Exactly 100 days ago, the Jewish people experienced the bloodiest day since the Holocaust when Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and brutally murdered over 1,200 innocent civilians in cold blood. These barbaric terrorists used sexual violence as a weapon of war against Israeli women and girls and took hundreds of men, women, babies, and elderly victims as hostages, ripping them away from their families and loved ones. Today, as Israel continues its war to eradicate Hamas, over one hundred hostages are still held by Hamas in Gaza. As a mother, wife, daughter, and sister my heart breaks for the hostages and their families for the unspeakable pain they are enduring every day. House Republicans stand with our great ally Israel and we will do everything in our power to provide them the resources to return every last hostage and protect their nation.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Op-Ed in North Country Now: Protect Milk Choice in Schools

Protect Milk Choice in Schools

By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik

As we celebrate National Milk Day, I am especially grateful to our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country who work tirelessly to provide our communities with delicious and nutritious milk. I will always fight to increase our children’s and families’ access to milk so that they can receive the essential nutrients that milk provides.

Last month, I was proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle topassthe bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act on the House floor. This legislation will allow school cafeterias to serve whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free flavored and unflavored milk in cafeterias, giving our kids a variety of milk choices.

School nutrition programs provide students across the country with critical access to healthy meals, including nutritious flavored and unflavored milk. In fact, school meals provide 77 percent of total daily milk consumption and 70 percent of total dairy consumption for low-income children ages 5-18.

According to theDietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, the vast majority of school-age children do not meet the recommended levels of dairy consumption and therefore are not receiving the essential nutrients that milk provides for growth and development. The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will secure a variety of milk choices for our school children, including whole milk, ensuring that our children have more options to receive the crucial nutrients milk provides. Increasing milk access for our growing children is vital, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate to get this legislation signed into law.

When New York City Mayor Eric Adams tried to ban chocolate milk in schools, Iledthe successful bipartisan effort to fight back against this draconian policy.

Last year, Iintroducedthe Protecting School Milk Choices Act, legislation that would ensure schools participating in the National School Lunch Program offer students at least one flavored milk option. Any effort by New York City Mayor Adams to ban chocolate milk and replace it with vegan juice is an absolute non-starter and will be met by my opposition on behalf of New York’s hardworking dairy farmers and families.

Furthermore, I am proud toleadthe charge in protecting flavored milk in schools nationwide in response to USDA’s recentlyproposed ruleto potentially ban it. I am deeply concerned with USDA’s latest attempt at potentially restricting our children’s access to flavored milk in schools. USDA’s proposed rule, which updates the nutrition standards for school meals, threatens the ability of schools to offer flavored milk by limiting added sugars to less than 10 percent of calories per week and potentially banning flavored milk in schools for grades K-8.

I remain deeply concerned with how these top-down regulations will affect our schools’ abilities to provide flavored milk for children. While schools struggle to adhere to the burdensome mandates, flavored milk may be one of the first items schools will be forced to cut.

This proposal is unacceptable, and I will do everything in my power to stop these efforts. The Biden Administration must continue to allow flavored milk for all grade levels, kindergarten through high school. Our children are currently not consuming the recommended levels of dairy, and this proposal from the Biden Administration will exacerbate this concerning deficiency by placing further restrictions on milk in schools.

We must ensure that children have access to milk choices in schools and the nutrients they provide. I urge the Biden Administration to exclude flavored milk from the weekly added sugars limit in order to ensure our children have access to the nutrients they need for growth and development. On behalf of our families and dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country, I urge the Biden Administration to let our students drink chocolate milk!

I am incredibly honored to serve you as your Congresswoman in NY-21, and I will always lead the effort to ensure our school children have access to milk choices in schools. Our children wouldn’t be able to enjoy milk’s nutritious benefits without our hardworking dairy farmers tirelessly producing milk every single day. On this National Milk Day, be sure to thank a dairy farmer for all they do for our families and communities across the nation.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik New York Post Op-Ed: "Penn, Harvard firings just the start — House will expose ALL the higher-ed rot"
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik published anop-edin theNew York Posthighlighting how the resignations of the presidents of Harvard and Penn are just the beginning of “a reckoning” and outlining the next steps in the ongoing congressional investigation into the rot plaguing America’s higher education.

Read House Republican Chairwoman Stefanik’s full op-ed below.

New York Post: Penn, Harvard firings just the start — House will expose ALL the higher-ed rot

By House Republican Chairwoman Elise Stefanik

It has been over a month since I asked the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and Penn whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their campus codes of conduct on bullying and harassment. Their dithering and morally bankrupt answers were so shocking that the video went globally viral with billions of views becoming the most viewed congressional testimony of all time.

What are the ramifications of a hearing viewed billions of times? A reckoning. The forced resignation of two Ivy League presidents is just the beginning. The problem was never just about three people or even three universities. Their attempt to contextualize genocide of Jews was merely a symptom of decades of moral decay, intellectual laziness, and dangerous radical groupthink at elite institutions across society. Replacing the wallpaper is not enough when there is deep rot within the walls.

To remove that rot, we first need to keep exploring how deep it goes. That’s why my colleagues and I on the House Education and Workforce Committee under the leadership of Chairwoman Virginia Foxx are conducting an extensive oversight investigation into numerous colleges and universities, including Harvard and its governance body, the Harvard Corporation which backed the failed leadership of former President Gay and has done nothing to combat the dangerous antisemitism on campus.

For one, we want to understand their actions over the past months such as their failure to protect Jewish students and the blatant attempt to cover up Claudine Gay’s plagiarism. We know the Harvard Corporation acted in bad faith multiple times, including by sending a letter to the New York Post threatening legal action if it reported the facts. We’re going to deliver transparency and find out why.

More than that, we will get to the bottom of the broader lack of moral clarity made clear by the reluctance to address the rise of antisemitism. Much of this, we know, is the fruit of DEI, a radical racist ideology that classifies all people as either oppressors or oppressed based purely on their race, gender, or sexual orientation. As a result of this disgusting ideology’s takeover of campuses, it is now mainstream to teach that capitalism is racist, Israel is racist, and American is racist. And these colleges received billions of hard earned taxpayer dollars in federal funds.

Led by Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, the Education and Workforce Committee is going to explore this. We’re hiring investigators and dedicating extensive resources to uncovering how deep this goes and who is behind it. We’re looking at foreign donations to our universities, the failure to protect Jewish students, the federal accreditation system, the assault on viewpoint diversity and free speech, the erosion in academic integrity, and the extent to which taxpayers have been forced to bankroll the political indoctrination of young Americans at these institutions.

We’ll make the results of this investigation known to the public so they can see colleges and universities for what they are, not what they pretend to be. We know President Biden will refuse to sign meaningful reforms, but that won’t stop us from putting them forward, even if it means setting the table for the next Republican Administration under President Trump. We’ll also signal to states how they can move the needle now, particularly with regard to state universities.

I’ve been somewhat heartened to see initial actions already taken to scale back DEI and call out institutionalized antisemitism. Some states like Florida and Texas have taken measures to ban DEI in public education. Since the hearing, there are encouraging signs even in the unlikeliest places—like the mainstream media—that the conversation is turning, which is significant, because the only way DEI has survived this long is through a climate of fear that suppresses conversation and criticism.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and we’re going to continue shining light on the rot in the university system—not just at Harvard, MIT, and Penn, but colleges and universities across the nation. In my home state of New York, that includes the likes of NYU, Columbia, and Cornell.

We must never forget that these institutions exist to serve and benefit society. When they no longer serve that purpose, the best way to change them is to expose them. The hearing last month proved it, and we’ve only just begun. And as everyone knows, I will not be deterred in this important mission.

Title: Stefanik Helps Introduce Bill to Address Doctor Shortage
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik helped introduce theDirecting our Country's Transfer of Residency Slots (DOCTORS) Act. This legislation addresses nationwide physician shortages by reallocating unused waivers from the Conrad 30 visa waiver program to states, like New York, that use their maximum number of waivers.

The Conrad 30 waiver program exempts foreign-born medical school graduates who came to the United States on the J-1 Visa Exchange Visitor Program from the requirement that they return to their country of origin after their visa expires. Each state is allocated 30 waivers under the program and are distributed on the condition that recipients agree to practice medicine for three years in a Health Professional Shortage Area, Medically Underserved Area, or Medically Underserved Population. In 2021, only 24 states used their maximum 30 allocated waivers, with 376 waivers going unused. New York has used all 30 waivers every year since 2002.

“As the physician shortage is expected to deepen across the U.S., our legislation will help provide rural and underserved areas with accessible, quality, and affordable healthcare,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Mitigating Upstate New York and the North Country’s physician shortage and working to close the gap in coverage remains one of my top priorities. I have long advocated for the use and success of the J-1 Visa Exchange Visitor Program in NY21 to incentivize more trained physicians to come to our most rural areas.”

“Since 2009, over 50 waivers have been given to foreign-born medical school graduates to practice in counties in my district. That’s 50 more doctors, who specialize in areas including anesthesiology, cardiology, infectious disease, internal medicine, neurology, pediatrics, psychiatry, radiology, transplants, urology, and more,”said Congressman Troy Nehls.“Reclaiming unused waivers from the previous fiscal year is a simple, common-sense approach to address the critical nationwide physician shortages, without increasing the number of visas.”

Specifically, theDOCTORS Actwill require state agencies to report to the Secretary of State how many unused waivers they retained at the end of each fiscal year. The Secretary will calculate the total unused waivers and disburse those equally back to the states that used their maximum 30 slots in the previous fiscal year, divisible by three.

Title: Stefanik Statement on the Passage of Resolution Overturning Biden’s Pro-Communist China Waiver
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted to pass a resolution to nullify Joe Biden’s Federal Highway Administration final rule, “Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Electric Vehicle Chargers.” This Congressional Review Act (CRA) forces the Biden Administration to promote American manufacturing in the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure network.

“I voted to overturn Joe Biden’s pro-Communist China rule that would undermine American businesses that have made significant investments into EV manufacturing. Biden’s waiver of the Buy America requirements empower our foreign adversaries like Communist China by pouring hard-earned American taxpayer dollars into foreign markets,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Joe Biden and his America Last agenda would sooner invest taxpayer money into Communist Chinese EV chargers than American-made products. The Buy America provision is meant to support American businesses and bolster U.S. manufacturers, neither of which this pro-Communist China Administration is interested in.”

View highlights from her interview below.

On Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul’s Decision To Displace New York Students To House Illegal Immigrants:

“It outrages every New Yorker and every American and if you look at the polling, Brian, 84 percent of New Yorkers believe that this is a border crisis. And they know it's a direct result of Joe Biden's failed policies and Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul’s failed policies when they rolled out the red carpet, claimed they're a sanctuary city, a sanctuary state. Now look at who's paying the price: hardworking New York families. And in the case of this school, over 60 percent of those kids come from economically disadvantaged families. That is unacceptable. These parents now don't know what to do. And we know there is a negative impact when you're forced to do remote learning. So it is unacceptable. House Republicans, we passed legislation not allowing illegals to displace students in our schools. The Senate needs to take it up, and we need to secure the border.”

…

These crises that Joe Biden has created, number one, which is the border crisis. It's impacting and hurting hardworking families. And that's why we're beginning the process to impeach Secretary Mayorkas.”

On The Impeachment Proceedings Against DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas:

“It focuses on how he is not taking care of our country which is a constitutional requirement for a cabinet secretary. It also focuses on the fact that he is not executing the laws. We are seeing this Administration leave a border wide open. And it's not just the policy, Brian, it's people have died as a result of the policy. If you look at the fentanyl overdoses, the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 35, that's a direct result of Joe Biden's open border. So this investigation, this impeachment inquiry, is so important to bring transparency to the American people who already know this is a border crisis but to deliver much needed accountability.”

On the House Investigations into Antisemitism At Harvard and Other Higher Ed Institutions:

“So this is the beginning of a very robust investigation. On Monday of this week, the head of the committee put out a document request to Harvard. They have two weeks to comply. The questions are very in depth about how they address the rise of antisemitism on campus, whether it was disciplinary action taken. We're also looking at the offices of DEI where we know at Harvard, hundreds of students reached out, Jewish students who are concerned about the rise of antisemitism, they got zero response. Importantly, it's also looking at governance, the Harvard Corporation, who tried to brush this under the rug. And the fact that they tried to cover up the plagiarism scandal which is very much tied into this because we discovered that with the scrutiny that was much deserved of Claudine Gay.”

On the need for Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Resign:

“Look at the scandal right now with the Secretary of Defense. I represent thousands of troops from Fort Drum, the 10th Mountain Division, who are deployed in the Middle East right now. It is unacceptable that you have a Secretary of Defense who is not transparent with the White House. So I am looking forward to being active on that issue to deliver accountability and transparency, and I called for his resignation.”

Brian Kilmeade:“So you want him fired?”

Title: ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik On The Need For Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin's Resignation and the Biden Border Crisis
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined House Republican leadership and reiterated her call for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s resignation over his stunning lack of transparency. Stefanik also highlighted the impact that the Biden border crisis is having on America and the need to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the transcript of her remarks below.

“Good morning everyone. Welcome back. 2024 is already off to a very busy start.

I want to begin by addressing the shocking actions and lack of transparency from the Department of Defense. It is absolutely unacceptable that the Pentagon waited multiple days to notify the President of the United States, the National Security Council, and the American people that Defense Secretary Austin was hospitalized and unable to perform his duties. I represent Fort Drum - home of the most deployed division in the U.S. Army since 9/11. There are currently thousands of 10th Mountain Division Soldiers deployed in the Middle East. And while those brave Servicemembers were under attack by Iranian-backed terrorists, the Secretary of Defense was in the ICU. The Deputy Secretary of Defense was on vacation, and Joe Biden and the White House were completely unaware. In the chain of command, the Secretary of Defense serves as the connection through which the President commands and controls our armed forces. There will be a Congressional investigation, already launched by HASC Chairman Mike Rogers, into this dangerous dereliction of duty, and there must be full accountability beginning, I believe, with the immediate resignation of Secretary Austin and anyone who lied for him.

I now want to turn our attention to Joe Biden's border crisis which continues to be the number one concern, certainly of constituents in my district and one of the top concerns of Americans across the country. Last week, over 60 House Republicans went to Texas, led by the Speaker of the House, to see first hand the catastrophe that Joe Biden’s open border policies have created. And it's not just in Texas. In Upstate New York where my district shares a border with Canada, overworked border patrol agents are being overwhelmed there by a flux of illegal immigrants from 79 different countries, just recently, apprehending an Iranian national with clear terrorist ties. Since Joe Biden stepped into the Oval Office, there have been over eight million illegal crossings. Last month, more than 300,000 illegal immigrants poured into our country setting the record for the most monthly encounters in history. As President Ronald Reagan historically said, “A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” Every day that Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas refuse to secure our borders they fail the American people, sacrificing our nation’s safety, security, and sovereignty. And while Joe Biden and Democrats refuse to act, House Republicans have taken action, passing the strongest border security bill in American history, H.R.2, the Secure the Border Act, and we voted for significant year-over-year funding increases for our courageous Border Patrol and ICE agents.

As we speak, House Republicans on the Homeland Committee are beginning the impeachment process of Secretary Mayorkas for refusing to do his job and refusing to uphold the law.”

Title: Stefanik, Wild Introduce Consistent Egg Labels Act
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congresswoman Susan Wild (D-PA) introduced the bipartisanConsistent Egg Labels Actto protect egg producers and the quality of their products by combatting the unfair practice of mislabeled imitation egg products using the term “egg” on their product labels. Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.

“I’m leading the effort to help egg producers in Upstate New York and the North Country protect the quality and reputation of their products by ending deceptive marketing practices by imitation egg products. Misbranded egg alternatives do not deliver the same nutritional value, yet profit off of deceiving consumers with the use of terms such as “egg” in their marketing. This mislabeling is not only confusing for American consumers, but it is false advertising,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“I’ve heard from poultry farmers in my community about the importance of protecting Pennsylvania’s farm industry from so-called ‘egg alternatives,’”said Congresswoman Susan Wild.“That’s why I’m proud to co-lead the bipartisan Consistent Egg Labels Act of 2024, which will not only help our poultry farmers but also provide more transparency to consumers.”

“United Egg Producers is grateful for the bipartisan leadership supporting the Consistent Egg Labels Act. Eggs remain one of nature’s most perfect foods, and imitation products cannot compete with the unmatched protein and nutrients found in eggs. Our farmer-members, who produce the vast majority of the nation’s eggs, recognize the need for clarity on labels for consumers, and the Consistent Egg Labels Act provides that transparency,”stated United Egg Producers.

“As a family farmer and third generation egg producer in New York, I appreciate the advocacy of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik on behalf of America’s egg farmers,”said Craig Giroux, Giroux’s Poultry Farm.“Quite simply, an egg is an egg, and no imitation product can deliver the high-quality protein and tremendous nutritional value of eggs. Congresswoman Stefanik is a champion for our state’s farm community, and her leadership to protect the authenticity and value of eggs by requiring proper labeling on egg imitations is critical for our industry’s future.”

Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on Kathy Hochul’s State of the State.

“Corrupt Kathy Hochul and Albany Democrats have left the State of New York in complete and total disarray. Under her administration, New York State is seeing a mass exodus of residents who can no longer afford to call the Empire State their home. This past year, our state has endured record crime while seeing the indefensible decriminalization of crimes by Albany Democrats. New Yorkers have watched illegal immigrants be prioritized over American citizens, and their communities become unsafe overnight. While New Yorkers struggle to afford groceries due to Bidenflation, Kathy Hochul doubles down on their pain by committing to spending taxpayer dollars on ridiculous priorities like pools. Kathy Hochul's attack on our Second Amendment drove the country’s oldest gun manufacturer out of our state, and her anti-business policies threaten to cost millions of New Yorkers their jobs. Corrupt Albany Democrats should be ashamed of the destruction of our state under their failed leadership. Thankfully, the New York Republican delegation in Congress is hard at work in congress, on behalf of hardworking New Yorkers and we will continue to do all we can to push back against the failed policies of Albany Democrats."

Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. - Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement following the Biden Administration's announcement of an unclear, overly restrictive rule for determining worker classification that will have devastating impacts on independent workers and our economy.

“Once again, Joe Biden and his Administration are trying to circumvent Congress, the People’s representatives, to enact disastrous, overreaching labor policy that strips workers and entrepreneurs across America of their right to be their own boss and work with the flexibility they desire as an independent contractor,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I reintroduced the Modern Worker Empowerment Act to protect American workers' flexibility in their pursuit of their own American Dream. I will always work to protect the freedom for Americans to earn a living and provide for their families the best way they see fit.”

In September 2023, Congresswoman Elise StefanikreintroducedtheModern Worker Empowerment Actto update theFair Labor Standards Actand theNational Labor Relations Actto create a clear definition and standard across federal laws to protect independent workers. With multitudes of differing state and federal statutes regulating independent contractors, theModern Worker Empowerment Actwill provide much needed clarity and stability for the American independent worker ensuring opportunities regardless of which state they reside.

Congresswoman Stefanikslammedthe Biden Department of Labor’s proposed rule on worker classification under theFair Labor Standards Actthat would significantly restrict opportunities for individuals to work as independent contractors.

At this dangerous time when American service members are under attack in Iraq and Syria, our closest partner and ally Israel is at war with Hamas terrorists, and the threat from Communist China is on the rise, it is critical that the Secretary of Defense has the full trust of the American people, Congress, and the White House. This concerning lack of transparency exemplifies a shocking lack of judgment and a significant national security threat. There must be full accountability beginning with the immediate resignation of Secretary Austin and those that lied for him and a Congressional investigation into this dangerous dereliction of duty.”

Washington, D.C. –Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joinedThe Roger Stone Showto discuss the long overdue resignation of Former Harvard President Claudine Gay, the ongoing investigation into America’s fundamentally broken and corrupt higher education system, Joe Biden’s weaponization of the federal government, the House’s impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, and much more.

Listen to her full interview here.

Find the full transcript of her interview below.

On Exposing the Rot Of Antisemitism Within Our Nation’s Colleges and Universities:

“Well, thank you for asking, Roger. That hearing made history. The question that I posed the three university presidents was a very specific moral question. It was not a political question. And the question was, ‘Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct on bullying and harassment?’ And the reason I asked that question in that way was I anticipated that each of the university presidents would, of course, answer ‘Yes’. And instead, they all blew it in a historic fashion. And as I said, in my question, and response to them in real time, ‘The world is watching.’And indeed, there were over one billion views in less than a week making it the most viewed congressional testimony in history. Let me take you a little bit further into the room and the purpose of that hearing. So, I am a graduate of Harvard. I was the first member of my immediate family to have the opportunity to graduate from college. And I was very proud and I'm still proud to have broken those barriers for my family. And it has been unbelievable to hear the harrowing stories from students, from Jewish faculty members, Jewish students on campus who have faced physical assault, harassment, and particularly after the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th by Hamas, the universities’ absolute failure to stand strongly to protect Jewish students and stand by our greatest ally, Israel. So I encouraged the Committee to host that hearing. I did not anticipate that there would be such horrific answers. And we've now seen the results. Two of those university presidents have been forced to resign. Penn’s President, Liz McGill, was forced to resign within a week. And it took about a month for Harvard's President. They tried to hang on. They tried to cover up her morally bankrupt testimony. They tried to cover up after much scrutiny over 50 examples of egregious plagiarism in her academic and professional portfolio. But ultimately, she was forced to resign as well. And it is just the tip of the iceberg, Roger, I mean, these are university presidents sitting atop institutions where antisemitism is on the rise, unfortunately, on college campuses, and it is ingrained in these DEI woke policies that we have seen really capture our higher ed institutions. So there's a lot more work going forward.”

On Former Harvard President Claudine Gay’s Long Overdue Resignation & Ongoing Congressional Investigations:

“Well, I think the hearing had an immediate impact. For example, Stanford and University of Michigan i. a day, I believe, after the hearing, they made a public statement that calling for the genocide of Jews would in fact, violate their schools’ code of conduct. And I think it is going to really unveil much more work that needs to happen. And that's why this investigation is so important, looking at the governance structure of these universities. So in the case of Harvard, you have the Harvard Corporation Board that covered up the plagiarism scandal that they were aware of prior to the Congressional hearing. They also covered up and unanimously supported her despite her morally bankrupt testimony. You also have the federal funding piece. So each of these universities relies on billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars. And we need to take a closer look at that on behalf of the American people. There's also a foreign funding piece. And that was a question that I asked Harvard specifically in the hearing that didn't get quite as much coverage. But it's still very, very important is, these schools are accepting foreign funding with strings attached to it, whether it's the curricula that they teach, whether it's the professors that they hire, and this is part of the strain of antisemitism. If you look at the Qatar money that is flowing into the Middle Eastern Studies programs at many universities, specifically Harvard is one of those. And then as I mentioned, Roger, the DEI offices, which are themselves inherently racist, we need to make sure that we bring transparency and accountability and that there's no taxpayer dollars going to prop up these DEI offices. And I'll give you an example at Harvard. Even prior to Hamas’ terrorist attack against Israel. A few years ago, hundreds of students had reached out to the Office of DEI, concerned about the rise of antisemitic slurs, antisemitic attacks, and harassment on campus. The Office of DEI at Harvard did not even respond. That is unacceptable. So there's a lot of work to do, but people are looking for leadership. And as you said, Claudine Gay and Harvard’s statement claimed racism, claimed that it was a well laid trap. It was not a trap. It was a very simple question.”

On Joe Biden’s Weaponization Of The Federal Government:

“Well, Roger, we are seeing the greatest attack on our democracy, and that is the weaponization of the federal government to go after Joe Biden’s top political opponent, and frankly, this goes back to 2016 where you had a corrupt FBI targeting the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, in the 2016 election cycle. You had the Obama Administration perpetrate the false Russia hoax that of course led to the sham impeachment, which I was a part of front and center on Adam Schiff’s absolutely partisan impeachment sham, and I was proud to be the leading voice standing up against Adam Schiff. So this is all part of a timeline of weaponizing the federal government.”

On The Biden Impeachment Inquiry:

“I’ve been the biggest advocate for the importance of moving that along because I believe the American people deserve transparency. I have always said that I believe this will be the greatest political scandal of our lifetime and potentially in American history. You have in the White House currently, the head of the Biden Crime Family, ie: the “Big Guy.” Ten percent for the big guy. The American people are smart, they know that’s Joe Biden. We literally have uncovered under the leadership of Jamie Comer, who chairs Oversight, Jason Smith who chairs Ways and Means, and Jim Jordan who chairs Judiciary, we have uncovered bank records of hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing from Hunter Biden’s corrupt illegal businesses with foreign adversaries like Communist China flowing right into Joe Biden’s bank account. This is a compromised President. He is unfit for office and I believe it is very important that all of those facts be made clear to the American people. Right before the district work period over the holidays, we saw Hunter Biden defy a subpoena and show up to the halls of Congress after coordinating with Joe Biden. That makes Joe Biden complicit in the defiance of the subpoena. So we need to hold these individuals accountable, and I believe transparency is an important part of that process which is why we are going to continue moving the investigation forward quickly but thoroughly which is really important and the American people can make their decision come November. And I believe that Joe Biden, as I said, this will be the greatest political scandal of certainly my lifetime and potentially in U.S. history.”

On Hunter Biden Defying A Congressional Subpoena:

“Well, of course, yes. Again, you cannot pick and choose when to respond to a congressional subpoena, a legal congressional subpoena, and Hunter Biden defied that importantly though, Roger, by coordinating with Joe Biden, the sitting President of the United States. So, yes, that is. I support contempt of Congress and I believe we will move that. I am urging that to be moved and working with my colleagues to do so. But we are going to see, I anticipate, a continuation of how political and radical the Department of Justice has become because you and I both know that they are not going to pursue that against Hunter Biden and part of, I believe, this scandal is the Department of Justice’s cover-up of Hunter Biden. Whether it’s the whistleblowers from the IRS that have come forward or whether it’s, you know, thank goodness for that judge who did not approve of that sweetheart deal that was negotiated for Hunter Biden to try to clean things up in the off year before 2024. So there is a lot more layers here that we need to peel to make sure that the American people know all the facts about how absolutely corrupt Joe Biden and his family are.”

On Sending More Aid to Ukraine:

“We have significant challenges in our own country, and I will tell you, our top priority is securing the Southern border. It is Joe Biden who has refused to secure the Southern Border. And it's not just funding for the Southern Border, it's specific policy changes. We passed our border security bill. That's what I want to see as the starting point for any discussion when it comes to January and February legislative packages, and that's where the American people are. The vast majority of the American people are very concerned about our wide open Southern and Northern Border. We've seen it's a national security crisis as we've seen people on the terrorist watchlist pour over our Southern Border and Northern Border. So that's what I'm focused on. And, you know, our Republicans are divided. I do not think that we have seen from this Administration or from Ukraine what their strategic plan is in terms of utilizing and ensuring the integrity of the U.S. dollar. So I have significant concerns. My focus is on securing our Southern and Northern Borders in the U.S. and our domestic issues.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins NBC’s Meet the Press to Discuss Joe Biden’s Failed Leadership, the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Former Harvard President Claudine Gay’s Resignation, and More
Date: 2024

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined NBC’s Kristen Welker onMeet the Pressto discuss Joe Biden’s weaponization of the federal government against conservatives, the long overdue resignation of Former Harvard President Claudine Gay, House Republican’s investigation into the growing antisemitism on college campuses, her legislative priorities in 2024, and much more.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On Joe Biden and Democrats’ Failed Leadership:

“Well, first, Kristen, I wouldn't say it's a winning argument. In fact, in 2022, Democrats lost the House, and House Republicans ran on the issues that matter to the American people. We ran on securing the border. We ran on addressing the historic inflation which the American people know is a result of Joe Biden's failed policies and the trillions of dollars of reckless spending. And what Joe Biden didn't mention in his speech were any of the policies that have created a crisis across America. So zero mention of the border, which is wide open and a top issue even in my home state of New York. You have Democrat mayors who are speaking out about Joe Biden's border crisis. No mention of inflation which continues to be a concern for voters across my district, and when it comes to threats to democracy, Joe Biden and Democrats are a threat to democracy. We see them attempting to remove President Trump from the ballot. We saw this in Colorado and Maine. That is a suppression of the American people and the American people's ability to cast their ballots this November, so it's Democrats that are a threat to democracy.”

On Delivering Transparency and Accountability to the American People:

“Well, first of all, Kristen, as typical for NBC in the biased media, you played one excerpt of my speech. I stand by my comments that I made on the House Floor. I stood up for election integrity, and I challenged and objected to the certification of the state of Pennsylvania because of the unconstitutional overreach. So I absolutely stand by my floor speech. I am proud to support President Trump, and I want to correct another statement you made that there is no coordination with Joe Biden and the Department of Justice and prosecutions against President Trump. We just saw Hunter Biden defy a congressional subpoena. And the White House admitting it was in coordination with Joe Biden the morning of. That is coordination, and I believe that Joe Biden will be found to be the most corrupt president in our nation's history. And that's why all of the investigative work that we're doing is so, so important because the American people, they deserve transparency and accountability.”

On the Weaponization of the Federal Government:

“I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. I have concerns. We have a role in Congress of oversight over our treatment of prisoners and I believe that we're seeing the weaponization of the federal government against, not just President Trump, but we're seeing it against conservatives. We're seeing it against Catholics, and that's one of the reasons why I'm so proud to serve on the Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Government because the American people want answers. They want transparency. And they understand that as you look across this country, there seems to be two sets of rules: if your last name is Clinton or it's Biden, you get to live by a different set of rules than if you're an everyday, patriotic American. I've been clear, Kristen. If you go back and play the full speech I gave on the House Floor, I condemned the violence just like I condemned the violence of the BLM riots, but I also importantly stood for election integrity and security of our elections which if we don't have that, we do not have a democracy. So the real threat to our democracy is these baseless, witch hunt investigations and lawsuits against President Trump, whether it's Tish James or whether we see in the DC Circuit Court, and that is undemocratic, and it's shredding our Constitution. And you know who agrees with me, Kristen? The American people. That's why President Trump is winning in poll after poll against Joe Biden.”

On Hunter Biden Receiving A Sweetheart Plea Deal:

“If you want to make that case–the American people are very smart–they know that they tried to give Hunter Biden a sweetheart deal. We've heard from multiple IRS whistleblowers.”

…

“It was because of a judge that threw out a sweetheart deal that was negotiated on Joe Biden's behalf. Joe Biden and the Department of Justice have been withheld from going after the Biden Crime Family which Joe Biden sits atop of.”

On Having Legal and Valid Elections:

“Well, I voted not to certify the state of Pennsylvania because as we saw in Pennsylvania and other states across the country, that there was unconstitutional acts circumventing the state legislature and unilaterally changing election law.”

…

“We will see if this is a legal and valid election. What we're seeing so far is that Democrats are so desperate, they're trying to remove President Trump from the ballot. That is a suppression of the American people, and the Supreme Court is taking that case up in February. That should be a nine to zero to allow President Trump to appear on the ballot because that's the American people's decision to make this November.”

…

“If they’re Constitutional. No, it means, if they are Constitutional. What we saw in 2020 was unconstitutional circumventing of the Constitution, not going through state legislatures when it comes to changing election law. And we're seeing this in my home state of New York, Kristen. We are seeing Democrats try to steal the election and illegally gerrymander congressional districts that we fairly won and are fair line. So I see this at a very local level as well as the unconstitutional overreach we saw at the national level in 2020.”

…

“Well, let me make a final point. And I think it's important because the American people understand that it was not a fair election. We had unconstitutional overreach, and that was why I objected to certain states when it came to my constitutional responsibility as a member of Congress. I’m going to always stand up for the Constitution and make sure that we have strong election integrity. And the real threat to democracy is Joe Biden and Democrats who are attempting to remove President Trump from the ballot because Joe Biden knows he can't win at the ballot box.”

On Former Harvard President Claudine Gay’s Long Overdue Resignation:

“It was long overdue. She should have resigned immediately following the hearing, and of course, this follows the resignation of Liz McGill, the Penn president who also answered almost verbatim the same way that the Harvard Former President did, as well. And so did the MIT President, I might add. I called for all three of their resignations. It's not just me who called for the resignations. We passed a vote, bipartisan, who called for the resignation on the floor of Congress. But I want to take you a little bit into that hearing, Kristen. That was the last question of the hearing, and I tried to structure the question in a way that was a moral question and not political. And it was a moral question, and I was expecting them to answer,  ‘Yes.’ And I was astonished in real time that they said, ‘It depends on the context.’ You put up three of my constituents: a farmer, a manufacturer, and a suburban mom, they know how to answer the question correctly. It was the most morally bankrupt testimony I've heard ever in Congress, and that's why it's the most viewed testimony ever.”

On Claudine Gay’s Refusal To Take Accountability For Her Actions:

“Well, I would respond that she failed to stand up for Jewish students on campus who have been facing antisemitic attacks, who have been facing physical assaults. We've seen that footage. We've heard that directly from students on campus. We've also heard faculty concerns about her tenure, and her position, and her lack of academic integrity, but it really goes back to protecting Jewish students. And frankly, when it comes to Harvard, the only time that Harvard has pled for academic freedom or freedom of speech was when it comes to the genocide of the Jewish people. That is inherently unfit for a person to be president of the university. It is part of a broader issue at these schools which is why our investigation is so important. We're going to look at DEI which inherently has refused to bring up concerns from Jewish students of the rise of antisemitic attacks. We're going to look at foreign funding as well as taxpayer funding and the governance of these universities. You saw that these boards doubled down to support these university professors despite the morally bankrupt testimony.”

On Standing With President Trump:

“Well yet again, we have the media which is so biased, which is reiterating whatever the talking points the Biden campaign is giving.”

…

“Our border crisis is poisoning Americans through fentanyl. It is poisoning people including in my district, who are dying from overdoses of fentanyl, and you know why? Because of Joe Biden's wide open border, the executive actions he took on day one. So yes, I stand by President Trump. And President Trump also has, he has the strongest record when it comes to supporting the Jewish people and supporting the State of Israel. Whether you look at the historic Abraham Accords or whether you look at the ability for Jewish students to sue and stand up for equal treatment at schools under the Title VI Executive Order that President Trump put in place, not Joe Biden.”

…

“These university presidents answered the question: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university's code of conduct?” They said, “It depends on the context,” and even in the case of the Penn president, they said it would have to take a step towards conduct. That testimony speaks for itself. It was morally bankrupt. It was viewed by over one billion people in less than a week. And when you are the president of these universities, you need to show moral leadership as well as academic leadership, and they have absolutely failed. And what was interesting, Kristen, they did not even realize in the moment. What you can’t see in that hearing in the video, is there were Jewish students from each of those schools. And from our vantage point, where I was seated, they were physically shaken by those answers. So they're unfit to be those presidents and these schools need to do a lot of soul searching to make sure that they have morally fit leaders as university presidents which is why our investigation is important.”

On House Republicans Strong Record Condemning Antisemitism:

“Absolutely, House Republicans stand strongly when it comes to condemning antisemitism. And let's be clear, Kristen, over 100 Democrats in the House voted against condemning antisemitism, whereas it got universal support among House Republicans. When we put the resolution on the floor calling for the resignation, House Republicans voted in support of that and so did a fair number of Democrats. But there were a number of Democrats who did not vote in support of it. The rise in antisemitism is an issue on the Left. And you know, who hasn't spoken out loudly and clearly calling for the resignation of those presidents was Joe Biden.”

…

“But Joe Biden did not. It did not come from Joe Biden. I credit Doug Emhoff, the Second Gentleman, for speaking out and the press secretary did, but the President of the United States did not, and he was a teacher at Penn, and he could have spoken out and he should have spoken out.”

On Biden’s Responsibility To Secure The Border And Avoid A Government Shutdown:

“Well, let's take a step back, Kristen. It is Joe Biden who would rather shut down the government than secure the border. Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer in the Senate, have failed to take up our Secure the Border Act which we passed. It has strong policies returning to the very effective border security policies of President Trump, including construction of a border wall, ending catch-and-release, returning to “Remain in Mexico.” And the Senate negotiations are ongoing. We will see what they produce, but it needs to be real border security policies that we know work which did under the Trump Administration. Joe Biden has failed to take that up and so has the Senate.”

…

“We don't support shutting down the government, but we must secure the border. We must secure the border. That's where the American people are. We're losing our country in front of our very eyes. And again, I take it to my home state in New York. Every state across the country is a border state. So the person who's threatening a government shutdown is Joe Biden who refuses to secure the border. And again, you have Democrats like in New York City speaking out about this Biden border crisis.”

New York Sun:Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: Claudine Gay’s Departure From Presidency of Harvard Is ‘the Tip of the Iceberg’

By M.J. Koch

The departure of Claudine Gay from her post as Harvard’s president marks “the tip of the iceberg” of a wider scandal rocking the university, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik tells the Sun, and the beginning of a series of tectonic changes soon to hit the nation’s oldest university.

Harvard’s provost and chief academic officer, Alan Garber, will serve as interim president until a new leader is appointed. Ms. Stefanik, a Republican representative of New York who grilled Ms. Gay during her Capitol Hill testimony last month, says that much of the damage to Harvard’s reputation has already been done. She is urging members of the university’s board to follow in Ms. Gay’s footsteps and step down.

“This is the beginning of what I believe will be the greatest scandal of any college or university ever, and our congressional investigation is going to continue apace,” Ms. Stefanik, a Harvard alumnus who heads the House Republican Conference, tells the Sun on Tuesday.

Ms. Stefanik says the House Education and the Workforce Committee’s probe into Harvard will “uncover the absolute negligence and failures of the Harvard Corporation,” the university’s highest governing body. “It’s going to expose an institutional rot of antisemitism in Harvard as an institution, its failure to protect Jewish students, and its shirking of academic integrity.”

Ms. Gay’s resignation as Harvard’s 30th president marks the shortest tenure in the university’s history. The reason that its board members should now step down as well, Ms. Stefanik says, is that they “covered up her long history of plagiarism. Instead of ensuring that the president was held to the highest academic standard, they threatened to sue media outlets.”

Nearly 50 allegations of plagiarism have been leveled at Ms. Gay. Yet even as the plagiarism issue was coming to a boil, the boardvotedunanimously to keep Ms. Gay in her post, asserting that she was “the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very serious societal issues we are facing.”

The change in the board’s attitude comes after a 17 percent drop in early applications to the university in 2023 compared to the prior year.

“Harvard did irreparable damage to its former position as the most prestigious higher education institution in the world,” Ms. Stefanik says. “That’s not going to be rebuilt overnight.” She lauds President Larry Summers, who served at Harvard’s helm while she was a student there in 2006, as “an excellent university president.” She called it “so disgraceful how far Harvard has fallen.”

Mr. Summers, a former treasury secretary, has been anoutspokencritic of the university’s response to rising antisemitism in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attacks, but he has become mostly silent since Ms. Gay’s damning congressional testimony in early December. Ms. Stefaniktold the Sunlast month that the testimony would lead to “an earthquake in higher education.”

The tremors of that earthquake hit today. “After consultation with members of the Corporation,” Ms. Gay wrote in an email to members of the Harvard community shortly after the Boston Globe broke the news Tuesday, “it has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.”

Ms. Gay suggested that “racial animus” played a part in her ouster, adding in her statement that “it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor — two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am.” To resign as president, she said, gives her “a heavy heart.”

The Harvard Corporation, meanwhile, put out its own statement saying that “while President Gay has acknowledged missteps and has taken responsibility for them, it is also true that she has shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks.” The search for the next president, the corporation said, will involve “broad engagement and consultation with the Harvard community.”

Minutes after the news made headlines, some students spoke out in support of the embattled president. “She deserved better,” a Harvard student wrote on a social media platform that offers anonymity, Sidechat. Other students, though, responded with statements such as: “so did the people she plagiarized,” “so did the Jews on campus,” and “we deserve better.”

“Two down, one to go,”  Ms. Stefanik says of the three university heads who testified before Congress in early December. The president of the University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill, resigned just days after the hearing. It took weeks for the pressure to mount against Ms. Gay to the point where her presidency, as Ms. Stefanik puts it, became “untenable.” She is now urging the president of MIT to step down as well.

New York Post:Harvard President Claudine Gay’s resignation the beginning of reckoning’ amid House antisemitism probe: Stefanik

By Josh Christenson

Harvard University President Claudine Gay’s resignationover plagiarism will be “just the beginning of the reckoning,” House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik told The Post Tuesday — vowing that Republicans will carry out a “long overdue” cleansing of higher education’s “institutional rot.”

“The Harvard Corporation should have forced this resignation immediately after thecongressional hearing just a month ago, but they failed and it became clear … that her presidency was untenable,” said Stefanik, a 2006 graduate of Harvard College.

Stefanik (R-NY) added that the Harvard president, whoannounced in a statementthat she was resigning from her leadership post, but would remain on the Ivy League school’s faculty, had been a “disgrace” during her short tenure, “whether it was her failure to protect Jewish students or the just shredding of academic integrity in the university’s attempt to cover up her nearly 50 instances of plagiarism.”

“I’m a graduate of Harvard; it was previously the most prestigious higher education institution in the world. That is long gone,” Stefanik went on.

Last month, Republicans on the House Education and Workforce Committeelaunched aninvestigation of Harvard and other elite universitiesover their handling of recent antisemitic incidents on campus following disastrous testimony by Gay, then-Penn President Liz Magill and MIT President Sally Kornbluth.

Stefanik said that effort would “continue apace.”

“Billions of taxpayer dollars go to these institutions,” she said. “And not only do you have Jewish students who are being physically assaulted and harassed on campus, but you have a lot in these offices of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] that are antisemitic by definition.

“And I believe the investigation is going to uncover what will be the greatest scandal in colleges and university history.”

The antisemitism probe, and another investigation into what Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) has called “credible allegations of plagiarism” against Gay, have already begun with requests for internal documents and threats of subpoena if universities do not comply.

Stefanik pointed out that “hundreds of Jewish students” had reached out to Harvard’s DEI office about “the rise of antisemitic slurs” and “antisemitic acts on campus” but had received no response.

“I am working with Chairwoman Virginia Foxx. We are absolutely focused on document requests, and we will not hesitate to use subpoenas,” she said.

“They don’t get to live by a different set of rules because they happen to be on the board of Harvard. They have to respond to the United States Congress by law — and especially because billions of US taxpayer dollars go to fund these institutions.”

“This is just the beginning of the reckoning. This is long overdue,” she added.

Stefanik made headlines Dec. 5 when she grilled Gay, Magill and Kornbluth during a House Education and Workforce Committee hearing about incidents of antisemitic harassment on their campuses. In an exchange that has since been viewed millions of times, Stefanik asked each whether anti-Israel students calling for the genocide of Jews in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7 violated their universities’ codes of conduct related to bullying and harassment.

Gay and the others declined to give a yes-or-no answer to the question, emphasizing that the speech would depend on “context” and would only warrant action if rising to the level of bullying, harassment and intimidation.

Magill resigned Dec. 9, four days after the disastrous testimony, but Gay survived the initial blowback. However, her tenure as Harvard’s president could not survive a second scandal — this time concerning her lifting citations from other scholars without attribution on her academic work dating back to her doctoral dissertation.

“As I said, after the Penn president resigned, ‘One down, two to go.’ Now we’re at, ‘Two down, one to go,’” Stefanik said. “They’ve lost their moral clarity with now infamously delivering the most morally bankrupt testimony in the history of Congress.”

That “moral bankruptcy,” she charged, went right to the top at Harvard, where the university’s governing body chose to retain Gay — reportedly under pressure to do so from high-profile figures likeformer President Barack Obama, a 1991 Harvard Law graduate.

“Not only did they allow it to fester, they covered it up. And it’s a fiduciary responsibility when you serve on these governance boards of these institutions,” Stefanik said.

“And in the case of Harvard, we now know that the Harvard Corporation was aware of the credible accusations of plagiarism and instead of addressing that, they threatened to sue a media outlet,” she said, referencingthreats The Post received from attorneyshired by the university after comment was requested about allegations that Gay had stolen other academics’ work.

“What’s also of concern is the executive search for the Harvard president was the shortest ever when they selected Claudine Gay. And the individual who led that was Penny Pritzker, a former Obama Cabinet official,” Stefanik continued. “We also know that Obama himself called in to pressure the Harvard Corporation to keep Claudine Gay.

“The radical leftists on these boards made this political, and what they did was, they completely destroyed their academic integrity and they completely destroyed their moral leadership and their brand name worldwide.”

East Greenbush, N.Y.—Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox News’America Reportsto discuss the long overdue resignation of Harvard President Claudine Gay.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below:

On Claudine Gay’s Congressional Testimony:

“I say, John, that all three university presidents gave morally bankrupt testimony at the now infamous congressional hearing to a very specific moral question: Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s code of conduct? And one after the other, whether it was MIT, Penn, or Harvard, failed to answer that correctly, instead, bringing up, ‘It depends on the context.’ As you played earlier, it does not depend on the context. And as a Harvard graduate myself, we have seen a failure of leadership from Claudine Gay, a failure of moral leadership, but also, a failure of academic integrity which is a cornerstone of any higher education institution. So I called for her resignation, as I did for all three because of their abject failure in that congressional testimony and their failure to protect Jewish students. This is long overdue. It should not have taken the Harvard Corporation Board this long to demand her resignation. And I believe, as we continue our congressional investigation, that we will uncover, what will be the greatest scandal in higher education because the Harvard Corporation members themselves are complicit in this cover-up of her plagiarism and again, most importantly, their failure to protect Jewish students on campus.”

On Harvard’s Attempts to Cover-up Allegation of Claudine Gay’s Plagiarism:

“You know, this accountability would not have happened were it not for that congressional hearing, and I think what it forced was greater scrutiny of her position as the President of Harvard. And you have to remember, Gillian, she was selected as President of Harvard in a shorter search, you know executive search, than any other previous president, and they should have found out that there were fifty credible allegations of plagiarism. And the fact that the Harvard Corporation we now know knew about that before the congressional hearing and tried to cover it up and threaten media outlets to sue them, is a disgrace. When you are a board of any university, you need to make sure that your president, your faculty, and your students uphold the rigors of academic integrity, and instead, they wanted to hide this from their students, from their communities. So this accountability would not have happened were it not for the very clear, moral questions at the hearing, but there were many people who spoke out and really it was the over one billion views because of the pathetic testimony that led to this day.”

On Harvard Corporation’s Failure to Fire Claudine Gay:

“I don’t have information. I think it became clear, I said it has long been clear, everyone knows it. Harvard actually knew it deep down that her presidency was untenable. But I have been concerned that they tried to make this a political issue. It’s not political. It’s about academic integrity and moral leadership. And I’m a Harvard graduate myself. I know that the motto of Harvard is “veritas”, truth, and the Harvard Corporation absolutely failed in their responsibility to oversee this institution. They should have dealt with this immediately after the congressional hearing like Penn did.”

On the Ongoing Congressional Investigations Into Institutions of Higher Education:

This congressional investigation is not going to stop because of the resignation of these university presidents. There are deep institutional rots in these formally prestigious universities, whether it's their DEI offices, or whether it’s the antisemitism that we see raging on college campuses. So, I think the investigation is going to uncover much, much more. This is just, you know, about the university president on top of the institutions, but it’s an institutional rot that we are addressing because these colleges get billions of taxpayer dollars.”

On Claudine Gay Remaining A Harvard Faculty Member:

“No, and look at some of the student reporting in The Harvard Crimson. Students at Harvard are held to a standard that you can’t plagiarize, obviously. That does not stand for academic rigor and academic integrity. You can’t have members of the faculty, where a great percentage of their body of work is plagiarized. There are over fifty credible accusations, and she doesn’t have a very robust body of work as it is, compared to previous university presidents or faculty members. So, no she should not stay on the faculty.”

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below:

On Harvard President Claudine Gay’s Refusal to Condemn Antisemitism During Testimony:

“My take, Sean, is there is a reason that the testimony of the presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT made history as the most viewed testimony ever, with over one billion views and that’s because their testimony was morally bankrupt and pathetic. My question was very simple. It was a moral question: ‘does calling for the genocide of Jews ruin your school’s code of conduct, does it go against your school’s code of conduct?’ And every single one said ‘it depended upon the context.’ We know it does not depend on the context. It should be condemned. It is not that difficult to say that, yet all three failed abysmally, and the world saw it. It is unacceptable that it took Harvard a month to demand the resignation of Claudine Gay. Penn made the right decision immediately but this is after it was forced in front of the world to see. And I believe these university presidents sit atop these institutions that have rotted out and have institutionalized antisemitism, particularly after Hamas’s terrorist attack against Israel in early October. We’ve seen Jewish students assaulted, physically harassed, and facing just vile, vile attacks every single day.”

On University Presidents’ Double Standards When It Comes to Antisemitic Attacks:

“They would not have, Sean, and that’s why it was so pathetic, and it was so clear for everyone who saw that how wrong that testimony was. And I will tell you, what you can’t see in the video, that has now been viewed over one billion times, is there were Jewish students from each of those universities who were at that congressional hearing. And as I was listening to their responses to my question, the university presidents, Jewish students, you can see them shaking just of the abysmal lack of moral leadership. And then, on top of this, you’ve seen just the shredding of academic integrity in Harvard’s case, where it was very clear with this intense scrutiny that Claudine Gay was a plagiarist president, that she had plagiarized nearly fifty excerpts in her work, which is a very limited body of academic work when compared to other Harvard University presidents. And I say this as a Harvard graduate. I graduated from there, from undergrad with honors, and I will tell you students, if you plagiarized you’re expelled.”

Despite these historic numbers, Extreme Democrats continue to turn a blind eye to our Border Crisis, sacrificing the safety and security of Upstate New York and North Country as well as American communities nationwide.

Title: Stefanik, Panetta, Ernst, Gallagher Demand Oversight of U.S. Components in Communist Chinese Drones
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.—Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Chairman of the Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher (R-WI) sent aletterto Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin demanding oversight into the DoD’s role in allowing U.S. companies to export critical components to Communist Chinese drone manufacturer DJI.

“As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will hold the Biden Administration accountable for their failure to stop U.S. technology from being exported to DJI, a Communist Chinese drone company,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“DJI supplies our adversaries around the world including Iranian-backed Hamas and Russia with drones to carry out vicious attacks against our allies. These export licenses should not have been approved and American technology should not be advancing DJI drones. It is time to end Communist China’s weaponization of American ingenuity.”

"As conflicts around the world expand, Congress must ensure that American technology does not fall into the hands of untrustworthy companies, like Da Jiang Innovations, to be used against our allies,”said Congressman Panetta.“It is our responsibility, as Members of Congress, to provide proper oversight over the transfer of this technology and if need be, take corrective action.  We cannot allow American innovation and ingenuity to be used to undermine, threaten, or attack the United States or our allies.”

“As we work to keep China out of our skies, we must prevent U.S. parts from equipping CCP spyware,”Senator Ernst said.“The Chinese Communist Party will stop at nothing to infiltrate our sovereign nation, and American-made technology should not be allowed to enhance the capabilities of our adversaries to undermine our own national security, commit brutal humanitarian oppression, or assist Iran-backed Hamas or Russia. Action must be taken to counter the full risk Chinese-controlled drones pose to U.S. security interests.”

“From facilitating terrorist attacks in the Middle East to intelligence threats to the American homeland, drones made by the Chinese-owned company DJI pose an unacceptable risk to our national security,”said Chairman Gallagher.“Despite these clear threats, which landed DJI drones on multiple government blacklists, DJI has leveraged bureaucratic get-out-of-jail-free cards to rip off American technology while undermining our national security. This needs to stop.”

In 2020, DJI was placed on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List for its facilitation of widespread human rights abuses in Communist China. The Entity List is intended to prohibit American companies from exporting technology that will enable U.S. adversaries to advance their ability to undermine U.S. national security. However, America’s adversaries are using DJI drones that contain American cutting-edge technology to harm U.S. national security interests and the security of U.S. partners.

The letter also requests that DoD’s aviation, electronics, and unmanned aerial vehicle technical experts and engineers who reviewed these transfer requests to DJI meet with Members of Congress or their staff to explain their national security review processes and their final recommendations.

The lawmakers were joined by Reps. Wittman (R-VA), Guest (R-MS), Issa (R-CA), Yakym (R-IN), Gooden (R-TX), Moylan (R-Guam), Jackson (R-TX), Mills (R-FL), Rouzer (R-NC), and Senators Blackburn (R-TN), Rubio (R-FL), and Young (R-IN).

Title: Stefanik, D’Esposito Introduce Resolution Condemning Kathy Hochul’s Clean Slate Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY) led the NY GOP delegation in introducing a resolution condemning Governor Kathy Hochul’s Far LeftClean Slate Actwhich will automatically seal criminal records of eligiblemisdemeanors from public view after three years and certain felonies after eight years following the individual’s release or sentence, as long as they do not have additional subsequent charges.

“I am proud to join Congressman D’Esposito in condemning Kathy Hochul’s absurd Clean Slate Act which will incentivize criminals to continue terrorizing the streets of New York,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Once again Kathy Hochul is prioritizing violent criminals over victims and our men and women in Blue. Kathy Hochul’s disastrous, pro-crime Clean Slate Act will prohibit New Yorkers from conducting comprehensive background checks on potential employees or tenants, further endangering the lives of all our constituents.”

"I am proud to join Congresswoman Elise Stefanik in introducing legislation to condemn Governor Kathy Hochul's reckless embrace of the far left's pro-criminal agenda via her Clean Slate Act,"said Congressman Anthony D'Esposito. "While the public safety situation continues to deteriorate in many corners of the Empire State thanks to Albany progressives' failing soft-on-crime criminal justice policies, Governor Kathy Hochul is once again placing the priorities of criminals ahead of law-abiding New Yorkers and our community's law enforcement professionals. The Clean Slate Act will handcuff employers and landlords by preventing comprehensive background checks from being conducted on potential employees and tenants, thereby endangering everyday New Yorkers who may be unintentionally placing themselves in harm's way thanks to the Governor's misguided plan."

This resolution recognizes that New York City experienced a 22% increase in overall major crime compared to 2021 and that the New York Police Department is already facing budget cuts and hiring freezes making it even more difficult to combat crime. The resolution also highlights issues surrounding theClean Slate Act’spassage including its negative effect of prohibiting many New Yorkers from conducting comprehensive background checks on potential tenants and employees and its consequence of empowering criminals at the expense of New York law abiding citizens.

Representatives Stefanik and D’Esposito were joined by Reps. Tenney (R-NY), Malliotakis (R-NY), Williams (R-NY), Garbarino (R-NY), Molinaro (R-NY), Lawler (R-NY), LaLota (R-NY), and Langworthy (R-NY).

Title: Stefanik Leads Bipartisan Letter Demanding Accountability of Canada’s Obligations under USMCA
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.—Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, along with her colleagues Congressman Mike Bost (R-IL), Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA), Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach (R-MN), Congresswoman Annie Kuster (D-NH), and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (D-WA) led abipartisan letterto Secretary Thomas Vilsack and Ambassador Katherine Tai regarding the recent United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) dairy tariff rate quota (TRQ) dispute settlement ruling. The letter expresses extreme disappointment in the ruling and demands the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) outline the next steps they plan to take to ensure fair access to Canadian export markets for U.S. dairy products.

The letter states,“Canada’s unwillingness to provide fair market access harms U.S. dairy producers and processors and contradicts our understanding of what was negotiated and agreed to in good faith under the USMCA. Canada’s unfair trade practices were made clear in the United States’ first dairy dispute against Canada in 2021, which determined Canada was not living up to its obligations. The changes that Canada has since made to “comply” with the 2021 ruling have not resulted in increased export opportunities for U.S. dairy producers and processors.”

“I am proud to bring the concerns of Upstate New York and North Country dairy farmers who work tirelessly to produce nutritious milk products to the highest levels of the federal government,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Our dairy farmers deserve the market access they were promised under USMCA. I will continue to work to ensure that USMCA is enforced to allow fair market access for our dairy farmers, and continue to push USTR and USDA to hold Canada accountable to their obligations under USMCA.”

“I am deeply disappointed with the recent USMCA ruling on Canada’s dairy trade measures,”saidCongressman Mike Bost.“This will make it harder for our dairy products to enter the Canadian market and poses a significant threat to Illinois' economy, as the third-largest U.S. dairy exporter to Canada. I am proud to lead this charge in demanding accountability from Canada and transparency from the Biden Administration to protect our billion-dollar industry. Southern Illinois' 12thCongressional district is home to 25 percent of the state’s dairy cows, and we cannot afford to let this issue sit idly by at the expense of our dairy producers and processors. Fair market access is non-negotiable and it’s vital that Canada lives up to its end of the bargain."

“IDFA is deeply disappointed by the USMCA dispute panel’s failure to defend even the most basic rights outlined in the trade agreement. The future of U.S. dairy trade relies upon fair market access that is enabled by comprehensive, rules-based trade agreements with strong enforcement mechanisms. IDFA is grateful to the many congressional dairy champions working to improve market access with Canada, and we look forward to continuing to work with Congress, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to hold Canada accountable to its USMCA commitments,”saidMichael Dykes, D.V.M., president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.

“We thank Congresswoman Stefanik for leading this important message on the need for holding Canada accountable to their dairy market access obligations,”said Jim Mulhern, president and CEO of National Milk Producers Federation.“Despite the USMCA dispute panel ruling last month that enables Canada to continue restricting U.S. dairy exports, USMCA was designed to facilitate trade and to provide the expanded market access for U.S. dairy products outlined in the agreement. American dairy farmers cannot afford to lose further ground in a growing global competitive landscape due to continued Canadian stonewalling of that access. We appreciate all the work USTR and USDA have done to enforce the USMCA dairy provisions. And we are grateful for Congresswoman Stefanik’s years-long advocacy on behalf of North Country and Upstate New York dairy farmers.”

“The U.S. Dairy Export Council appreciates Congresswoman Stefanik’s work in leading this bipartisan Congressional message to the Administration today that highlights the need for clarity on next steps in securing the Canadian dairy market access that the U.S. worked so hard to negotiate,”said Krysta Harden, president and CEO of USDEC.“We thank USTR and USDA for the work they have done to date in bringing forward two disputes on this issue. In light of the misguided USMCA dispute panel ruling last month, it is more important than ever that the Administration thinks creatively about addressing the outstanding market access and dairy protein export dumping concerns that remain with Canada. Dairy producers and processors in New York and throughout the country appreciate the support from Representative Stefanik in ensuring U.S. trading partners honor their market access commitments.”

Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and NDAA conferee, today voted to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024.

“As the leading advocate for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, I proudly voted to pass the FY24 national defense bill to secure numerous provisions for the Fort Drum Community and our brave Servicemembers nationwide. This year’s national defense bill increases our military readiness, equips our troops, pushes back against woke ideology in our military, and provides robust support for Servicemembers and their families.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have diligently worked over the past year to bring the defense priorities of Upstate New York and the North Country to the highest levels. I am proud to have crafted, conferenced, and passed a defense bill that ensures Fort Drum soldiers are eligible for Cold Weather location assignment pay, fully equips the 10th MTN Division with cutting-edge technology, and recognizes the vast potential of the unique Upstate New York environment for training our military personnel. While our country faces numerous threats from Communist China, Russia, and Iran, we must bolster our national defense and support our Servicemembers because peace can only be achieved through strength.”

The FY2024 NDAA authorizes $886.3 billion for national defense, an increase of $28 billion from FY 2023, and saves the American taxpayer $37 billion while also authorizing funding for over $2 billion in service chief and combatant commander priorities left unfunded by the Biden Budget.

The NDAA will now go to the President to be signed into law.

Congresswoman Stefanik worked to secure the following provisions in the FY24 NDAA:

Strengthening Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division

Supporting Our Servicemembers and Their Families

Strengthening National Defense

Confronting the CCP and Foreign Adversaries

Keeping Pace with Emerging Technologies in the 21st Century

Following this disturbing notification, I immediately began working on the Servicemember Parents Bill of Rights. After two years of persistent advocacy, the Servicemember Parents Bill of Rights will now be law and Servicemembers with children in DoDEA schools will have the right to be fully informed and involved in their children’s education. As our men and women serving in our military look out for our own safety, I am proud to stand up for them and ensure the rights of our Servicemember parents.”

Title: Stefanik Celebrates Passage of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik celebrated the passage of theWhole Milk for Healthy Kids Acton the House floor. This bill allows school cafeterias to serve flavored and unflavored whole milk.

“Upstate New York and the North Country’s dairy farmers work hard to provide nutritious milk for our families and communities, and I am proud to have supported legislation to give children increased access to their delicious milk products,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act would allow schools to serve flavored and unflavored whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free milk in cafeterias, giving our kids a variety of milk choices. I will always work to increase our children’s access to important dairy nutrition.”

“NMPF thanks Representative Elise Stefanik for her persistent, strong action to ensure that Americans have access to nutritious dairy and the numerous health benefits dairy foods provide. Milk is a nutrition powerhouse and an unparalleled tool for delivering the 13 essential nutrients kids need to grow and thrive. We are grateful for Rep. Stefanik’s leadership and support for the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, which expands the types of milk schools can choose to serve to include 2% and whole milk. NMPF is pleased the House approved the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act today, and we look forward to working with Congress to continue to increase access to nutritious dairy and other healthful foods for all,”said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of National Milk Producers Federation

“IDFA applauds the strong bipartisan passage of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act by the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill would allow schools to once again provide children with a wide variety of milk options that they will drink and that meet their individual needs—whether that be whole and 2%, low-fat milks, or lactose-free milks. Whole milk and reduced-fat milks alike provide children with 13 essential nutrients for growth, development, healthy immune function, and overall wellness. A wide majority of parents and medical and nutrition professionals know that offering these options increases school meal participation, reduces food waste, and provides nutritionally valuable school meals for children and adolescents. IDFA is grateful to Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson, Rep. Kim Schrier, Rep. Elise Stefanik, and the many other lawmakers who for years have championed this effort to reinstate the full suite of nutritious milk options in school meals. We strongly urge the Senate to pass this legislation,”said Michael Dykes, D.V.M., President and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.

"Every student deserves to have healthy, well-balanced meals in school, and studies have shown that milk is an important part of providing growing children with essential vitamins and nutrients. New York Farm Bureau appreciates Rep. Stefanik's support of the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act which will give school districts greater choices of milk on the menu. In turn, this will also support New York's dairy farm families who take pride in producing a healthy product that kids enjoy and need,"said David Fisher, New York Farm Bureau President.

Washington, D.C–In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published anop-edinSun Community Newshighlighting her work ensuring critical funding for Community Health Centers (CHC) that are vital in providing high-quality rural healthcare in Upstate New York and the North Country.

Guest Viewpoint: Community Health Center: Lower Costs, More Transparency Act

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

First opening in 1965 as a way of bringing comprehensive primary care to rural and medically underserved communities, Federally Qualified Health Centers, more commonly referred to as Community Health Centers (CHCs), have steadily grown over the last five decades to play an increasingly vital role in the U.S. healthcare system. CHCs serve as low-cost medical clinics that are open to anyone regardless of their insurance status, making them an important part of our nation’s healthcare safety net. CHCs are especially crucial to Upstate New York and the North Country, where CHC networks including Hudson Headwaters Health Network, Mosaic Health, Community Health Center of the North Country, North Country Family Health Center, Inc., Schenectady Family Health, and United Cerebral Palsy Association of the North Country, Inc. serve over 250,000 people across the region. These CHCs offer a wide range of services that are critical to our communities, ranging from basic preventative medical, dental, vision, and pharmacy care to more advanced treatments for serious and chronic physical and mental health conditions.

Since my first day in office, I have been a tireless advocate for delivering high-quality rural healthcare to our Upstate New York and North Country families, and as a proud Co-Chair of the Community Health Center Caucus in Congress, I have fought hard for long-term funding for our nation’s CHCs. There are over 35 CHC delivery sites in New York’s 21st Congressional District that rely on consistent federal funding to ensure continued access to care. I have staunchly defended and advocated for increased funding for these CHCs, recognizing the immense value they bring to our rural communities. In my time in Congress, I am proud to have been awarded the Distinguished Community Health Center Champion Award for my national leadership by the National Association of Community Health Centers and most recently to have introduced bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to reauthorize federal funding to CHCs.

My bill, the Strengthening Community Care Act of 2023 would reauthorize funding for CHCs through 2028 and provide continued access to care for over 30 million Americans in rural and underserved communities, including over 250,000 patients in my district. A version of this bill was successfully included as part of the House Republicans’ bipartisan Lower Costs, More Transparency Act which overwhelmingly passed through the House on December 11, 2023. My provision in the bill will extend the CHC fund through calendar year 2025 at $4.4 billion per year, an almost $400 million per year increase from previous reauthorizations. This critical funding will give health centers a more stable financial foundation, which allows for even more expansion of services and locations. This legislation that I helped author and pass the House of Representatives will ensure hundreds of thousands of people across my district will continue to have access to low-cost, high-quality healthcare.

The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act is an important piece of legislation that will improve healthcare transparency, reduce healthcare costs, and support patients, healthcare workers, community health centers, and hospitals. I applaud my colleagues in the House for their work to get this done and urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly pass this legislation.

Title: Following Her Strong Advocacy, Stefanik Announces New Multi-Domain Task Force at Fort Drum
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced that following her advocacy, Fort Drum has been selected to host the U.S. Army’s 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF).

“As the chief advocate for Fort Drum in Congress, I worked hard to deliver this result and I am proud to announce that Fort Drum will host the U.S. Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“Fort Drum and its community are well-positioned to play a central role in the Army’s strategy to confront future threats to our national security. The U.S. Army designed MDTFs to address the evolving national security threats our military will be confronted with from Communist China and Russia. Hosting a MDTF at Fort Drum is a great distinction and will further solidify Fort Drum’s importance to the future of the Army’s capability to deter our adversaries and win our nation’s wars. As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, it is one of my greatest honors to represent and advocate for Fort Drum.”

Last year, Congresswoman Stefanikled a letterto the Secretary of the Army advocating for Fort Drum to be selected as the home to a U.S. Army MDTF to combat evolving military threats from Communist China and Russia.

MDTFs represent the centerpiece in operationalizing the Army’s Multi-Domain Operations concept, which brings together the land, air, space, and cyberspace domains to enable the Army to win in competition, crisis, and conflict. Congresswoman Stefanik has worked to ensure that Fort Drum, Upstate New York, and the North Country are uniquely positioned to train in all domains.

In this year’s national defense bill, Congresswoman Stefaniksuccessfullyincludeda provision that requires the Department of Defense to review their ability to train in a contested electronic-warfare environment and acknowledge the defense partnerships that have been established in Upstate New York that conduct research, experimentation, and training in realistic environments. This environment that Congresswoman Stefanik has worked to create is a critical reason why the Army chose Fort Drum to host the 2nd MDTF.

In addition to writing a letter of support to the Army, as a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congresswoman Stefanik has worked to ensure Fort Drum would be prepared to host a MDTF. All of the MDTFs must be able to rapidly deploy to meet the needs of the requesting Combatant Command. After years of advocacy, Congresswoman Stefanik securedover $27 millionto complete the Fort Drum Railhead to expedite the rapid deployment of troops, vehicles, and equipment from the base.

Congresswoman Stefanik has alsoworkedto ensure our Servicemembers and their families in the Fort Drum community are fully supported. In this year’s national defense bill she secured a provision that will enable Fort Drum soldiers to be eligible for additional pay for being assigned in a Cold Weather location.

In 2025, Fort Drum will host 1,495 soldiers that will make up the Long-Range Fires Battalion, Brigade Support Battalion, and Air Defense Battalion of the Army’s 2nd MDTF. In 2021, the Army stationed the Headquarters and Effects Battalion of the 2nd MDTF in Wiesbaden, Germany. The 2nd MDTF supports the U.S. Army in Europe, making Fort Drum the best choice.

Washington, D.C. —On Wednesday, Conference Chairwoman Stefanik, Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Scalise, and Majority Whip Emmer issued the following statement on the House of Representatives passing legislation to formally open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden:

“Today, the House took a critical step in our investigation into serious matters involving President Joe Biden by formally opening an impeachment inquiry. As President Biden continues to stonewall lawful Congressional subpoenas, today’s vote of the fullHouse of Representativesauthorizing the inquiry puts us in the strongest position to enforce these subpoenas in court.

“We do not take this responsibility lightly and will not prejudge the investigation’s outcome. But the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore.

“We have seen witness testimony and bank records showing millions of dollars flowing to the Biden family from foreign adversaries. Witnesses have testified about the President’s numerous interactions with his family’s foreign clients. The President and White House have repeatedly misled the public, shifted the goalposts, and stonewalled our investigation.

“As Chairmen Comer, Jordan and Smith have done all along, we will continue to follow the facts where they lead. The American people deserve answers. This impeachment inquiry will help us find them.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Speaks On Her Bipartisan Resolution Condemning the Presidents of Harvard, MIT, and Penn for Failing to Condemn Antisemitism During Testimony
Date: 2023

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Thank you Mr. Speaker, and thank you to Chairwoman Foxx for chairing last week’s important hearing.

There is a reason that last week's hearing the university presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT made history as the most watched congressional testimony in history with over one billion views. And that's because their testimony was the most morally bankrupt testimony in the history of the United States Congress.

When asked the very specific question, ‘Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your code of conduct on bullying and harassment?’ the world watched, and the world heard their answers in horror. As the President of Harvard, the President, now former, of Penn, and the President of MIT equivocated, dehumanized, and failed to answer ‘Yes.’ Anyone with a sliver of decency, humanity, and morality knows that the answer to that question is 'Yes'.

President Kornbluth of MIT said that such depravity would only be considered harassment depending on the ‘context.’ When pressed during her questioning, Penn's President, now Former President, Magill’s response was shocking to the extreme: ‘If the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment.’ Finally, Harvard President Gay whose answer was the same: ‘It depends on the context.’

It was pathetic, amoral, and inhumane, and by God the world heard it.

And as I said in the hearing, it does not depend on the context. As attacks against Jewish students have skyrocketed on campuses across America, we clearly have tremendous work ahead of us, Mr. Speaker, to address this rot of antisemitism that is now rooted in our once premier higher education institutions. And we will not be deterred by this important work. This is why I rise today in support of my bipartisan resolution condemning the rise of antisemitism on university campuses around the country and the morally bankrupt testimony of those university presidents. It is only a first step but it is an important step.

I commend my colleagues Congressman Moskowitz, Majority Leader Scalise, and Congressman Gottheimer for joining to lead this historically important, bipartisan effort to stand for moral truth.”

Title: Stefanik's Resolution to Condemn Antisemitism on College Campuses and The Shocking Testimony of Campus Leadership Passes on the House Floor

Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the passage of her resolution to condemn antisemitism on college campuses and the shocking testimony of the campus leadership from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Pennsylvania at the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing last week.

“The passage of my resolution marks a historic bipartisan effort to stand for moral truth. The world is watching as Members from both sides of the aisle stand resolutely with the Jewish people to condemn antisemitism on university campuses and the morally bankrupt testimony of the Harvard, MIT, and Penn university presidents during last week’s House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing.

It is disappointing and revealing that 128 Democrats chose to vote against condemning antisemitism on college campuses and the pathetic and abhorrent testimony of the university presidents."

Newsweek: It's Time to Shed Some Light on U.S. Investment in Communist China | Opinion

By Rep. Elise Stefanik and Senator Marco Rubio

“Do you know where your retirement savings are being invested? If you're like most Americans, the answer is likely no. Once a dollar enters an index fund, few people have the time, knowhow, or resources to track it to its final destination.

That is all well and good so long as we can trust regulators and investment firms to align with our values and financial interests. But increasingly, we can't. A recent investigation revealed that hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. index funds are going to companies tasked by the Chinese Communist Party to weaken America—and whose accounting is dangerously opaque.

Over the years, Congress has passed laws to mitigate this. It has required the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce to record the recipients of outbound U.S. investment. More recently, via the passage of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which we worked closely on, Congress has required foreign companies listing on U.S. stock exchanges to follow the same auditing standards as their American competitors. But these efforts are no longer enough.

For one, the Treasury and Commerce reports are frequently inaccurate. Treasury usually lists the Cayman Islands as America's top foreign investment destination. But when the department issues its annual correction for shell firms, China takes the Caymans' place.

This is compounded by the fact that Treasury doesn't track which Chinese industries receive more U.S. investment than others, while the Commerce Department issues no shell-firm corrections at all. In short, there is a great deal going on that regulators, lawmakers, and investors are completely blind to.

Moreover, the Chinese Communist Party is doing everything in its power to prevent rigorous auditing of Chinese companies. Last year, Beijing retaliated against U.S. financial investigations by raiding the China-based offices of Western auditors, like Deloitte and Mintz, and pressuring Chinese companies to only use more firmly state-controlled Chinese auditors. Beijing also cut all Western access to the Wind Terminal, which contains crucial Chinese business data, and it banned negative comments about China's regulatory environment from entering Chinese firms' offshore listing documents.

Congress can't respond to this obfuscation and resistance with complacence. To the contrary, we must increase the pressure on Wall Street and Beijing. It's what the national and financial security of the American people demand. Accordingly, we have introduced two new bills to shed more light on U.S. investment in China.

Our American Investment Accountability Act would require the Treasury and Commerce Departments to issue more accurate quarterly reports for shell firms, break down outbound investments by industry, and disclose particular investments in sanctioned entities. Our bill would also require the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report all joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, spinoffs, and green-field investments in countries of concern, like Communist China.

Additionally, our Trusted Foreign Auditing Act builds on the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to require publicly traded companies that are vetted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to retain independent auditors who are free from Beijing's influence. If a company will not comply with this requirement, then our bill would remove them from all U.S. stock exchanges.

Neither of these is a silver bullet to the problems facing our financial system, but each is a worthwhile step. Americans trust their system to work for them, not for their greatest adversary. We need straightforward legislation to keep dangerous Communist Chinese companies from swallowing the hard-earned savings of American teachers, first responders, and military service-members.”

We must have greater visibility into how U.S. investment is strengthening the capabilities of our adversaries.”

Title: Stefanik, Moskowitz, Scalise, & Gottheimer Introduce Bipartisan Resolution Condemning Antisemitism on University Campuses and Committee Testimony from Penn, Harvard, & MIT Presidents
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Congressman Jared Moskowitz (D-FL), Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) introduced aresolutioncondemning the testimony of presidents from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of Pennsylvania as well as calling from the immediate resignation of the remaining presidents at Harvard and MIT.

“This is not a partisan issue but a question of moral clarity which is why our colleagues from across the aisle have come together with us to introduce a resolution condemning antisemitism on university campuses as well as the morally bankrupt testimonies of the University Presidents from Harvard, Penn, and MIT during last week’s House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“We are only just beginning to address the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has infected America’s higher education system and we will not stop until it is rooted out and those responsible for fostering its growth are held accountable. Antisemitism has no place in America.”

“These are Ivy League university presidents that were asked a softball question: ‘Does calling for the genocide of Jews count as harassment under their school’s policies?’ That’s not a trick question, and it’s infuriating that these leaders of young people would try to equivocate with some nonsense about ‘it depends on the context.’ Sub out Jews for any other persecuted minority group and they would never have given that answer. They failed the test, and just like their students there are no makeups,”said Congressman Jared Moskowitz.

“When Chair Stefanik asked the presidents of MIT, Harvard, and University of Pennsylvania if calling for the genocide of Jews constituted harassment and violated their codes of conduct, we should have heard a simple and resounding ‘yes.’ This was not a hard question – in fact, it was probably the easiest question they could have answered. The abject failure of these presidents to defend even the most basic of human rights – the right to exist – against hypocritical wokeism exposed the moral bankruptcy at these elite universities to the world,”said Majority Leader Steve Scalise.“We must, as a nation, stand united with the Jewish people and Jewish students who no longer feel safe in the United States or on our campuses against the hateful antisemitism they are facing today. We must stand up for what is right. I applaud Chair Stefanik for introducing this resolution condemning the despicable testimony of those three university presidents and am proud to join her in denouncing the antisemitism running rampant on college campuses.”

“Students are scared to be Jewish on campus and these presidents’ answers before Congress reinforced their failures of leadership over the last few months. I will always defend the right to free speech, even when what’s being said is incredibly offensive. But, I won’t sit back when words and actions violate the law, instill fear, and put students in danger. There is a right to freedom of speech, but there is also a freedom of fear when at school. As a dad, I don’t ever want any student — regardless of background — to feel scared to be who they are at school,”said Congressman Josh Gottheimer.

Title: Stefanik Statement on Passage of Reauthorization of Community Health Center Funding
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, theLower Costs More Transparency Actwhich included theStrengthening Community Care ActCongresswoman Elise Stefanik helped introduce passed the House with broad bipartisan support. This bill will extend the Community Health Center Fund through 2025 at $4.4 billion annually and the National Health Service Corps through 2025 at $350 million annually, ensuring communities across the district have access to low-cost, high-quality care.

“I am proud that the House passed legislation which included a bill I introduced earlier this year to extend the Community Health Center Fund and the National Health Service Corps through 2025 providing Community Health Centers (CHCs) with critically needed resources to meet NY21’s healthcare needs. CHCs provide necessary healthcare and preventative services for families across Upstate New York and the North Country. Extending this funding is imperative for NY21’s CHCs to equip them with resources to serve over 250,000 patients in my district,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Since my first day in office, I have been a tireless advocate for delivering high-quality rural healthcare to our Upstate New York and North Country families, and as a proud Co-Chair of the Community Health Center Caucus in Congress, I have fought hard for long-term funding for our nation’s CHCs. This critical funding will give health centers a more stable financial foundation, which allows for even more expansion of services and locations.”

“Investing in community health centers and their staff has never been more important than right now, and the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act does both: doubling Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education funding, increasing National Health Service Corps funding, and guaranteeing $4.4 billion per year in health center funding through the end of 2025,”said Community Health Care Association of NY President and CEO Rose Duhan.“Passing HR 5378 helps ensure health centers will have the funding and the providers they need to give their patients the high-quality, comprehensive care they deserve. Thank you, Congresswoman Stefanik, for your continued support of community health centers in New York State.”

“Throughout her work in Congress, U.S. Rep. Stefanik has demonstrated unwavering support for the mission and accomplishments of Community Health Centers, which serve 31.5 million people nationwide,”said Joe Dunn, Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy at the National Association of Community Health Centers.“Her leadership in advancing bipartisan legislation that provides increased funding for health centers through theLower Costs, More Transparency Actensures millions of Americans in small towns and rural communities can access essential and affordable preventive primary care. As a longtime champion, Rep. Stefanik understands the value and efficiencies that Community Health Centers bring to the U.S. healthcare system, and we are incredibly grateful for her support.”

“As a nonprofit, community health center, our mission is to provide high-quality primary and preventive health care throughout Upstate New York,”said Hudson Headwaters CEO Tucker Slingerland, M.D.“Now more than ever, our efforts to expand vital access relies on our partnerships with hospitals, public health and other health care organizations, along with bipartisan support from Congress so that collectively, our health care system meets the needs of medically underserved communities.We appreciate the efforts of Congresswoman Stefanik and our other federal and state representatives for the ongoingsupportand resources to provide high-quality, community-based health care.”

“As a Community Health Center serving the North Country region of New York State we witness every day the extraordinary role Health Centers play in improving access to high quality preventive and primary healthcare services to our patients,”said North Country Family Health Center CEO Joey Marie Horton.“The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act ensures that our Health Center and the thousands more within the United States have the resources we need to continue to provide high quality services which are provided in an accessible, affordable, and patient-centered manner. We value Congresswomen Stefanik’s continued support of this important model of healthcare delivery.”

“The passage of the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act is welcome news for those of us providing care in the 21st District, and indeed the entire country. The provision Congresswoman Stefanik authored to extend the Community Health Center Fund through calendar year 2025 at $4.4 billion per year, obviously hits close to home for those of us at Community Health Centers (CHCs). The positive impact on Teaching Health Centers and the National Health Service Corp must not be overlooked either. For almost sixty years we have been fortunate to have bi-partisan support for CHCs across this country, but we never take that tax payer funded support for granted. It has dramatically improved access to care for millions of Americans, including just over a quarter of a million who receive equitable access to care at the 35 CHCs across the 21st District. We truly appreciate everyone involved with this legislation, and for Congresswoman Stefanik’s unwavering support,”said Raymond Babowicz, Director of Communications and Strategic Partnerships at the Community Health Center of the North Country.

In April 2023, Congresswoman Stefanik helpedintroducetheStrengthening Community Care Act of 2023which reauthorizes funding for Community Health Centers through 2028 and provides continued access to care for over 30 million Americans in rural and underserved communities, including over 250,000 patients in New York’s 21st District.

East Greenbush, N.Y. -House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik released the following statement regarding the resignation of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill:

“One down. Two to go.

This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most “prestigious” higher education institutions in America.

This forced resignation of the President of Penn is the bare minimum of what is required.

These universities can anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions' negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, and overall leadership and governance.

Harvard and MIT, do the right thing. The world is watching.

In the case of Harvard, President Gay was asked by me 17 times whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard’s code of conduct. She spoke her truth 17 times. And the world heard.

In the case of MIT, Dr. Kornbluth answered the question. “If targeted at individuals” ie dehumanizing the Jewish people in her answer.”

Washington, D.C.--Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Congressman Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) sent a bipartisanletterto the board members of Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Pennsylvania demanding the immediate dismissal of the three campus presidents and provide an action plan to ensure the protection of Jewish and Israeli students, faculty and community.

Stefanik and Moskowitz were joined by 72 of their Congressional colleagues in their demands.

The letter states,

Jewish students should have found comfort on their campuses. Instead, many Jewish and Israeli students have faced an increasingly hostile educational environment, in the form of targeted harassment, protesters calling for the elimination of the Jewish state, and even acts of violence.According to a recent survey by ADL and Hillel International, 73% of Jewish college students surveyed have experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism on campus since the beginning of the school year. This is unacceptable. Antisemitism has been allowed to fester on campuses for years, and in the wake of the October 7" attack, the world is witnessing the consequences.

The letter continues,

This is a clear result of the failure of university leadership. To hold universities accountable,Congress held a hearing on confronting campus antisemitism. Testimony provided by presidents of your institutions showed a complete absence of moral clarity and illuminated the problematic double standards and dehumanization of the Jewish communities that your university presidents enabled.The university presidents' responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent. When pushed on whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates university policies on bullying or harassment, Presidents Gay (Harvard), Kornbluth (MIT), and Magill (Penn) were evasive and dismissive, failing to simply condemn such action. This should have been an easy and resounding "yes."

In conclusion, the letter demands,

Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses. Anything less than these steps will be seen as your endorsement of what Presidents Gay, Magill, and Kornbluth said to Congress and an act of complicity in their antisemitic posture. The world is watching - you can stand with your Jewish students and faculty, or you can choose the side of dangerous antisemitism.

Title: ICYMI: The New York Sun: Elise Stefanik Tells the Sun She Predicts ‘an Earthquake in Higher Education’ as Congress Prepares Antisemitism Probe of the Heads of Harvard, Penn, and MIT
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik spoke withThe New York Sunfollowing her line of questioning at the House Education and the Workforce Committee Hearing with campus presidents from Harvard, MIT, and UPenn demanding accountability for their role enabling antisemitism on campus.

The Sun:Elise Stefanik Tells the Sun She Predicts ‘an Earthquake in Higher Education’ as Congress Prepares Antisemitism Probe of the Heads of Harvard, Penn, and MIT

Ms. Stefanik says the university leaders cannot stay in power after failing to call genocidal language against Jewish students bullying or harassment.

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, fresh from her confrontation in a hearing with the presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT, is declaring that higher education is at a “watershed moment” and predicts it will be difficult for the three university leaders to remain in their jobs after dodging the questions that her committee asked them early this week.

In conversation with the Sun by telephone, Ms. Stefanik, who is a Harvard alumna and the fourth-ranking House Republican, predicted that a probe into the universities, announced by the House on Thursday, will lead to their presidents’  terminations.  By her count, Harvard president Claudine Gay gave shifting and irresolute answers to her now-viral query from the Tuesday hearing — if calling for the genocide of Jews constitutes bullying and harassment in violation of the school’s code of conduct — 17 times.

The mounting fight against Harvard could be as significant as the epic lawsuit brought on by the group, Students for Fair Admissions, challenging racial preferences — and discrimination against Asians — in the school’s admissions policies. Harvard belittled that suit when it began but eventually lost by a six to two margin in the Supreme Court — Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself — on the basis of violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The university is likely now aware that it is not above the law and is in dangerous legal waters.

“This is a watershed moment. There will be tectonic consequences of this hearing, and it will be an earthquake in higher education,” Ms. Stefanik tells the Sun. “My fear,” she says, “is that when we conduct this investigation, what we are going to uncover is antisemitism very deep in these institutions of higher learning, some of which were founded, in Harvard’s case, before the founding of our country.”

It is unclear what the Constitutional contours of the coming clash will be, as it is not the job of Congress to determine individual guilt. Yet it is clear that Ms. Stefanik, who serves as the House Republican Conference Chairwoman, is not comfortable with university leaders standing by while Jewish students on their campuses are being physically assaulted in the library, hiding their identities in the classroom, and threatened genocide across the quad.

“Unrecognizable,” “shameful,” and “heartbreaking:” that’s how Ms. Stefanik describes Harvard, from where she graduated in 2006 and served as vice president of the school’s Institute of Politics. While the Ivy League institution was founded on the pursuit of truth, or Veritas, it and other top universities “have drifted so, so far from that,” she says, “in their effort to appease the radical far left.”

Ms. Stefanik predicts that all three of the presidents will be fired after repeatedly failing to answer her question, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university’s] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying or harassment?” She says that “the world knows what the right thing is, and that is they need to fire the president. They need to fire any professor, any department head, who cannot answer that question correctly.”

What the footage of Ms. Stefanik’s line of questioning that went viral does not show is that throughout the course of the five-hour hearing, she asked Ms. Gay that question 17 times, “and she failed 17 times,” she says. “Yes it was combative, because as anyone asking that question would be, I was appalled by the answers.” Recalling the “smugness” the trio of leaders displayed before Congress, she said, “they didn’t realize what they were saying was so, so wrong.”

Several Jewish university students who were in the audience at Capitol Hill appeared visibly distressed by the university presidents’ inability to call rhetoric supporting genocide bullying or harassment. “You could see how shaken up they were,” recounts Ms. Stefanik. “They were physically shaking, listening to the answers of those questions.”

The House Education and the Workforce Committee, which convened the hearing on Tuesday, will now investigate the schools, says chairwoman Virginia Foxx, using the “full force of subpoena power.” The board of advisors at Penn’s business school has called on the university president, Liz Magill, to immediately step down. Famed hedge fund manager and Harvard alumnus, Bill Ackman, says that all three leaders now “must resign in disgrace.”

Ms. Gay issued a statement on Wednesday in an attempt to quell the national outrage at her testimony. “Let me be clear,” she said, “calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group, are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.” On Thursday, Ms. Gay went further, telling the Harvard Crimson she was “sorry” and that “words matter.”

Ms. Magill of Penn has also attempted to backpedal her remarks at Capitol Hill, where she said that the decision to punish blatant antisemitism depends on the “context” and would only violate the school’s code of conduct “if the speech turns into conduct.” On Wednesday, she said in a statement that such behavior, “in my view,” does indeed constitute “harassment or intimidation.”

Asked by the Sun about the coming House inquiry, MIT’s spokeswoman, Kimberly Allen, says that “MIT rejects antisemitism in all its forms. Antisemitism is real and rising in the world. We cannot let it poison our community.” The university, she says, “will work with the Committee to address its questions.”

The chairman of the MIT Corporation, the venture capitalist Mark Gorenberg, said in a statement Thursday that he “and the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation entirely support President Kornbluth.” The press offices of Harvard and Penn did not respond to the Sun’s requests for comment.

The statements this week from university leaders are mere “PR cover-ups,” says Ms. Stefanik. “No amount of cleaning up is going to make up for their responses under oath.”

More than one billion people are said to have viewed the hearing on Tuesday, making it “the most viewed congressional testimony in the history of the United States Congress,” says Ms. Stefanik. “The reason was the pathetic answers by the three university presidents, who will be former university presidents pretty soon here.”

Calls to hold the heads of Harvard, Penn, and MIT accountable are garnering praise from both Republicans and Democrats. “This is beyond politics,” Ms. Stefanik asserts. “This is an issue of moral clarity.”

Ms. Koch graduated in 2023 from Harvard College, where she was the editor-in-chief of the student weekly, the Harvard Independent. She reports on issues of higher education and foreign policy at The New York Sun.

Title: Stefanik, Wittman Demand Action on Communist Chinese Control of Critical Minerals
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA) led aletterto Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin urging him to develop a plan to address the national security ramifications of Communist China’s interest and investment in seabed mining.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“Under previous U.S. national strategies to address critical mineral supply chain risks dating back to 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) is charged with efforts to, “stabilize and strengthen the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) Program’s ability to respond rapidly to urgent and unanticipated military and essential civilian requirements during wartime and other national emergencies.” In keeping with the DOD’s mandate to continue improving the resilience of national defense supply chains, we write today to emphasize the importance of evaluating and planning for seabed mining as a new vector of competition with China for resource superiority and security.”

“I am calling on the Biden Administration’s Department of Defense to develop a plan and engage with our allies to prevent Communist China from taking complete control of critical mineral supply chains,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Critical minerals are essential for technology that Americans use every day and make up key components of our advanced weapons systems. We cannot allow Communist China to dominate the critical mineral supply chain.”

Stefanik and Wittman are joined by Reps. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), Jen Kiggans (R-VA), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Randy Weber (R-TX), Mark Alford (R-MO), Michael Turner (R-OH), Michael Waltz (R-FL), James Moylan (R-Guam), Pat Fallon (R-TX), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO) , Pete Sessions (R-TX), Nancy Mace (R-SC), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL), Cory Mills (R-FL), David Rouzer (R-NC), Jake LaTurner (R-KS), Nicholas Langworthy (R-NY), Morgan Luttrell (R-TX), Rich McCormick (R-GA), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Keith Self (R-TX), Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Brian Babin (R-TX) and Ronny Jackson (R-TX).

Title: Stefanik Statement On Committee on Education & the Workforce Announcing Investigations Into MIT, Harvard, & Penn Following Their Inability To Condemn Antisemitism
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C -Today, House Republican Conference Chair and senior member of the Committee on Education & the Workforce Elise Stefanik released the following statement regarding House Republicans announcing an investigation into the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University after their Presidents were unable to condemn antisemitism on their campuses during the Chairwoman’s line ofquestioningat the hearing earlier this week.

“After this week's pathetic and morally bankrupt testimony by university presidents when answering my questions, the Education and Workforce Committee is launching an official Congressional investigation with the full force of subpoena power into Penn, MIT, & Harvard and others,"stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“We will use our full Congressional authority to hold these schools accountable for their failure on the global stage."

From theHouse Committee on Education & the Workforce:

Today, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement in the wake of Tuesday’s committee hearing with the presidents of Harvard, UPenn, and MIT:

"The testimony we received earlier this week from Presidents Gay, Magill, and Kornbluth about the responses of Harvard, UPenn, and MIT to the rampant antisemitism displayed on their campuses by students and faculty was absolutely unacceptable.

“Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law.

"Given those institutional and personal failures, the Committee is opening a formal investigation into the learning environments at Harvard, UPenn, and MIT and their policies and disciplinary procedures. This investigation will include substantial document requests, and the Committee will not hesitate to utilize compulsory measures including subpoenas if a full response is not immediately forthcoming.

“The disgusting targeting and harassment of Jewish students is not limited to these institutions, and other universities should expect investigations as well, as their litany of similar failures has not gone unnoticed.”

Title: Stefanik Votes to Pass DETERRENT Act on the Floor
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted to pass legislation she helped introduce, theDefending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions (DETERRENT) Act. This legislation brings necessary oversight and transparency to foreign gift reporting requirements to help colleges and universities across the country counter foreign influence and protect our nation’s students.

This bill also includes theHalting Academic Liaisons To (HALT)our Adversaries Act which Congresswoman Stefanik introduced earlier this year to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not contribute to the advancement of the militaries of Communist China or the Russian Federation.

“Harvard President Claudine Gay’s refusal to answer my question about whether Harvard University received $1.5 billion in funding from foreign entities and governments for its Middle East Studies Department at yesterday’s Education and Workforce hearing is a prime example of why the DETERRENT Act is desperately needed to hold colleges and universities across America accountable and bring transparency to foreign gift reporting,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “The American people have a right to know how foreign governments are influencing our colleges and universities.”

Watch her full interview here.

On Questioning the Presidents of “So-Called” Elite Universities:

“Well, Harris, I’ve been in a number of very high-profile Congressional hearings over the years, and the pathetic, moral depravity on display by the witnesses, the three university presidents from Harvard, MIT, and Penn, I’ve never witnessed anything like that. And I asked the question in such a way that it was an easy yes, that calling for the genocide of Jews in fact does violate their policies and code of conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment. And their answers were pathetic. I was so shaken, Harris, and what was probably the most tragic aspect of the hearing to me was there were a number of Jewish students from those schools in the audience sitting behind them, and to watch, just the fear, as they’re listening to the presidents of these universities fail to answer a basic question of moral clarity, it was abysmal. They don’t deserve the dignity of resigning. They need to be fired.”

On Jewish Students Being Attacked On College Campuses Across The Country:

“It is a threat, Harris, and I have heard, not only from Jewish alumni, but Jewish students who feel unsafe when they go to their classes. Who are threatened with physical assaults, who have been physically assaulted, who take the Mezuzahs down from their doorways, who fear wearing Stars of David. It’s absurd that this is happening in the twenty-first century on so-called elite college campuses. I’m a graduate of Harvard University, and this should never happen at Harvard or anywhere. And the reality, Harris, is if you put three middle schoolers across America and ask them the same question, they would correctly answer the question and say that it’s wrong. And the fact that these presidents of universities could not answer it. It has rotted out our ivory towers and these intellectual institutions who do not understand moral clarity.”

On Asking If The Genocide Of Jews Constitutes Harrassment And Not Getting A Straight Answer:

“Well, in her testimony, Harris, she actually said it will take conduct or action. So of course, I followed up and said, ‘What do you mean it will take action? The act of committing genocide?’ And she couldn’t even answer that ‘yes.’ It was absurd to have that back and forth. That’s why they’re not fit to be in those positions, and this is not just an issue in the United States, Harris, this is a global scourge that we are seeing of the rise of antisemitism.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik in The Crimson: Harvard Must Find Its Moral Clarity

Washington, D.C. -In case you missed it, Congresswoman and Harvard alumna Elise Stefanik’sop-edin Harvard University’s student paperThe Crimsonaddressed Harvard President Claudia Gay’s failure to condemn the blatant antisemitism and anti-Israel rhetoric spreading across Harvard’s campuses.

Today, Congresswoman Stefanik will question President Gay at the House Ed and Workforce Committee Hearing on holding campus leaders accountable and confronting antisemistism.

Find Rep. Stefanik’s full op-ed below.

The Crimson: Harvard Must Find Its Moral Clarity

During the American Revolution, America’s colleges served as bastions of moral clarity, leveraging the teachings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to bolster America’s fight for freedom and democracy. Harvard took part in shaping this revolutionary fervor. General George Washington even quartered his troops in the historic Massachusetts and Hollis Halls.

Today, Harvard University has been so corrupted by its apparent desperation to appease the far-left that its moral compass has been long forgotten. It is profoundly disappointing to see Harvard University, a prestigious institution which we care so deeply about, devolve from fostering an age of American independence into an institution that enables abhorrent antisemitism.

On Oct. 7,Iranian-backed Hamas terroristsinvaded Israel and brutally murdered more than 1,000 Israeli civilians, leading to thedeadliest dayfor the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas terroristsmassacred concertgoers,raped women, barbaricallyburned people alive,beheaded babies, andkidnapped more than 200innocent men, women, and children, many of whom arestill being held captiveby Hamas in Gaza.

As the free world watched in horror at the grotesque Hamas attack, evil antisemitism erupted on America’s college campuses. Following the attack, more than 30 Harvard student organizations co-signed apublic statementin response to Hamas’ attack claiming that Israel was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” These Harvard student groups effectively blamed Israel for the unimaginable atrocities that Hamas inflicted on Israeli civilians.

While this statement is sickening and multiple groups have sinceretracted their signatures, what is worse is the failure of Harvard’s leadership to immediately condemn the statement. Harvard’s silence created a vacuum in which heinous antisemitism echoes loudly.

To fill this void, I led my fellow Harvard alumni on Capitol Hill in a letter condemning the statement and demanding that University President Claudine Gay denounce antisemitism. Yet throughout President Claudine Gay’snumerous statementsat this point, she has never condemned the Harvard student organizations; instead, she has declared that Harvard is committed to creating an environment that fosters free speech and open dialogue.

Harvard alumni and students are well aware that the University stifles free speech; recently, Harvard rankeddead lastin the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s college free speech rankings. Strikingly, in multiple of President Claudine Gay’s remarks responding to the Israel-Hamas war, she has stressed Harvard’s commitment to freedom of speech,even saying, “It’s in the exercise of our freedom to speak that we reveal our characters. And we reveal the character of our institution.”

President Claudine Gay has certainly revealed the lack of character of Harvard as an institution — coupled with Harvard’s abysmal record of protecting free speech, the willingness of Harvard University to now vehemently defend free speech whenthat speechcalls forthe death of Jews and the eradication of Israel is absolutely revelatory in Harvard’s unacceptable lack of moral clarity.

This rot of antisemitism is not only plaguing Harvard University but is proliferating on campuses all over the country. While these universities desperately attempt to appease the far-left through hiring an army of diversity, equity, and inclusion officers, a professor at Cornell University claimed that Hamas’ murdering and hostage taking on Oct. 7made him feel exhilarated. A group of students atGeorge Washington Universityprojected “Free Palestine from the river to the sea,” a phrase calling for the eradication of the state of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish people.

The plague of antisemitism on our college campuses is rotting out these institutions, and it must be stopped.

Universities across America receive billions of taxpayer dollars through federal grants, contracts, and tax incentives. It is unacceptable, and frankly un-American, that taxpayer dollars are supportingHarvard professors— evendepartment chairs— and students who are defending the phrase, “from the river to the sea,” which implies genocidal elimination of the Jewish state. This is why I am working to ban federal funds from any university that enables antisemitism to proliferate on their campus.

House Republicans willinvestigate how universitieslike Harvard have devolved from helping lead our nation in the fight for independence to promulgating terrorist apologists. To ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment, I will work in Congress to demand that America’s colleges and universities implement institutional changes to rid antisemitism from their campuses.

As a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the United States Congress, and a Harvard alumna, I will hold President Claudine Gay accountable when she is under oath today for her responsibility in allowing antisemitism to proliferate on Harvard’s campus and continue to call for her resignation.

As a Harvard alumna, I believe we must demand that the most well-recognized and preeminent higher education institution in the world rediscover its moral clarity and eliminate antisemitism from its campus.

Title: ICYMI: During Questions from Stefanik, Presidents of Harvard, UPENN, & MIT Refuse to Condemn Calls for Genocide of Jews
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Following herfirst round of questionsin today’s Committee on Education & the Workforce hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism,” Congresswoman Stefanik continued to question Harvard University President Claudine Gay, MIT University President Sally Kornbluth, and UPenn President, Elizabeth Magill about the rise of antisemitism on their campuses.

In her final line of questioning, the Presidents refused to say whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” is bullying and harassment according to their codes of conduct. Even going so far to say it needs to turn to “action” first.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Dr. Kornbluth, at MIT, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate MIT’s code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?

President Kornbluth:If targeted at individuals not making public statements.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Yes or no, calling for the genocide of Jews does not constitute bullying and harassment?

President Kornbluth:I have not heard calling for the genocide for Jews on our campus.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you've heard chants for Intifada.

President Kornbluth:I've heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So those would not be, according to the MIT's code of conduct or rules.

President Kornbluth:That would be investigated as harassment if pervasive and severe.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Ms. Magill at Penn, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or code of conduct? Yes or no?

President Magill:If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I am asking, specifically calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment?

President Magill:If it is directed, and severe, pervasive, it is harassment.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So the answer is yes.

President Magill:It is a context dependent decision, Congresswoman.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It's a context dependent decision. That's your testimony today, calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context, that is not bullying or harassment. This is the easiest question to answer. Yes, Ms. Magill. So is your testimony that you will not answer yes? Yes or no?

President Magill:If the speech becomes conduct. It can be harassment, yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide. The speech is not harassment. This is unacceptable. Ms. Magill, I'm gonna give you one more opportunity for the world to see your answer. Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's Code of Conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment? Yes or no?

President Magill:It can be harassment.

Congresswoman Stefanik:The answer is yes. And Dr. Gay at Harvard? Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment? Yes or no?

President Gay:It can be depending on the context.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What's the context?

President Gay:Targeted at an individual targeted, as at an individual?

Congresswoman Stefanik:It's targeted at Jewish students, Jewish individuals. Do you understand your testimony is dehumanizing them? Do you understand that dehumanization is part of antisemitism? I will ask you one more time. Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment? Yes or no?

President Gay:Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct, and we do take action.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So the answer is yes. That calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard Code of Conduct. Correct?

President Gay:Again, it depends on the context.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It does not depend on the context the answer is yes, and this is why you should resign. These are unacceptable answers across the board.

Title: Stefanik, Gallagher, McCaul call on Commerce to Strengthen Export Controls Before Congress Provides More Funding
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul (R-TX), released the joint statement below following Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's call for additional funds for the Bureau of Industry and Security--the Department's enforcement arm for export controls.

“Before we agree to work with Secretary Raimondo to provide additional resources to the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce must institute necessary reforms to keep U.S. technology from our adversaries. Resources alone will not address the shortcomings in our export control regime. Revoking Huawei licenses, adding BGI and Inspur subsidiaries to the Entity List, or cutting SMIC off from U.S. technology is not a matter of money, but political will. Any conversation about additional resources must be matched with actions that demonstrate BIS is being reformed into a true national security agency that will do what needs to be done to counter China and other adversaries.”

On combating the rise of antisemitism at colleges and universities across America

“It is abhorrent, Ainsley. It is heinous. This rise and really explosion of antisemitism on college campuses is fundamentally un-American. Today’s hearing is incredibly important to hold these university Presidents accountable. I’m very focused on what’s been allowed to fester at Harvard. The fact that President Claudine Gay, that’s the president of Harvard University, was silent after over thirty student groups blamed Israel for the Hamas terrorist attacks that slaughtered over one thousand Israelis. The fact that the university was silent is unacceptable. I’ve called for her resignation. But the American people can be assured there will be tough questions for these university presidents today because we want to make sure that antisemitism, that we root it out at its core. It has no place in our university and higher education institutions. And look at the assaults that our Jewish students have been facing. It is unacceptable to have that at any college or university in America.”

On the Impeachment Inquiry into President Joe Biden

“You know it is important that we continue to move the process forward to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people. This vote on the impeachment inquiry would make sure that we are at the apex of our Congressional power. There has been, no surprises, stonewalling, from responding to subpoenas, and turning over documents. And we want to make sure that the Congress is able to hear from all the witnesses. This allows us to have those closed door depositions which are very important prior to open hearings. So, I anticipate an impeachment inquiry vote imminently, certainly before the end of the year. Ultimately, it's the Speaker's decision to make, but our members want to make sure that we have all the facts that I believe will uncover the greatest political scandal in our nation's history.”

…

“That is true Ainsley, and we would not know that were it not for the great Oversight work of Jamie Comer and his Committee. And bank records don't lie Ainsley, the mainstream media, they may refuse to report this, but whether it's checks $240,000, made out to Joe Biden from his family who benefited from adversaries like Communist China, like Russia, or whether it's this monthly payroll, bank records do not lie.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins House Republicans and College Students to Discuss the Rise of Antisemitism At American Universities
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, DC --Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues, and students from Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, New York University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to highlight the rise of antisemitism at colleges and universities across America and how House Republicans are working to protect Jewish students from antisemitism that these colleges and universities have failed to condemn.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“This is a very important day on the House Education and Workforce Committee. We're about to have an incredibly important hearing, addressing the rise of antisemitism on our college campuses and universities. Joining us today to share their personal stories we have four incredibly brave students: Talia, Bella, Eyal, and Jonathan.

Jewish students, faculty, and communities at these so-called elite institutions, including my alma mater, Harvard, Jewish students are facing sustained attacks from students and professors who are openly propagandizing terror. And why? Merely because these Jewish students exist.

In response, campus leadership has cowered to the woke antisemitic mob. This fanaticism against Israel is rooted in ignorance and hatred. Our institutions of higher education are failing our next generation. They are failing Talia, Bella, Eyal, Jonathan, and countless other students.

The attacks on October 7th shocked the conscience of the world marking the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust; however, these atrocities were met with callous cruelty at universities across America. At Harvard, thirty radical student organizations disgustingly blamed Israel for the barbaric attacks against innocent Israelis, only for the groups’ actions to be brazenly defended by Harvard President Claudine Gay as, ‘free expression.’

Following our remarks today, the students will join my colleagues at the Education and Workforce Committee hearing where Harvard, MIT, and Penn’s leadership will likely defend, desperately, their indefensible recent actions and the campus culture that has enabled antisemitism on their campuses.

Any voice who openly defends the massacre of innocents has chosen the side of terrorism. I continue to demand that Harvard President Claudine Gay resign and that Harvard and schools like it are prohibited from collecting taxpayer dollars.

In the words of a Holocaust Survivor and Jewish advocate who dedicated his life to ensuring the horrors of the Holocaust are not forgotten famously said, ‘For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing.’

House Republicans refuse to do NOTHING. In the last few months, under this Speaker’s leadership, we have passed bipartisan resolutions in support of our most precious ally, Israel, holding college campuses accountable, and bringing transparency to the progressive propaganda pushed on American students and paid for by our foreign adversaries. We passed an Israeli aid package sitting with Chuck Schumer in the Senate.  This week, House Republicans will bring the DETERRENT Act to the House Floor, ensuring our foreign enemies cannot buy the minds of American students and protecting our national security and our college and universities’ research. We will continue to fight this scourge of antisemitism on college campuses across this country.

To discuss this further, I want to turn this over to the Chairwoman of the Education and Workforce Committee, who has been a leader on this issue, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Demands Answers from Harvard President Claudine Gay on Harvard’s Failure to Condemn Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Attacks on Campus
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today during the Committee on Education & the Workforce hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism,” Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Harvard University alumni, questioned Harvard President Claudine Gay about Harvard’s failure to condemn antisemitic and anti-Israel bigotry on their campuses following the terrorist attacks on Israel committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Dr. Gay, a Harvard student calling for the mass murder of African Americans is not protected free speech at Harvard, correct?

President Gay:Our commitment to free speech -

Congresswoman Stefanik:It’s a yes or no question. Is that correct? Is that okay for students to call for the mass murder of African Americans at Harvard? Is the protected free speech?

President Gay:Our commitment to free speech -

Congresswoman Stefanik:It’s a yes or no question. Let me ask you this: you are president of Harvard so I assume you are familiar with the term “Intifada,” correct?

President Gay:I have heard that term, yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And you understand that the use of the term “intifada” in the context of the Israeli-Arab conflict is indeed a call for violent armed resistance against the State of Israel, including violence against civilians and the genocide of Jews. Are you aware of that?

President Gay:That type of hateful speech is personally abhorrent to me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And there have been multiple marches at Harvard with student chanting “There is only one solution. Intifada revolution” and “Globalize the Intifada,” is that correct?

President Gay:I’ve heard that thoughtless, reckless, and hateful language on our campus, yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So based upon your testimony, you understand that this call for intifada is to commit genocide against the Jewish people in Israel and globally, correct?

President Gay:I will say again, that type of hateful speech is personally abhorrent to me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s Code of Conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?

President Gay:It is at odds with the values of Harvard.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Can you not say here that it is against the Code of Conduct at Harvard?

President Gay:We embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful - it’s when that speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies against bullying, harassment, intimidation…

Congresswoman Stefanik:Does that speech not cross that barrier? Does that speech not call for the genocide of Jews and the elimination of Israel? You testified that you understand that that is the definition of “intifada.” Is that speech according to the Code of Conduct or not?

President Gay:We embrace a commitment to free expression and give a wide berth to free expression even of views that are objectionable, outrageous and offensive.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You and I both know that that is not the case. You are aware that Harvard ranked dead last when it came to free speech, are you not aware of that report?

President Gay:As I’ve observed earlier, I reject that characterization of our campus.

Congresswoman Stefanik:The data show’s it’s true and isn’t it true that Harvard previously rescinded multiple offers of admissions for applicants and accepted freshman for sharing offensive memes, racist statements, sometimes as young as 16-years-old. Did Harvard not rescind those offers of admission?

President Gay:That long predates my time as president so I can’t speak -

Congresswoman Stefanik:But you understand that Harvard made that decision to rescind those offers of admission.

President Gay:I have no reason to contradict the facts as you present them to me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Correct, because it’s a fact. You’re also aware that a Winthrop House faculty dean was let go over who he chose to legally represent. Correct? That was while you were dean.

President Gay:That is an incorrect characterization of what transpired.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What’s the characterization?

President Gay:I’m not going to get into details about a personnel matter.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Well let me ask you this: will admission offers be rescinded or any disciplinary action be taken against students or applicants who say, “from the river to the sea” or “intifada” advocating for the murder of Jews.

President Gay:As I’ve said, that type of hateful, reckless, offensive speech is personally abhorrent to me.

Congresswoman Stefanik:No action will be taken? What action will be taken?

President Gay:When speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies, including policies against bullying, harassment and intimidation, we take action. We have robust disciplinary processes that allow us to hold individuals accountable.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What action has been taken against students who are harassing and calling for the genocide of jews on Harvards campus?

President Gay:I can assure you, we have robust disciplinary actions.

Congresswoman Stefanik:What actions have been taken? I’m not asking, I’m asking what actions have been taken against those students.

President Gay:Given students rights to privacy and our obligations under FERPA. I will not say more about any specific cases other than to reiterate that processes are ongoing.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Do you know what the number one hate crime in America is?

President Gay:I know that over the last couple of months there has been an alarming rise of antisemitism which I understand is the critical topic that we are here to discuss.

Congresswoman Stefanik:That's correct. It is anti-Jewish hate crimes. And Harvard ranks the lowest when it comes to protecting Jewish students. This is why I have called for your resignation and your testimony today and not being able to answer with moral clarity speaks volumes.

Title: Stefanik Announces Launch of Initiative to Bring Physicians to Rural and Underserved Areas of Upstate New York and the North Country
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced that following her advocacy the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) launched its J-1 Visa Program in collaboration with New York, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to make quality healthcare accessible to rural America by easing the visa requirements for nondomestic physicians who trained in the U.S. if they agree to practice in underserved areas. NBRC will recommend the U.S. Department of Homeland Security waive what is known as the “two-year home-country physical presence requirement” for eligible physicians seeking to work at healthcare institutions and practices within the NBRC territory. This will help alleviate the physician workforce shortage disproportionately affecting rural America.

“Following my advocacy, the Northern Border Regional Commission will launch its J-1 Visa Program to help provide rural and underserved areas across Upstate New York and the North Country with accessible, quality, and affordable healthcare helping to alleviate the physician shortage I have been working tirelessly to address,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Last week, I heard directly from a NY-21 constituent in Copenhagen about how the physician shortage in her area was affecting her family’s access to healthcare, during my Medicare Telephone Town Hall. These physicians will provide critical medical services in rural areas of our states currently suffering from physician staffing shortages.”

“My thanks to the NBRC for launching this program and to Congresswoman Stefanik for her continued work to enhance access to health care in the North Country region. With her support, physicians trained in our country will find it easier to stay here and practice, and that’s great news as we continue to struggle with a chronic physician shortage,”said Michelle LeBeau, President of the Alice Hyde Medical Center and Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital.“The J-1 Visa Waiver Program is an important step in ensuring people living in some of the most rural areas of our country have access to quality health care. It aligns with our Network’s commitment to preserve and enhance health care services for the communities we serve and supports our efforts to attract and retain physicians so we can continue to deliver quality care to our patients. Everyone, regardless of where they live, should have access to quality care.”

“Recruiting and retaining physicians in rural communities – amid a protracted national shortage – is challenging, but essential for sustainability and equitable access to care. We applaud Rep. Stefanik for her advocacy and appreciate her work with the Northern Border Regional Commission on this new J-1 Visa Program,”said Aaron Kramer, President and CEO of Adirondack Health.

“Physician recruitment has always been a challenge in St. Lawrence County; however, with the passage of the new J-1 Visa Waiver Program, our hospitals will be better positioned to enhance patient access to the critical areas of primary and mental health; which continue to be underserved. I would like to thank Congresswoman Stefanik for her commitment to ensuring high quality healthcare to the Northern Border communities,”said Donna McGregor, St. Lawrence Health Regional President.

“The Northern Border Regional Commission’s (NBRC) launch of an improved J-1 Visa Program is welcome news, and will be instrumental in providing some relief to the ongoing provider shortage challenges we all face across the North Country. Whether you are part of a community health center, hospital system, or other healthcare organization, the frustration of not being able to provide care as quickly as possible because we simply do not have the number of providers available to meet demand, impacts all of us. This may not fix the problem overnight, but it will give healthcare systems more flexibility when bringing on additional providers for primary and behavioral healthcare services,”said Ray Babowicz, Director of Communications and Strategic Partnerships at the Community Health Center of the North Country.“I have spoken to Congresswoman Stefanik and her team many times over the past couple of years on this topic, and truly appreciate the follow through on making this not just a hope, but a reality. Healthcare providers across the 21st District, the communities we serve, and most importantly the patients reaching out to us for care, will all win from the program moving forward.”

In July 2022, Congresswoman Stefanikled her colleaguesin aletterspecifically calling on the NBRC to implement a J-1 visa waiver program that would allow nondomestic physicians trained in the U.S. to work in health professional shortage areas or medically underserved areas within the NBRC’s area of jurisdiction. In August 2022, Congresswoman Stefanikannouncedthat following this advocacy, the NBRC agreed to begin implementing a J-1 visa program in Fiscal Year 2023 to expand opportunities to recruit physicians to rural NY-21. In June 2023, Congresswoman Stefanik led abipartisan billto reauthorize the NBRC for ten years with an investment of $400M while making critical reforms to encourage economic development, enhance access to rural healthcare, and streamline bureaucratic processes within the NBRC.

During the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Hearing, Congresswoman Stefanik questioned Harvard President Claudine Gay on Harvard’s refusal to stop the rise of antisemitism on their campuses, Harvard receiving funds from foreign governments and entities, and President Gay’s failure to discipline perpetrators of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel harassment.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Harvard receives funding from foreign entities and governments which support its Middle East Studies Department. Correct?

President Gay:We receive funding from a variety of sources because we have alumni from all over the world.

Congresswoman Stefanik:But that is correct, right? The Middle Eastern Studies department.

President Gay:We receive funding from various sources.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It’s a yes or no. Are you not aware where the Middle Eastern Studies Department receives funding?

President Gay:We receive funding from various sources.

Congresswoman Stefanik:I am asking you a yes or no question. You are under oath in front of the United States Congress. You are giving lip service provided your attorneys. It's a yes or no question. Harvard receives funding from foreign entities and governments which support its Middle Eastern Studies Department. Correct?

President Gay:We have alumni all over the world, and we benefit from their philanthropy.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So the answer’s correct, yes, yes, the answer is correct?

President Gay:We receive support from alumni all over the world, from individuals.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And what amount of support is that reported to the federal government?

President Gay:I'd have to actually look at our filings.

Congresswoman Stefanik:You don’t know? As the President of the University, you don't know?

President Gay:Not that particular number.

Congresswoman Stefanik:It's 1.5 billion dollars over the past three years. Are you aware of that?

President Gay:I don't know if that is the correct number, but that's the number you've shared.

…

Congresswoman Stefanik:Thank you, Dr. Gay. According to the Hillel college guide, the Crimson freshman survey and even Harvard's own education next journal, the population of Jewish undergrads at Harvard has plummeted from roughly 25% in the 1980s to between five and 10%. Now, why is that?

President Gay:That is not data that we collect as part of the admissions process. So I can't speak to those numbers or to the trajectory.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So what is the percentage of students who are Jewish at Harvard in undergraduate now

President Gay:We do not collect religious affiliation as part of the admissions process.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Do you not rely on data collected by Harvard Hillel, which you visited for the first time after October 7? I'll just be honest with you. When I was a freshman, I enjoyed going to Harvard Hillel and had the opportunity to celebrate Shabbat dinners with my fellow undergrads. The fact that it took you until after October 7 to go to Harvard Hillel is unacceptable. Yield back

….

Congresswoman Stefanik:Dr. Gay did anyone contact you about flying the Israeli flag over Harvard Yard?

President Gay:Yes.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And the decision was made not to allow the flag to be flown over Harvard Yard.

President Gay:It's been standard protocol at the university for years to only fly the American flag unless we have a visiting dignitary.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So the decision was made to allow the Ukraine flag to be flown over Harvard Yard.

President Gay:That was a decision that was made by my predecessor, as an exception to a long standing rule.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Soit was an exception. So you made an exception for the Ukrainian flag, but not the, the university made an exception for the Ukrainian flag, but not the Israeli flag.

President Gay:That was a choice made by my predecessor.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Are you aware that there are stickers that are placed on Harvard University dining services food calling for Israeli apartheid? It says Warning. “Sabra funds, Israeli apartheid and the murder of Palestinians.” Is that acceptable?

President Gay:I can assure you that we have strong disciplinary processes when there are violations of our rules.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And this is a violation of the rules.

President Gay:I can't see that very clearly but.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Are you not aware of the stickers being placed on the food items provided to Harvard students?

President Gay:I do recall an episode like that.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And there are disciplinary actions ongoing?

President Gay:Given students privacy and FERPA which I'm sure you know, well. I will not say more about these particular cases other than to say that disciplinary processes are underway.

….

Congresswoman Stefanik:Dr. Gay, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules on bullying and harassment?

President Gay:The rules around bullying and harassment are quite specific. And if the context in which that language is used amounts to bullying and harassment then we take, we take action against it.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Can you say yes to that question of: does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules on bullying and harassment?

President Gay:Calling for the genocide of Jews is antisemitic.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So yes?

President Gay:And that is antisemitic speech, and as I’ve said.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And it’s a yes?

President Gay:When speech crosses into conduct, we take action.

Congresswoman Stefanik:So is that a yes? Is that a yes? The witness hasn't answered, Madam Chair. Is that a yes? You cannot answer the question.

President Gay:When speech crosses into conduct, we take action.

Title: Stefanik Leads Letter to Biden Administration Urging Investigation into Communist Chinese Drone Maker Autel
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party and bipartisan lawmakers in aletterurging the Biden administration to open investigations into Autel Robotics, a People's Republic of China (PRC) drone manufacturer.

The letter addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, explains that Autel Robotics maintains deep connections to the Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA). This poses a direct threat to U.S. national security as U.S. state and local governments operate Autel drones that could transmit sensitive data to the PLA. The lawmakers cite additional concerns regarding Autel's PRC state-backed subsidies, Autel's presence and technology potentially enabling genocide in Xinjiang, Autel drone components containing chips from blacklisted PRC companies ZTE and HiSilicon, and reports that Autel continues its operations in Russia under a pseudonym.

“Autel drones made in Communist China present an unacceptable national security risk and should not be allowed to operate in America. All Chinese companies, including Autel, must abide by Communist China’s foreign espionage laws and provide the Chinese Communist Party with data that their products collect. Chinese drones are now mapping American critical infrastructure giving Communist China detailed images of our energy grid, agricultural technology, and other critical infrastructure,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to join Chairman Gallagher in demanding that the Biden Administration conduct an investigation into Autel to fully assess the clear national security risks of allowing these drones to operate in America and to add Autel to export control lists so they are not able to benefit from American innovation and ingenuity. It is past time that we prohibit the use of Communist Chinese drones in America and I am proud to lead this effort.

Congresswoman Stefanik, Chairman Gallagher, and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi were joined byReps. Rob Wittman (R-VA), Andre Carson (D-IN), Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO), Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), John Moolenaar (R-MI), and Neal Dunn (R-FL) also signed the letter.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions Journalists on Federal Government’s Involvement in Social Media Censorship of the Hunter Biden Laptop Scandal
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik questioned journalists Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger about the federal government's involvement in social media censorship surrounding the Hunter Biden laptop scandal at a hearing by the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:It has been almost one year since the first bombshell Twitter Files. Looking back now, and my questions are for Mr. Taibbi and Mr. Shellenberger, what was the most alarming thing that you came across during your review of internal Twitter documents? And I have a number of follow up questions so keep it short.

Taibbi:Sure, thank you for the question. I think the most alarming thing we saw was the regular stream, organized stream of communication between the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the largest tech companies in the country. They had an organized system for flagging content, not occasionally but in enormous numbers involving spreadsheets of accounts that ran to the hundreds and thousands and this was shocking to us and to Congressman [Massie]’s point, this isn't a crazy conspiracy theory. We have already had four federal judges rule that they believe that this activity violates the First Amendment. This is quite serious. We didn’t know whether it was against the law, but we certainly thought it was shocking enough to be in the public interest. That for me was the most serious thing.

Shellenberger:For me it was seeing the so-called former FBI officials within Twitter and working with other groups including this Aspen Institute participate in an effort to so-call “pre-bunk” the Hunter Biden laptop before it was ever published in the New York Post and then to get it censored by Twitter in violation of Twitter’s own terms of service whose internal staff had concluded that the New York Post tweet had not violated their terms of service and they censored it anyway.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Shellenberger, I want to ask you further, that revolving door between the FBI and Twitter and I also want to ask about those third party essentially government proxies. You reference the Aspen Institute. Can you delve deeper into both of those questions, both of those topics?

Shellenberger:Sure. It was the former general counsel of the FBI, Jim Baker, and the Former Deputy Director of the FBI had both taken jobs at Twitter, there were so many FBI people at Twitter that they had their own internal group and their own little crib sheet to describe the difference between the terms they use at the FBI vs at Twitter. The CIA as well had their own little internal group. Sorry, what was the second question?

Congresswoman Stefanik:The third-party proxies like the Aspen Institute.

Shellenberger:Oh yeah, well then the Aspen Institute, this was the weirdest thing, we discovered the Aspen Institute created a workshop that was attended by basically all of the major media, as well as all of the major social media platforms, to basically pre-bunk in advance the Hunter Biden laptop even though there was no evidence that it existed outside of the fact that the FBI knew that they had it cause they got it in December 2019. So they have the Aspen Institute trying to persuade people not to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story in August and September of 2020 was quite chilling and disturbing to see.

Congresswoman Stefanik:These content moderators at social media platforms like Twitter wield an enormous amount of power in terms of determining not only what Americans can say but also what Americans can see. Do you believe, Mr. Taibbi and Mr. Shellenberger, that it's appropriate for unelected bureaucrats or these tech companies to collude to influence what Americans can say or read?

Shellenberger:Absolutely not. I wanted to stress again that all of this was happening secretively with the blessing of the Department of Homeland security with them sending things– this is from the EIP at Stanford to Twitter and Facebook saying “We repeat our recommendations that this account be suspended, we recommend labeling all instances of this article, we recommend you flag as false this.” All these demands being made, secretly without any public review. My view is that the government doesn’t decide who can speak in the town square, why should the government be deciding who can speak on social media platforms? We the people should decide our own content as adults, legal content, it should not be decided by either government or big tech.

Congresswoman Stefanik:And Mr. Taibbi and Mr. Shellenberger do you believe that this censorship is a form of election interference?

Shellenberger:Absolutely it is, there’s no question in my mind.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Mr. Taibbi?

Press Republican: In My Opinion: Rep. Stefanik on Medicare

Upstate New York and the North Country are home to one of the largest constituencies of older Americans in the nation. Over 21% of the population in New York’s 21st Congressional District are over the age of 65.

I am honored to represent over 160,000 seniors in Congress. Their valuable contributions are part of the fabric of our community, and I am committed to delivering the resources necessary to protect our elderly population — this includes protecting and preserving Medicare and Social Security.

I will always fight to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security so that our seniors receive the benefits they have worked so hard to earn over their lifetime.

One of my most rewarding duties as a Member of Congress is helping my constituents on an individual, case-by-case basis. That is why my top priority as the Representative for New York’s 21st Congressional District is to ensure that every citizen across the region has unparalleled access to high-quality constituent services.

Since having the honor of being elected to this office in 2015, I held thousands of in-district events, returned over $775,085,834 in tax-payer dollars to the district, and closed out over 14,637 open constituent casework requests.

One of my office’s most frequent constituent requests comes from our seniors asking about the benefits available to them during the Medicare Open Enrollment period. As you may know, the annual open enrollment period for Medicare began on Oct. 15, and runs through Dec. 7.

This period is the only time each year that you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan or Prescription Drug Plan, make any necessary changes to your current Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, or switch between original Medicare and Medicare Advantage Plans.

Choosing the Medicare Advantage plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that is right for you can be an overwhelming task which is why I am committed to offering support to our seniors in any way that I can.

Following through on that commitment, I am pleased to announce that today from 4:30 p.m. — 5:30 p.m., I will be hosting a live telephone town hall with an official from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Region 2 office to answer questions from those interested in participating in the Medicare Open Enrollment period.

The CMS representative will be available to help seniors with any specific policy questions and provide assistance so that they can choose the best plan for their unique situation while also offering counseling and information regarding benefits and plan options.

If you are unable to join the telephone town hall today from 4:30 p.m. — 5:30 p.m., but are eligible to receive Medicare benefits and have questions regarding your options during the Open Enrollment period, please do not hesitate to contact my office by visiting my website:Stefanik.house.gov.

You can also contact Medicare directly by calling toll free to 1-800-MEDICARE or by visiting their website atwww.medicare.gov.

As your Representative in Congress, I remain steadfast in my commitment to providing the best possible constituent services for our NY-21 families and seniors and will always fight on their behalf to protect and preserve their Medicare benefits.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: “The Biden Crime Family Sold Out America”
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and House Republican leadership held a press conference to discuss the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry into President Biden.

Chair Stefanik also highlighted the launch of theBiden impeachment inquiry websitewhich will provide Americans with transparency and allow them to see the clear corruption that Joe Biden and his family have committed.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“I wanted to begin with a quote from Thomas Jefferson who said, ‘The most sacred of the duties of government is to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.’

In pursuit of that sacred duty, House Republicans have worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people for months to deliver transparency, following the money and the facts to uncover what I believe will prove to be one of the largest political corruption scandals of our lifetime and potentially in our nation’s history. This impeachment inquiry, led by the Chairmen here today, Jamie Comer, Jim Jordan, and Jason Smith, continues to provide the American people the answers they both demand and deserve.

They have found over ten million dollars from China, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania funneled through the corrupt influence peddling schemes to line the pockets of the Biden Crime Family. The DOJ, FBI, and other federal agencies mobilized to play cover up and attack Biden’s leading political opponent, Donald Trump, in a desperate effort to distract from Joe Biden’s failings. And Joe Biden has lied continuously to the American people about how he was not only aware of, but was involved with, and financially benefited from his family’s corrupt influence peddling schemes.

Look around this room on these poster boards, the evidence is here. And unlike Joe Biden, the bank records do not lie. The Biden Crime Family sold out America, and the American people have had enough!

And while Extreme Democrats pursued a sham impeachment of Donald Trump, focused on baseless lies, driven by partisan politics, House Republicans have and will continue to follow the facts, uncovering more damning evidence each and every day.

This week, the House Republican Conference is unveiling an impeachment inquiry website, providing the public with a one-stop shop for updates from each of our committees and the evidence they are uncovering. It also includes a timeline which lays out exactly what the Biden Crime Family did to get us to this point.

Transparency is the hallmark of America. With each new fact we find, it becomes more clear that Joe Biden is compromised and unfit to lead.

I am honored to pass it over to our Chairmen who have worked so hard on their committees on behalf of the American people, and I’m going to start with our Oversight Chairman Jamie Comer.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik on the Bidens’ Influence Peddling Scheme: "This Is The Greatest Political Corruption Scandal Of Our Lifetime"
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik joinedMornings With Mariaon the Fox Business Network to discuss the impeachment inquiry into President Biden and discuss the evidence of vast corruption committed by Joe Biden and his family.

Watch her full interview here.

View highlights from her interview below.

On The Necessity For Hunter Biden’s Closed Door Deposition:

“Well, Maria, exactly what you said. In an open, public hearing, you see the Democrats turn this into a charade. It’s five minutes on each side, and it doesn't allow you to get to the facts in a deposed manner. A closed door hearing allows a legal definition. That is the only compliance with the Republican subpoena. It allows you to follow the facts, to ask follow up questions, and that is incredibly important when we’re doing this investigative work and part of this impeachment inquiry. And my colleague, Chairman Comer, is exactly correct, this is not about Hunter Biden, this is about Joe Biden and whether or not he is compromised. I believe he is fully compromised, and I believe that as we continue uncovering evidence, we will see that this is the greatest political corruption scandal of our lifetime. But that can only be found if we’re able to follow the evidence in a closed door deposition, and of course, we welcome an open hearing for the American people to see, but there has to be a closed door deposition with a long form interview with all of the witnesses. And I will point out, Maria, Democrats, when they were in the majority, they demanded that there be closed door depositions, and Jamie Raskin, who you quoted beforehand or the Reporter quote, said it was unacceptable for Steve Bannon to appear publicly and not comply with the deposition. So, now the shoe is on the other foot, and the Democrats want to wipe away their previous statements.”

…

“Absolutely, and look at the precedents as well. Democrats also demanded that Donald Trump Jr. appear, and he appeared before two closed door depositions and did the transcribed interviews. This is part of our Congressional Oversight and that’s going to be very important and the only compliance is appearing before that closed door deposition and we’re going to stand by that as House Republicans.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on USMCA Dairy Dispute Panel’s Failure to Enforce USMCA
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement after a U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) dispute panelissued a rulingallowing Canadian restrictions on U.S. dairy farmers’ market access to continue despite its obligations under USMCA.

“It is entirely unacceptable that the current Canadian dairy restrictions harming U.S. farmers are allowed to continue. Our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country work hard to provide delicious and nutritious products for our communities and deserve the market access they were promised under USMCA. This USMCA dispute panel’s decision allows the status quo to continue. This is untenable. I will continue to work to ensure that USMCA is enforced to allow fair market access for our dairy farmers,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

In May 2021, Stefanik sent aletterto United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai, encouraging USTR to fully enforce dairy provisions in USMCA. Following Stefanik’sadvocacy, USTR announced in January 2022 that the agency established a dispute settlement panel to consider Canada’s failure to comply with dairy tariff-rate quota (TRQ) provisions in USMCA. The January 2022 decision resulted from the creation of this panel. In March 2022, Stefanikcalledon USTR to reject Canada’s proposed changes to their dairy TRQs under USMCA.

Title: Stefanik Secures Result and Announces Approval of Alice Hyde Medical Center’s Critical Access Hospital Designation
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik announced today that following her years of advocacy, the University of Vermont Health Network’s Alice Hyde Medical Center of Malone, New York will receive a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Designation.

“I am proud to announce that following my advocacy, Alice Hyde Medical Center has been awarded a Critical Access Hospital designation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which will provide the medical center with a financial lifeline, giving them the necessary resources to continue meeting the needs of our community,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to deliver this critical result to ensure Franklin County and the surrounding regions will continue to receive quality care. I will always fight for rural hospitals in NY-21 so families in our rural communities have certainty in their access to lifesaving treatments and care.”

“Achieving Critical Access Hospital status is a vital piece of Alice Hyde’s path to financial and operational stability and sustainability. We greatly appreciate Congresswoman Stefanik’s strong support of our work these many months, as we pursued Critical Access accreditation – and her advocacy in support of rural healthcare organizations like Alice Hyde, as we seek new and innovative ways to address the challenges facing small community hospitals like ours,”said Alice Hyde Medical Center President Michelle LeBeau.

In May 2023, Congresswoman Stefanikwrote a letterto CMS in support of the University of Vermont Health Network’s Alice Hyde Medical Center of Malone receiving a CAH designation after becoming eligible as a direct result of Congresswoman Stefanik’s efforts.

Congresswoman Stefanik was one of the first Members of Congress to recognize the issue and has led the fight to protect and maintain CAH status eligibility for hospitals across the region. Following a 2015 CMS policy change that narrowed the eligibility criteria for hospitals to certify or recertify as a CAH, Congresswoman Stefanik introduced the bipartisanProtecting Rural Access to Care Actto protect this vital designation for hospitals across Upstate New York.

Following the introduction of her legislation and multiple phone calls andlettersfrom Congresswoman Stefanik to the administration urging them to update their misguided policy, CMS rightfully decided to reverse their disastrous policy that restricted CAH eligibility for hospitals in need.

The Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation provides hospitals enhanced reimbursement rates to keep essential healthcare services in rural communities. In New York’s 21st District, Lewis County General Hospital, Carthage Area Hospital, River Hospital, University of Vermont Health Network – Elizabethtown, Clifton-Fine Hospital, and Gouverneur Hospital maintain a CAH designation.

Title: Stefanik, Bost Introduce Bill to Prevent Scams Against our Veterans
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Mike Bost (R-IL) introduced theVeterans Scam and Fraud Evasion (VSAFE) Actto prevent our veterans from falling victim to fraudulent attacks that endanger them and their livelihoods.

“I am proud to introduce the Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Act to establish a Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Officer in the Department of Veterans Affairs, addressing concerns of our veterans and their families in Upstate New York and across America by streamlining fraud prevention efforts within the Department of Veterans Affairs,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This bill will provide our veterans with consistent guidance on identifying, reporting, and avoiding fraud and scam attempts. Our veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our country and my duty in Congress is to bring their concerns to the highest levels of government.”

“VA must do everything they can to protect veterans’ hard-earned benefits from fraudsters and scammers because unfortunately, the bad guys still exist. Which is why I’m so grateful to my friend and colleague, Chairwoman Stefanik, for leading the Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Act of 2023. This commonsense proposal would build on VA’s efforts to enhance their cybersecurity, fraud, and scam protection efforts into one centralized place to protect veterans and keep pace with today’s digital world. I look forward to considering this important bill in Committee soon,”said Chairman Mike Bost.

TheFederal Trade Commission estimatedthat there were over 70,000 reports of fraud against veterans in 2022 alone. There are many groups working in a disjointed manner to combat fraud within the VA and other federal agencies. This legislation will enable a comprehensive effort that will greatly benefit our veterans by establishing a Veterans Scam and Fraud Evasion Officer in the Department of Veterans Affairs who is responsible for all fraud prevention efforts. This will provide our veterans with consistent guidance on how to identify, report, and avoid fraud and scam attempts.

Additionally, this bill promotes identity theft resources, calls on the VA to develop training plans to effectively field fraud and scam inquiries, and enables coordination with other federal departments, agencies, and Veteran Service Officers for a whole-of-government approach to fraud prevention.

Title: Stefanik, Cotton Introduce Legislation to Sanction Iranian Missile Development
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik introduced theNo ICBMs or Drones for Iran Actto strengthen sanctions on Iran’s development and transfer of long-range missiles and drones following the Biden Administration’s failure to renew United Nations sanctions restricting missile development in Iran after their expiration in October.

Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) is introducing the Senate companion in the Senate.

“Iran is advancing their pursuit of intercontinental ballistic missiles, arming Hamas and Russia to the teeth with kamikaze drones, and providing its terrorist proxies with weapons that are being used to strike American forces in the Middle East. This must stop,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to join Senator Cotton in leading the No ICBMs or Drones for Iran Act to strengthen sanctions on Iran’s missile and drone programs. Iran’s backing of Hamas and their continuous strikes on U.S. forces make it clear that our current sanctions are not working. To start successfully deterring Iran, we must enhance and enforce sanctions on Tehran and begin investing in our homeland missile defense architecture through the construction of a third missile defense site at Fort Drum.”

“The Biden administration seems content not to do anything to stop Iranian proxies from attacking American troops. But what will we do when Iran gets its hands on missiles that can reach America? This legislation is necessary to strengthen sanctions on Iran’s missile program to protect America and our allies,”said Senator Tom Cotton.

Specifically, theNo ICBMs or Drones for Iran Actwould:

Title: Stefanik Statement on Mayor Eric Adams Decision to Prioritize Illegal Immigrants Over New Yorkers
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement in response to New York City Mayor Eric Adams' outrageous announcement that his administration would be freezing police hires, closing public libraries, and slashing the city’s education budget by $1 billion over two years due to budget constraints caused by the city’s mismanagement of the Democrat-led illegal immigration crisis.

“We are seeing in real time the effects of extreme Far Left Democrat failed policies in New York City,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Eric Adams is declaring loud and clear that American families come last when Democrats are in charge. In the midst of an unprecedented crime and border crisis in New York City, Eric Adams is choosing to slash the number of law enforcement officers to below 30,000 endangering American lives. Joe Biden, Kathy Hochul, and Eric Adams are responsible for incentivizing the raging illegal immigration crisis and now families across New York are paying the price. New York is not safe with Far Left Joe Biden, Kathy Hochul, and Eric Adams at the helm.”

On Thursday, Mayor Eric Adams announced that his administration would be making cuts across city agencies as it struggles to foot the rising costs of the illegal immigration crisis plaguing New York. New York Governor Kathy Hochul welcomed asylum seekers with open arms andpledged to house them in 2021. Over 110,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since the spring of 2022 with over 10,000 arriving every month.

Title: Stefanik And Turner Send Criminal Referral to DOJ Demanding Immediate Investigation of Michael Cohen For Perjury & Knowingly Making False Statements While Testifying Under Oath
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Chairwoman Elise Stefanik led acriminal referralalong with House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH), demanding that Attorney General Merrick Garland immediately launch a criminal investigation into whether Michael D. Cohen committed perjury and knowingly making false statements while testifying under oath during his deposition before Congress on February 28, 2019.

“The Biden Justice Department must take off its partisan blinders and investigate disgraced fraudster and disbarred attorney Michael Cohen, a felon previously convicted for lying to Congress, who just admitted to lying again to Congress,”stated Chairwoman Stefanik.

Thecriminal referral states:“We write to refer compelling evidence that Michael D. Cohen appears to have committed perjury and knowingly made false statements while testifying under oath during his deposition before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (“Committee”) on February 28, 2019. Specifically, on October 25, 2023, while testifying in the trial People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump et al., No. 452564/2022 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.), Mr. Cohen admitted that the testimony he gave before the Committee in 2019 was knowingly and intentionally false.”

Thecriminal referral continues:“Mr. Cohen’s testimony at the New York trial is inconsistent with his testimony before the Committee. That Mr. Cohen was willing to openly and brazenly state at trial that he lied to Congress on this specific issue is startling. His willingness to make such a statement alone should necessitate an investigation. In sum, Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on February 28, 2019 is contradicted by his reported recent testimony on October 25, 2023. Mr. Cohen’s prior conviction for lying to Congress merits a heightened suspicion that he has yet again testified falsely before Congress. We therefore request that the Department investigate whether any of Mr. Cohen’s testimony warrants another charge for the violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 or 1621.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Blasts Her Alma Mater Harvard For Its Role In The Spread Of Antisemitism Across America
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik highlighted the abhorrent rise in antisemitism on college campuses across America, including her alma mater, Harvard University, following the barbaric Hamas terrorists in Israel during today's Education and Workforce Committee hearing.

Highlights from the questioning include:

Stefanik:Hamas’s barbaric terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli civilians on October 7th shocked the conscience of the free world. And in fact, this morning, we began with a viewing working with the Israeli embassy of the horrific, heinous atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists against Jewish civilians, babies, the elderly, young people at a festival, innocent civilians. These were atrocities. These were met, unfortunately, with callous cruelty at universities across America, including at my alma mater, Harvard University. Instead of leading with moral clarity and condemning Hamas’s terrorist attacks, university administrators at Harvard and other institutions failed their students through enabling the promulgation of horrific antisemitism which has now evolved into violent attacks against Israeli and Jewish students.

As the world watched in horror after October 7th, over thirty radical student organizations at Harvard released a joint statement outrageously claiming that Israel was entirely responsible for the Hamas terrorist attacks carried out against innocent Israeli civilians. Unfortunately, following this statement, Harvard leadership remained silent for two days allowing their silence to create a vacuum that was filled by the voices of repugnant actions of the antisemitic student organizations.

My question, and I’ll begin with Mr. Marcus, what role should university leaders play in condemning clearly and explicitly antisemitic statements like the one that the Harvard student organizations posted after October 7th and what actions should administrators take to root out antisemitism on campuses across America?

Kenneth Marcus, Founder and Chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law: At a minimum they should condemn anti-Jewish harassment with the same vigor as they do other forms of discrimination and we're not seeing that at Harvard or in other places. But beyond that, when you see 30 student groups who are celebrating atrocities like that, you need to have tough conversations throughout your university about what you are doing to harbor this. At Harvard University, we, on behalf of three clients, had found discriminatory conduct which the university agreed was a violation of their own policies. And we're not seeing significant responses to that. When administrators fail to address acknowledged antisemitic activity, they should not be surprised when it gets even worse.

Stefanik: My follow up, Mr. Marcus, is how have you seen the curriculum at American institutions of higher education shaped to foster these environments where hatred has been cultivated among the student body, and specifically curriculum that calls for the eradication of the State of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish people?

Marcus: Let me give you just one example and that's Middle East Studies programs that are funded under Title VI of the Higher Education Act by the Congress of the United States. There is now legislation on the books that requires Middle East Studies programs to certify that there will be a balance of perspectives and a diversity of views. And yet what if anything is done to ensure that's happening? I would certainly like to see scoring of the applications. I would like to see some follow up. I would like to see action when institutions fail to honor the commitments that they are making, in writing, to the U.S. government.

Stefanik: I want to submit for the record, Mr. Chair, the letter dated October 13 of Republican members of the House and Senate who are also graduates of Harvard University, I was proud to lead this letter condemning the failure of the administration to speak out explicitly and clearly. I've called for the resignation of President Claudine Gay and we will continue standing up with moral clarity that is so very much needed on college campuses in this country and around the world, and I yield back.

Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed in MyLittleFalls commemorating the passage of her bill theAmerican Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Actwhich helps update and preserve battlefields like Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Ann in NY-21.

Read Rep. Stefanik’s full op-ed below.

MyLittleFalls: Protecting Our Battlefields for Future Generations

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

“New York’s 21st District is the cradle of the American Revolution – home to Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Ann, Battle of Johnstown, Crown Point, and the Bennington Battlefield. Our region is home to the renowned Battles of Saratoga that turned the tide of the Revolutionary War in America’s favor. Families across Upstate New York and the North Country are incredibly proud of this deep military history that birthed our great nation.

I grew up going to these historic sites and for years have led the charge to preserve our historic battlefields in Congress as the Co-Chair of the Congressional Battlefield Caucus. It’s critical that we preserve and honor the places where Americans gave their last full measure of devotion in order to ensure future generations of Americans learn the lessons of their sacrifices on these hallowed grounds.

Protecting our nation’s battlefields is essential for creating rich, educational programming and experiences for students and visitors. That is why I introduced the American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act to ensure that these foundational lands are preserved for generations to come. I led this bipartisan legislation with my Congressional Battlefield Caucus Co-Chair Mr. Connolly of Virginia to preserve and improve the American Battlefield Protection Program, one of the most successful land preservation programs managed by the National Park Service. Since its conception, the American Battlefield Protection Program has helped protect more than 100 battlefields in 42 states, including Fort Ann and Sackets Harbor in our region. I am proud that this important bill passed the House recently with bipartisan support.

The American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act will continue to ensure our many battlefields are properly maintained by improving and streamlining the American Battlefield Protection Program, making critical modifications to strengthen the program for years to come. My bill will also allow non-profits and tribes to apply to the program directly instead of having to go through a government sponsor. Removing this burdensome hurdle cuts through bureaucracy, allowing these entities to be more efficient in preserving our endangered battlefields.

Additionally, my legislation will clarify the eligibility of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 sites for Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants to ensure the program is used to preserve battlefield land while also creating a process for the National Park Service to expand and update battlefield boundaries.

With modern research, archaeology, and emerging technologies, the historical boundaries of various battlefields have shifted. Without the program improvements in my bill, portions of battlefields with newly discovered historic importance stand to be lost. We must not allow this to happen and instead, strive to ensure these critical pieces of our history are preserved for future generations.

This past July, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands held a legislative hearing on my bill. I was honored to invite Beth Hill, President and CEO of the Fort Ticonderoga Association to testify on the benefits of the legislation and the great work they are doing at Fort Ticonderoga.

I am grateful to work on behalf of the people of Upstate New York and the North Country. We represent the heart of America: hardworking, patriotic believers in our nation’s exceptionalism and our God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Our home is steeped in rich military history and its preservation is one of my top priorities. This week, I am so proud that my bill the American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act passed the House of Representatives unanimously and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this legislation signed into law to ensure our most hallowed grounds are preserved for future generations.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik OpEd in Watertown Daily Times: Stefanik: Show appreciation to veterans this month, and always

Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed in Watertown Daily Times in observance of Veterans Day and in honor of Military Families Month.

Read Rep. Stefanik’s full op-ed below.

Watertown Daily Times: Stefanik: Show appreciation to veterans this month, and always

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

“As we observe Veterans Day and honor Military Families Month, it is important for every American to take a moment to show our appreciation to the brave veterans who have served in the military and their families. Our Servicemembers who defend our nation are only able to do so because of the selfless service their families perform every day. Too often, military spouses and families face the extreme burdens of managing their households alone while their Servicemember is called away to serve. This is why I am a proud supporter of our military families and continuously advocate on their behalf in the House of Representatives.

I have the distinct honor and privilege of representing Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed division since 9/11. Those deployments, and the critical training between them, take soldiers away from their families for extensive periods of time. During these times, spouses and other dependents are faced with unique challenges that place a heavy burden on them.

The difficulties that Servicemembers face while balancing the needs of their demanding profession and the needs of their family are vast. Since my first year in Congress, I have introduced and advanced numerous bills to ease the burdens on our military families.

Childcare is a daily concern for many families, and it is paramount that these military families not only have immediate availability, but also quality options for childcare. Servicemembers rely on Child Development Centers while they are on duty to take care of their children. In this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I secured language that aims to retain quality workers at these centers, enhancing employment at these facilities, to ensure ample availability for our Servicemembers’ children.

While Child Development Centers are critical, military families deserve to have options to choose what type of childcare best suits their families. To ensure these families have this choice, I worked to include an expansion of the Department of Defense’s In-Home Child Care pilot program to Fort Drum. This program aids military families by allowing them to have full-time childcare options to meet their specific needs.

When relocating, military spouses and families oftentimes face employment and financial challenges. One of the greatest financial burdens that can impact them is their student loans. This Congress, I have introduced legislation that would defer student loans for certain military spouses for up to 180 days. This gives families more time to get situated at their new duty location and provides flexibility in their finances to stay current on repayments.

Maintaining financial stability is increasingly challenging in today's economy. Ensuring our Servicemembers are compensated fairly is crucial for a high quality of life. I am proud to have secured a 5.2% increase in basic pay for Servicemembers in this year's NDAA. This is the largest pay raise in over two decades and will greatly benefit military families.

Finally, we must not forget to honor and support our military families that have suffered the loss of a Servicemember. Surviving spouses must navigate through incredibly difficult circumstances when dealing with the devastating loss of their loved ones; brave Servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country. Unfortunately, they are penalized financially if they remarry and work to rebuild their lives before a certain age. In recognition of not only the Servicemembers' ultimate sacrifice by the surviving family’s sacrifice as well, I have introduced legislation that would restore non-monetary benefits to these surviving spouses, such as access to on-base commissaries and morale, welfare, and recreation programs.

I will continue to advocate for our Servicemembers through the Committee on Armed Services and introduce common-sense legislation that ensures the 10th Mountain Division and military families everywhere have the best resources available and are supported to the best of our ability. This National Veterans and Military Families Month, which is highlighted by Veterans Day, I am thankful to the courageous men and women that serve our country, and for their families that endure so much as the backbone of our military community.”

Title: Stefanik Demands the Biden Administration Prohibit Adversarial Access to Nuclear Test Sites
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletterto U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm demanding that the Department of Energy (DOE) prohibit our adversaries from accessing our sensitive nuclear tests following reports that Secretary Granholm invited officials from Communist China and Russia to observe sensitive nuclear tests in Nevada.

In September at the International Atomic Energy Agencymeeting, a senior DOE official invited Chinese and Russian officials to observe sensitive U.S. weapons-related tests. This comes at a time when Communist China is growing its capabilities at an alarming rate and is projected to have over1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030and Russia is using nuclear saber-rattling to exert pressure on the international community.

In the letter, the lawmaker states,“The Biden Administration’s willingness to allow our strategic rivals this unprecedented access to our sensitive nuclear testing will only embolden their efforts to increase their offensive capabilities. Once again, the Biden Administration is rewarding our adversaries with access to our sensitive nuclear technology while not demanding anything in return. Giving our adversaries unfettered access to our nuclear testing will only work to undermine our interests and worsen the international destabilization we are facing because of the Biden Administration’s weakness on the world stage.”

“I am leading my colleagues in demanding that President Biden revoke this misguided invitation to our adversaries in Beijing and Moscow that grants them unprecedented access and insight into our nuclear weapons,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Inviting Communist China and Russia to have a front row seat for our sensitive nuclear weapons tests will give them invaluable information on how to defeat our nuclear capabilities and improve their own. At a time when our adversaries are growing their nuclear stockpiles to undermine America’s leadership allowing them access to one of our nuclear test sites will only advance this pursuit and lead to our own destruction."

"Our National Labs perform critical national security activities that are bedrock of our defense,”said Congressman Doug Lamborn. “They oversee the stewardship of our national stockpile which maintains our safe, secure, credible, and effective nuclear deterrent force. Allowing adversaries to observe our nuclear testing activities allows them to derive our methods and procedures and this destroys deterrence. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, one of my priorities has been to strengthen and protect our nuclear arsenal. In the world today, nothing could jeopardize our national security more than losing this advantage,”continued Congressman Lamborn.“I was stunned to hear recent reports of Biden administration officials inviting citizens from our two greatest adversaries to observe U.S. nuclear weapons tests. Russia and China should not have insider access to our testing. Both countries have had ample opportunity to be more open about their nuclear weapons development and deployments and refuse to do so. The amendment I introduced on this matter will halt the Biden administration's latest lapse in judgment."

“The notion of granting America’s adversaries access to our military sites— and enabling them to gain information about U.S. nuclear capabilities— is deeply alarming and fundamentally absurd,”said Rep. Rob Wittman. “I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding the Biden administration explain why they are inviting Russian and Chinese Communist Party officials to access our most sensitive laboratories and testing facilities.”

Stefanik is joined by Representatives Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Joe Wilson (R-SC), James Moylan (R-Guam), Rob Wittman (R-VA), Bill Posey (R-FL), Pat Fallon (R-TX), Chris Smith (R-NJ), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), Scott DesJarlais, M.D. (R-TN), John Moolenaar (R-MI), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Dale W.

Title: Stefanik Votes to Advance DETERRENT Act to the Floor
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her colleagues from the Committee on Education and the Workforce voted to send theDefending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions (DETERRENT) Actto the floor. This legislation brings necessary oversight and transparency to foreign gift reporting requirements to help colleges and universities across the country counter foreign influence and protect our nation’s students.

This bill also includes theHalting Academic Liaisons To (HALT) our Adversaries Actwhich Congresswoman Stefanik introduced earlier this year to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not contribute to the advancement of the militaries of Communist China or the Russian Federation.

“I am committed to ensuring that our institutions of higher education are not compromised by foreign adversaries that want to see the demise of our great nation,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “President Biden has allowed foreign adversaries to run rampant and undermine our nation’s interests through our universities. We must ensure that universities are putting the interest of American students first and not allowing foreign actors such as Communist China to push propaganda and steal our research. We must protect our students and stand strong against our adversaries.”

TheDETERRENT Act:

1. Slashes the foreign gift reporting threshold for colleges and universities from $250,000 down to $50,000, with an even stricter $0 threshold for countries of concern.

2. Closes reporting loopholes and provides transparency to Congress, intelligence agencies, and the public.

3. Requires disclosure of foreign gifts to individual staff and faculty at research-heavy institutions to protect those targeted the most by our adversaries.

4. Holds our largest private institutions accountable for their financial partnerships by revealing concerning foreign investments in their endowments.

5. Implements a series of repercussions for colleges and universities that remain noncompliant in foreign gift reporting such as fines and the loss of Title IV funding.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Joins Families of Hostages Held by Hamas Demanding Action
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and House Republican leadership held a press conference with families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the barbaric terrorist attacks on October 7th. House Republicans stand with the Jewish community, our great ally Israel, and will do everything in their power to ensure Israel has the resources to defend itself and return every last hostage to their family.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Today, the House Republican Conference is joined by the families of four of the over 200 hostages taken by barbaric, Hamas terrorists on October 7th. As a mother, sister, and daughter, my heart breaks for the unspeakable pain they are enduring every second of every day. On this issue of standing with Israel and these families, there can be no moral equivocation. As Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu stated last week this war is ‘between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. It is a time for everyone to decide where they stand.’

Horrifically, the Jewish people have suffered their bloodiest days since the Holocaust with acts of inhumane evil committed by Hamas terrorists backed by Iran. In fact, this week marks 85 years since Kristallnacht (kri-stuhl-naakt). The pogroms unleashed during the Night of Broken Glass and the aftermath they wrought shocked the conscience of the globe and led then U.S. President FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to proclaim, ‘I myself could scarcely believe that such things could occur in a twentieth-century civilization.’

The unspeakable atrocities of today have been met by some with callous cruelty in our own twenty-first century United States. Posters of innocent victims have been ripped down. American universities failing to protect their Jewish students from intimidation, harassment, and violence, and just yesterday, an elderly, Jewish man in Los Angeles was beaten to death by a pro-Palestine protestor.

Hear this loudly and clearly, House Republicans stand with these families next to us. We stand with the Jewish community, and we stand like a rock, as our Speaker said, with our most precious ally Israel. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Israel has the resources to return every last hostage to their family from these Hamas terrorists. With that, I am honored to introduce our Speaker of the House - a great friend of Israel - Speaker Mike Johnson.”

Title: Stefanik Demands Answers from Secretary Buttigieg Over Conversion of Nation's Airports Into Housing for Illegal Immigrants
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletteralong with Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO), Subcommittee Chairman Garret Graves (R-LA), and Congressman Anthony D’Esposito (R-NY) demanding answers from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on reports that the federal government is encouraging the use of American airports as temporary shelters for illegal immigrants.

The letter states:“The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed housing 60,000 migrants at four public airports and various other facilities in New York and New Jersey. These airports and their communities rightfully fear being transformed into larger versions of Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which has reportedly converted portions of its terminal into a shelter for hundreds of migrants. At a time when the Administration is proposing higher screening requirements on known airline crewmembers due to security risks, we are extremely concerned about the lack of regard for security risks posed by housing thousands of unknown persons at airports, many of which support passenger air service and host sensitive military facilities.”

The letter continues:“Airports are generally required to request permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before using aeronautical land and facilities for nonaeronautical purposes, like the housing of migrants, on an interim basis. These provisions prevent governments, including the Federal Government, from abusing taxpayer investment in aeronautical facilities and commandeering them at below-market rates for nonaeronautical and incompatible purposes. It is your responsibility to direct the FAA to reject any attempt by a Federal, state, or local agency to use airport facilities for such a nonaeronautical and incompatible purpose as housing migrants.”

“I am demanding that Transportation Secretary Buttigieg direct the FAA to immediately stop any attempts to house illegal immigrants at our public airports and other facilities. The Biden Administration instead should focus on working with House Republicans to secure our Northern and Southern Borders,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This is not the first time that the Biden Administration and Extreme Democrats have irresponsibly spent taxpayer dollars altering public spaces to deal with the effects of their Far Left open border policies, jeopardizing the safety of our communities. Just this August, I fought against Massena International Airport being converted into a housing site, turning Upstate and North Country into a surrogate ‘Sanctuary City'. American airports are not camps for illegal immigrants and I will continue to do all in my power to fight Joe Biden’s open border policies and keep NY-21 safe.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on Fort Drum Soldiers Injured After Attacks by Iranian-Backed Terrorists
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released a statement on the multiple Iranian-backed terrorist attacks that injured over 40 U.S. Servicemembers including multiple 10th Mountain Division soldiers in Iraq and Syria. Twenty-five hundred soldiers from 10th MTN’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team are currently deployed to Iraq and Syria in support of the Combined Joint Task Force: Operation Inherent Resolve.

“Since October 17, Iranian-backed proxies have carried out 38 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria resulting in the injuries of over 40 US Servicemembers, including multiple 10th MTN Division Soldiers. In response to the 38 attacks directed at US forces, the Biden Administration has carried out only two strikes against facilities in Syria,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Joe Biden’s complete failure to appropriately respond to these recurrent attacks invites additional aggression from our adversaries. These Iranian-backed rocket and drone attacks are intended to kill American forces and if the Biden Administration continues to allow them to strike US troops without repercussion, our men and women in uniform will be put in further danger. The Biden Administration's current abysmal deterrence strategy is failing. Attacking US forces should be a costly red line that none of our adversaries are willing to cross. As the representative for Fort Drum and the 10th MTN Division, I am demanding that the Biden Administration pursue peace through strength, stand with Israel, and protect American forces.”

Title: Stefanik-Led American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act Passes on the House Floor
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik’s bill theAmerican Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Actco-led with Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA) passed on the House Floor. This bipartisan legislation makes improvements to the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) which helps update and preserve battlefields like Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Ann in NY-21.

“I am proud to see my legislation pass the House today with bipartisan support. New York’s 21st Congressional District is the cradle of the American Revolution and home to Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Ann, and the Bennington Battlefield. It is as much our patriotic duty to preserve these lands as it is to defend the freedoms and liberty earned on these fields,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“As co-chair of the Congressional Battlefield Caucus, I will always prioritize the preservation of the battlefields found in Upstate New York, the North Country, and throughout our nation.”

“As co-chair of the American Battlefields Caucus, I was proud to join Rep. Stefanik to introduce this important legislation and I am thrilled to see it pass the House today,”said Congressman Gerry Connolly.“This bill builds on the hugely successful American Battlefield Protection Program and will allow us to better protect the history and legacy of battlefields in Virginia and across the country.”

“Protecting our historical battlegrounds is essential to honoring those who perished on these hallowed grounds and remembering the importance of these sites in our history,"said House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman."H.R. 3448 is a commonsense piece of legislation that will conserve pieces of our history and give Americans opportunities to both honor and learn about consequential events in our country’s storied history for generations. I thank Representative Stefanik for introducing this bill and working with me to pass it through the committee and House. I hope to see it signed into law soon.”

"As we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation's founding, we must seek out fitting ways to mark those events,"said American Battlefield Trust President David Duncan."Amid all the ways that communities will remember, battlefield preservation is uniquely fitting because it will last long beyond this anniversary and long beyond our own lifetimes. When our children and grandchildren gather to mark the tricentennial, they will be able to do so more readily because of places set aside, restored and interpreted thanks to the efficiencies created in the American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act."

“Fort Ticonderoga is proud to support the American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act and applauds Congresswoman Stefanik for her leadership in supporting important historic preservation programs,”stated Beth L. Hill, Fort Ticonderoga President and CEO.“The American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act will ensure that this grant program is nimble and successful, maximizing its potential as a critical means of battlefield preservation. As our nation approaches our national 250th commemoration of the American Revolution, we must take this opportunity to expand resources, mobilize partnerships, and ensure that our nation’s hallowed grounds are preserved for posterity.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Speaks on House Floor on Her American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act
Date: 2023

Content:
View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“I rise today in support of my legislation the American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act and I want to take the time to thank our Chairman Bruce Westerman and the Ranking Member for their support throughout this process both in committee but also visiting with so many communities that understand the importance of preserving and protecting these most hallowed grounds.

I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my Congressional Battlefield Caucus Co-Chair, Mr. Connolly of Virginia, to preserve and improve the American Battlefield Protection Program, one of the most successful land preservation programs managed by the National Park Service. Since its conception, the American Battlefield Protection Program has helped protect more than 100 battlefields in 42 states, including Fort Ann in my district in Upstate New York.

New York’s 21st District is truly the cradle of the American Revolution, home to Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Ann, and the Bennington Battlefield. But as people across Upstate New York and the North Country will proudly tell you, our deep military history extends beyond the Revolution and incorporates many important battlefields from the French and Indian War through the War of 1812.

I, myself, I grew up going to these historic sites and I have considered them part of the classroom of my childhood education and for years, I have been proud to lead the charge to preserve these historic battlefields in Congress as the Co-Chair of the Congressional Battlefield Caucus. It’s critical that we preserve and honor the places Americans gave their last full measure of devotion in order to ensure future generations of Americans learn the lessons of those sacrifices on these very hallowed grounds.

This bill also allows non-profits and tribes to apply to the program directly, instead of having to go through a government sponsor. Removing this burdensome hurdle cuts through bureaucracy, allowing these entities to be more efficient and effective in preserving our endangered battlefields.

This legislation also clarifies the eligibility of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 sites for Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants to ensure the program is used to preserve battlefield land, while also creating a process for the National Park Service to expand and update battlefield boundaries.

With emerging archaeological technologies, historical boundaries of various battlefields have shifted as we learn more. Without the program improvements in my bill, portions of battlefields with newly discovered historic importance stand to be lost. We must not allow this to happen, and instead strive to ensure these critical pieces of our history, our most hallowed history, are preserved for future generations.

I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the bipartisan American Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act to ensure these battlefields continue to be preserved for years and generations to come.”

Title: Stefanik-Supported Bill, the Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) Act, Passes on the House Floor To Sanction Iranian Oil
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik supported the passage of theStop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) Acton the House Floor to impose and mandate the enforcement of sanctions on Iranian oil to cut off funding for its destabilizing activities in the region.

This legislation establishes heavy sanctions to deny Iran the funds that it has been using to further its nuclear capabilities, support terrorist proxies around the Middle East, and openly oppress the Iranian people. This legislation sanctions foreign ports which knowingly accept shipments of Iranian petroleum products, refineries that process petroleum originating from Iran, and any parties that transport, offload or otherwise deal with Iranian petroleum including ship to ship transfers. These sanctions include asset freezes and visa bans. The bill also requires the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration to issue an annual report to Congress on Iran’s growing exports of petroleum and their trade with China.

“The Biden Administration continues to pander to Tehran through lax enforcement of oil sanctions and the unfreezing of billions in assets,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Since Joe Biden stepped into the Oval Office, Iran has made around $80 billion from illicit oil sales. This steady stream of oil revenue provides significant resources for Iran to advance its nuclear program, support terrorism, and brutally oppress the Iranian people. The SHIPS Act is a crucial step in reversing the Biden Administration’s strategy of appeasement to ensure Tehran does not have the resources to continue funding Hamas’s barbaric attack on Israel.”

Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the milk carton shortage that is straining NY-21 schools and potentially threatening school children’s access to nutritious milk essential for their healthy development.

“I am deeply concerned about the milk carton shortage that threatens to remove our children’s access at school to nutritious milk essential for their healthy development. Our dairy farmers in Upstate New York and the North Country work hard to produce nutritious dairy products so that our children can access these essential nutrients for their development. The health benefits from diets that include milk are undeniable which is why I cosponsored the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, legislation that would expand access to whole milk options in schools,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “I applaud our Upstate schools that have quickly adapted to serving our students by purchasing milk by the gallon to serve individually to ensure our kids have uninterrupted access to a proper nutritious meal as this milk carton shortage persists.”

This year, Congresswoman StefanikcosponsoredtheWhole Milk for Healthy Kids Actto allow schools to serve flavored and unflavored whole milk. It passed out of the Education and Workforce Committee earlier this summer.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik on Standing with Israel & Combating Antisemitism at Harvard
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox and Friends to discuss how House Republicans are committed to standing like a rock with our great ally Israel and providing the resources necessary for Israel to defend itself against the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists.

Stefanik also discussed her efforts to end antisemitism on college campuses and why she voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for parroting Hamas talking points.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights from her interview are below:

On Standing Strong With Our Great Ally Israel:

“Shame on Joe Biden and shame on Chuck Schumer. House Republicans understand how important it is to stand strongly with Israel, and it is the White House and the Democrat Senate that are politicizing this issue. House Republicans are committed to passing this 14 billion dollar aid package to make sure that we’re supporting Iron Dome and getting the resources we need to Israel at a time of their greatest need, at a time when they faced a terrorist attack from Hamas backed by Iran. Full stop. So the fact that this White House is trying to politicize this issue, House Republicans will stand like a rock as our newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson said, and we will get this done.”

On Funding to Ukraine:

“That's not going to be tied into this bill. We think that is a very politicized issue. The White House has not answered questions as to: how those dollars are going to be spent, what is the ultimate goal when it comes to Ukraine, the White House has not answered those questions. When it comes to Israel, though, our most precious ally in the Middle East, we need to make sure that we're standing strongly and that people are going to have to make a decision. And boy, is it going to expose Democrats who vote no on this very straightforward package to support Israel.”

On Voting To Censure Rashida Tlaib:

“Well, I voted to censure Rashida Tlaib. She has been mimicking and parroting Hamas talking points. She refuses to correct her misinformation and terrorist propaganda, blaming Israel for the explosion at the hospital when that was Hamas. That was a Hamas rocket that exploded at a hospital in Gaza. She has failed to take that down. She should be censured. I voted to censure her, the vast majority of Republicans did so. And every Republican is going to have to defend their vote to their constituents.”

On Antisemitism At Harvard:

“It is inexcusable, and Harvard University has totally failed in terms of condemning the significant rise of antisemitism. That's why I lead with my colleagues in the House, who are also Harvard graduates, ranging from Ted Cruz to newly elected House member Kevin Kiley, strongly condemning President Claudine Gay that's the president of Harvard's handling of this. She put a task force in place, the students should be expelled who are not only going after Jewish students, but also saying these heinous, horrific antisemitic comments. So shame on Harvard and all of these institutions for not taking a strong stance on this. We will put on the floor a resolution condemning antisemitism on college campuses, another area where Republicans will lead.”

Title: House Passes Stefanik, Owens' Resolution Condemning Antisemitism and Support for Terrorist Organizations on American College Campuses
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Today, a resolution led by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Burgess Owens (R-UT) passed on the House Floor.H.Res.798strongly condemns the abhorrent support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations that is currently proliferating on college campuses. This despicable antisemitism threatens the safety of Jewish and Israeli students, faculty, and staff all while perpetuating hate towards Jewish communities.

Across the United States, college campuses and leadership have allowed antisemitism to permeate without consequence following the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel. This resolution condemns the glorification of violence and antisemitic rhetoric and calls for college campus administrators to ensure the safety of Jewish faculty, students, and staff.

“American ‘elite’ universities across the nation continue to enable antisemitism across their campuses, creating unsafe environments for members of the Jewish community. This morally sickening support of Hamas terrorists by student organizations and lack of response by campus leadership exposes the proliferation of open antisemitism. It is disgusting that since the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel, there has been a 388% spike in antisemitic attacks across America,”said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to lead this resolution to ensure that campus leadership at universities including my alma mater Harvard are held accountable for their roles in enabling antisemitism on their campuses. We must ensure that Jewish communities are guaranteed their safety and that terrorist support on campuses is squashed. Joe Biden and the Far Left might not be able to call out this violent antisemitic language for what it is, but make no mistake, House Republicans condemn the propagandizing of terror on American soil.”

On October 13, Stefanik led a letter along with her fellow Harvard alumni in Congress to Harvard President Claudine Gay calling for her immediate action against the pro-Hamas statement signed by over thirty Harvard student organizations. Stefanik separately called for the Harvard President to resign.

Title: Stefanik, Colleagues Demand the Secretary of the Air Force Reevaluate Decision to Remove Air Force Special Operators from Fort Drum
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall opposing the United States Air Force’s (USAF) recent decision to reduce and consolidate the Active-Duty Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) enterprise. The USAF has decided to begin rapid consolidation of TACPs from their current basing at eight installations, including Fort Drum, to two installations. Removing these air support operations squadrons will critically impact the Air Force’s ability to organically integrate their tactical command and control of close air support with the 10th Mountain Division.

In theletterthe lawmakers state, “The Army 2030 force structure is designed to highlight the importance of the “division as the tactical unit of action…where decisive maneuver is executed.” Your decision to consolidate and realign TACPs will remove organic air support capabilities from the division and place them at the corps level. This will significantly degrade the ability of Army divisions to integrate close air support into their training cycles and will result in decreased readiness. Army divisions at Fort Drum, NY, Fort Bliss, TX, Fort Riley, KS, Fort Carson, CO, Fort Stewart, GA, and Fort Campbell, KY, each have unique institutional relationships with their ASOS units. Furthermore, any soldier who has been in a “danger close” engagement and has trusted a TACP operator to call in effective fires will attest to the mutual trust they develop through close integration.  Breaking these relationships will create a gap in expertise at the expense of the warfighter and will force division commanders to assume greater risk across all domains.”

"As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and the representative for Fort Drum, I strongly oppose the U.S. Air Force's decision to remove Air Force special operators from Fort Drum. This rushed decision will jeopardize our Servicemembers' safety and negatively impact our nation's military readiness,"stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik."TACPs are an invaluable resource to the 10th Mountain Division and continuing to base these squadrons at Fort Drum will enable both TACPs and the 10th Mountain Division to maintain the necessary trust and proficiency required to execute short-notice global missions that are critical to our national security."

"In a time where we are deploying forces to multiple theaters of conflict and actively working to deter conflict in the Pacific, we cannot afford to degrade the ease and strength in which our Tactical Air Control Party enterprise operates,"said Congressman Doug Lamborn."As Chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I urge the Secretary of the Air Force to reconsider this decision and continue to support our warfighters on the ground and division commanders."

The lawmakers are demanding further information on the Air Force’s efforts to consult the U.S. Army on the impact that this decision will have on capabilities within divisions at Ft Drum, NY; Ft Bliss, TX; Ft Riley, KS; Ft Carson, CO; Ft Stewart, GA; and Ft Campbell, KY.

Stefanik was joined by Representatives Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Buddy Carter (R-GA), Jake LaTurner (R-KS), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), James Comer (R-KY), and Tracey Mann (R-KS).

Title: House Passes Stefanik, Sherman Bill To Increase Oversight of American Taxpayer Funded Education Materials Used by the UN
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, the House passedH.R. 3266, a bill co-led by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (NY-21) demanding that the U.S. State Department conduct necessary oversight on the educational materials created by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and used by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). UNRWA’s U.S. taxpayer funded educational materials promote violent, antisemitic attacks and are used to indoctrinate children in Gaza and the West Bank.

In 2018, the Trump Administration decreased funding to UNRWA due to accusations that funds were going to Iranian-backed proxies in Gaza and the West Bank to promote terrorism and employ educators that regularly call for the eradication of the State of Israel and celebrate violence against Israelis. The Biden Administration reversed this decision and American taxpayers are once again the number one sponsor of UNRWA. The Biden Administration’s decision to reinstate funding without any guardrails has enabled Hamas to continue to attack Israel.

“In the wake of the continued Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel, this legislation is a crucial first step to address the appalling and unacceptable inclusion of antisemitic rhetoric in the curriculum used by United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) schools across the West Bank and Gaza. It's been long documented that textbooks funded by UNRWA have helped incubate the hatred of the Jewish people and demonize Israel,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Following the barbaric attacks carried out by Hamas, it has never been more clear that UNRWA successfully indoctrinated students throughout Gaza. This critical, bipartisan legislation will ensure oversight and accountability so that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not continue to fund antisemitic curricula. I am proud to see my legislation being passed on the House Floor to stop the funding of antisemitic curriculum which has encouraged such brutality against our greatest ally, Israel.”

Title: Stefanik Supports Passage of the Hamas and Other Palestinian Terrorist Groups International Financing Prevention Act Enforcing Sanctions on Any Foreign State Supporting Iranian-backed Terrorists
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik supported the passage of theHamas and Other Palestinian Terrorist Groups International Financing Prevention Actto ensure that heavy sanctions are imposed on any foreign persons, agencies, or instrumentalities of a foreign state knowingly and materially assisting Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or any affiliate of those organizations.

This bill requires that the President submit an annual report to Congress over the next three years identifying entities that assist these terrorist organizations and requires heavy sanctions be imposed on those entities. It also ensures that the President reports to Congress on any foreign governments that support these acts of terrorism and requires the suspension of U.S. assistance to that government for one year. It also prohibits that government’s transactions in foreign exchanges.

“Joe Biden’s weakness on the global stage has only encouraged aggression from foreign adversaries like Iran against our greatest ally Israel. Due to the lax enforcement of sanctions by the Biden Administration, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad leaders and their global sponsors committed horrific atrocities against Israel with little fear of recourse for their actions,"stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Peace can only be restored through strength, which is why I am proud to support this legislation to ensure that sanctions are applied to all individuals and entities who support terrorist organizations and ensure that Joe Biden is held accountable for his weak foreign policy that has emboldened Iran and its proxies.”

Title: Stefanik, Allen, Steel, Letlow Re-Introduce Bill to Modernize the Workplace to Effectively Identify and Validate Workers’ Skills
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Representatives Rick Allen (R-GA), Michelle Steel (R-CA), and Julia Letlow (R-LA) to re-introduce theValidate Prior Learning to Accelerate Employment Act. This legislation will accelerate the advancement of job seekers in the workforce by more effectively identifying and validating their existing skills gained through prior work experience, military service, life experience, or education.

“I am proud to reintroduce the Validate Prior Learning to Accelerate Employment Act to modernize how the workforce system weighs skills learned from military service and prior work,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Upstate New Yorkers, including our Servicemembers with nontraditional experiences and backgrounds, are ready to get to work but are often overlooked due to their lack of traditional academic degrees. Experience is an invaluable teacher, and this bill is a win for NY-21 as it gets qualified candidates back into the workforce benefiting our economy.”

“Too often qualified job seekers who possess valuable skills from prior work experience are overlooked by employers,”stated Congressman Rick Allen. “But having started my own construction business, I know firsthand how important it is to hire employees with the skills necessary to step right into the job. With nearly ten million unfilled jobs across our nation, it is imperative we move past the status quo and recognize that a four-year college degree is not the only measure of what a worker can bring to the table. That’s why I am proud to join my colleagues in re-introducing the Validate Prior Learning to Accelerate Employment Act, which will help ensure employers can find qualified job candidates through skills-based hiring and empower more individuals to achieve the American Dream.”

“Real life experience is invaluable in the workplace,”statedCongresswoman Michelle Steel. “This bill could be the catalyst for changing many workers lives for the better and filling a critical need in the labor market. I am grateful to Rep. Stefanik for introducing the Validate Prior Learning to Accelerate Employment Act and to my colleagues for supporting this legislation to invest in the futures of countless Americans.”

“Helping citizens find jobs and connecting employers with skilled workers is one of the most essential building blocks of a strong economy,”stated Congresswoman Julia Letlow.“This bill is a great measure to help put more Americans back to work and leverage the skills and education they have.”

Specifically, this legislation updates the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to enhance the use of competency-based assessments in the workforce system. It directs States to coordinate with industry organizations, employers, training providers, local workforce boards, and institutions of higher education to identify or develop assessments that measure an individual’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for the purposes of:

Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman McCaul’s resolution,H. Res. 559, passed on the House Floor declaring it the policy of the United States that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable.

Iran continues to expand its nuclear capabilities by enriching and stockpiling weapons grade uranium for the use of developing nuclear weapons. Following President Trump’s withdrawal from the flawed Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), President Biden actively pursued a new and worse nuclear deal with Iran. This resolution details Iran’s disregard for limitations on its nuclear program set by international bodies and recent estimations of Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

“Joe Biden's desperate attempts to return to the era of Obama’s failed nuclear deal is an embarrassment. Promoting a strategy of appeasement towards Iran has allowed Tehran to advance their nuclear capabilities and decrease their breakout time for establishing a nuclear weapon,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“While the Iranian regime props up Hamas and terrorist proxies in the Middle East whose stated objectives are to destroy our greatest ally, Israel, it has never been more crucial to ensure that Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism, does not have access to a nuclear weapon. A nuclear Iran is completely unacceptable. I am proud to lead this resolution to unequivocally stand against Iranian aggression and support the use of all means available to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.”

On August 21, Congresswoman Stefanik co-led aletterwith Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul to President Biden requesting a response to reports of the Administration pursuing a nuclear “agreement” with Iran while a hostage deal to exchange 5 wrongfully detained Americans for 5 Iranian prisoners and access to $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds was also taking place.

Title: Stefanik Supports the Passage of Resolution Calling on the European Union to Designate Hezbollah as a Terrorist Organization
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik supported the passage of Congressman Brad Schneider’s (D-IL) resolution,H. Res. 599,urging the European Union (EU) to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

“The radical Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah continues to openly operate within Europe using EU countries as its launching pad for its criminal and terrorist activities. Despite the EU’s clear counterrorism objections, the EU only designates Hezbollah’s military, not its political party, on the sanctioned terrorist organizations list,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to support this resolution urging the EU to take immediate action to ensure that Hezbollah is cut off from critical funding sources that allow it to carry out attacks against Israel.”

The EU already designates Hezbollah’s military as a terrorist organization, but has not taken any action to extend that classification to Hezbollah’s political wing which influences its military operations. Hezbollah continues to use parts of Europe as a launching pad for terrorist activities, including against our ally Israel. Classifying the entirety of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization is crucial to stripping the Iran-backed group of funding for its terrorist activities.

Title: Chairwoman Stefanik Nominates Mike Johnson To Be The Next Speaker of The House
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.—House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik formally nominated Speaker-Designate Mike Johnson (R-LA) as the next Speaker of the House. Stefanik highlighted how Johnson has dedicated his life to preserving America's great principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, principles that Johnson will not stop fighting for as Speaker of the People's House.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Mr. Speaker Pro Temp, Madam Clerk, colleagues, on behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the gentleman from Louisiana, Mike Johnson, as Speaker of The People's House.

We convene this esteemed body today at a time of great crisis across America, a time of unprecedented challenges in this hallowed Chamber, and a time when our most precious ally Israel's very existence is under attack from forces of evil.

Yesterday, our dear colleague, our former Conference Chair, our Chair of Energy and Commerce Cathy McMorris Rodgers nominated Mike Johnson in our Conference, and she put it best and I want to quote her today.

She said, quote, ‘Trust has been broken and we have come to a standstill. How do we restore trust between Members, leadership, and ultimately, between Congress and We The People?’

Cathy went on to say, ‘There's a sense that it cannot be business as usual.’ She went on to note, ‘Above the Speaker's chair in the House chamber is our nation's motto: In God We Trust!’ Ms. McMorris Rodgers went on to say, ‘The times in which we are living demand boldness...unity...and transformational leadership - that begins with trust in God and each other.’ Trust is when the magic happens. In the story of King David, we are reminded that man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.’ End quote.

Today is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our hearts and elect Mike Johnson as Speaker of the People's House. A man of deep faith, Mike epitomizes what it means to be a servant leader. A deeply respected Constitutional lawyer, Mike has dedicated his life to preserving America's great principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Mike is a titan on the Judiciary Committee and a dedicated Member of the House Armed Services Committee. And as Vice Chair of our Conference, he has united all of our Members to speak clearly and boldly on behalf of the American people. A friend to all and an enemy to none, Mike is strong, tough, and fair, and above all, Mike is kind.

And at this very moment, this Republican Conference knows that we live in perilous times, and the American people are hurting. Families are struggling under the pain of inflation caused by reckless Far Left spending - unable to afford groceries, heat, or gas. We have an inhumane open border with millions illegally smuggled and trafficked and tens of thousands of children lost in the chasm of the incompetence and negligence of the Biden Administration. Israel is under attack by Iranian backed Hamas terrorists committing atrocities with Israelis suffering the bloodiest days in modern memory. Crime is skyrocketing on our streets while there are vicious calls from the Left to defund our great men and women in blue. American energy production has been crushed by Joe Biden's radical, failed Far Left Democrat policies causing seniors, farmers, and families to pay more at the pump.

And Americans fundamentally understand that the federal government has been illegally weaponized against We The People, shredding the Constitution, targeting conservatives, parents. Yes, I’ll say it again. The federal government has been illegally weaponized against We The People, shredding the Constitution, targeting conservatives, parents and even Joe Biden's top political opponent.

The People are looking to this great Chamber to save America. And save America, we will.

And as we embark on the path ahead, I am reminded of Galatians 6:9: ‘And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season, we will reap if we do not give up.’

House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson will never give up. Today is the day we get this done. May God Bless our Next Speaker, Mike Johnson. May God Bless the United States of America and I yield back.”

Washington D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement after the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, under the leadership of Chairman James Comer, found evidence of Joe Biden receiving a $200,000 direct payment from the Biden family influence peddling scheme.

"As I have always said, I believe that the facts and evidence will show that the corrupt and illegal Biden family influence peddling scheme goes straight to the top, the Big Guy, Joe Biden. Today, we have found a whopping $200,000 deposited directly into Joe Biden’s coffers. Thanks to the investigative efforts of Chairman James Comer and the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, there can be no doubt that Joe Biden is compromised, corrupt, and unfit to be President of the United States.”

Washington, D.C.-House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik formally nominated Speaker-Designate Jim Jordan (R-OH) as the next Speaker of the House. Stefanik cited how Jordan will be America's Speaker "forsucha time as this"(Esther 4:14) and lead House Republicans in delivering results for the American people.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, Madam Clerk, colleagues, on behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the gentleman from Ohio, Jim Jordan, as Speaker of the People's House.

We are at a time of great crisis across America, a time of historic challenges in this very Chamber, and a time when heinous acts of terror and evil have been committed against our great ally Israel.

As this body convenes for the sacred responsibility to elect the next Speaker of the People's House, I am reminded of The Book of Esther: ‘for such a time as this.’ Jim Jordan will be America's Speaker ‘for such a time as this.’

A time when hardworking American families are struggling under the vice of inflation - not able to afford groceries, heat, or gas because of the trillions and trillions of dollars of reckless spending by failed Far Left government.

A time when millions are being illegally trafficked and smuggled across our Southern and Northern borders due to the catastrophic and inhumane wide open borders of Joe Biden. A time when violent crime is skyrocketing across America, destroying our great cities, suburbs, and small towns. Where people no longer feel safe in their homes or in their communities.

A time when American energy production has been crushed by Joe Biden's radical, failed Far Left policies causing seniors, farmers, and families to pay more at the pump and struggle with skyrocketing utility bills. A time when the federal government is weaponized against We The People, who they are supposed to serve, stripping us of our God-given Constitutional rights and wrongfully targeting conservatives, Catholics, and even parents at school board meetings.

And a time when the people of our closest and most precious ally, Israel, suffered the bloodiest day since the Holocaust. With acts of inhumane evil committed by Hamas terrorists backed by Iran - grotesque atrocities - the beheadings of babies, rapes, kidnappings, and slaughter of women, children, and the elderly, and Israelis and Americans taken hostage. We are here in this very Chamber for such a time as this. Jim Jordan will be We The People's Speaker ‘for such a time as this.

Our friend and colleague Jim Jordan is a patriot. He is an America First warrior who wins the toughest of fights - going after corruption and delivering accountability at the highest levels of government on behalf of We The People. Jim is the voice of the American people who have felt voiceless for far too long. Whether as Judiciary Chair, conservative leader, or representative for his constituents in West Central Ohio. Whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough, and principled. He is a mentor, a worker, and above all - he is a fighter. And the American people know, we know, that Jim Jordan is a winner on behalf of the American people.

Almost ten years ago, many of us sat with our colleague Jim Jordan in this very chamber when Prime Minister Netanyahu delivered his historic joint address - which some of our colleagues across the aisle shamefully boycotted. Bibi pointed out that in this very chamber, we serve under the watchful gaze of Moses. He said quote, ‘Overlooking all of us in this chamber is the image of Moses. And before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. ‘Be strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.’ He went on to say, ‘My friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength, and hope.’

On behalf of the American people, let's face the future with confidence, strength, and hope. Let's elect Jim Jordan our Speaker of the People's House - ‘for such a time as this.”’

Title: Stefanik, Cruz lead Harvard Alumni on Capitol Hill in Demanding Harvard Condemn Antisemitism
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Ted Cruz led their Harvard alumni colleagues on Capitol Hill in aletterdemanding that Harvard President Claudine Gay condemn the antisemitic statement made by over thirty student organizations at Harvard University.

Following Hamas’ brutal invasion into Israel on October 7, 2023, a group of over thirty Harvard student organizations released a statement blaming Israel for the Hamas terrorist attacks carried out against Israeli civilians. Harvard University leadership was silent for two days following the Hamas attacks and the student organizations’ statements. When Harvard leadership finally released their statement two days later, they did not condemn Hamas for their brutal terrorist attacks, much less address the statement of the student organizations. Following public outrage, President Gay condemned the Hamas attacks three days after they occurred.

The lawmakers and Harvard alumni express outrage and disappointment in their alma mater stating,“As Harvard University alumni, we write today to express our outrage and profound disappointment over the statement made by over thirty Harvard student organizations that blames Israel for the Hamas terrorist attacks brutally carried out against Israeli civilians. This statement is abhorrent, and we demand that you immediately condemn it publicly and clarify that Harvard University strongly opposes this dangerous antisemitism.”

The lawmakers continue,“It is sickening that students at Harvard University have such a deep hatred for Israel that they have chosen to ignore reality, celebrate ruthless terrorists, and blame innocent civilians. This heinous statement and the support it received from over thirty student organizations across Harvard University should raise immediate concerns into Harvard’s curriculum regarding the State of Israel. This type of unified hate and ignorance cannot be allowed at Harvard University, and you must investigate its origins.”

“The leadership at Harvard University should be ashamed. After over thirty Harvard student organizations released an antisemitic statement blaming Israel for Hamas’ vicious terrorist attacks it took Harvard President Claudine Gay three days to even condemn Hamas’ attacks.”stated Congresswoman Stefanik (NY-21).“Harvard leadership has still not denounced the students’ statement, this is morally sickening. Any voice that can defend the raping, killing, and kidnapping of innocent women and children has chosen the side of terrorism. I am proud to lead my colleagues and fellow Harvard alumni in demanding better from our alma mater."

“Sadly, there are few places on earth with more vicious antisemitism and hatred of Israel than American ‘elite’ universities. It’s disgusting, and it's dangerous. I’m particularly ashamed that student groups from my alma mater, Harvard, blamed Israel for the genocidal war that Hamas terrorists are brutally waging. It is past time for universities to stand up and squarely address the antisemitism that they have been breeding and unleashing, including on their own Jewish students."stated Senator Cruz (R-TX)."Harvard must decide whether it wants to be a true institution of higher learning or an incubator of bigotry and antisemitism whose students try to rationalize and justify child rape and mass murder.”

“What we are seeing at campuses across the United States is disgusting, but it speaks to a deeper long standing post-modernist rot in academia. There is debate and the free exchange of ideas – and then there is what we are seeing this week. These same students probably scream about micro aggressions and implicit bias, but now celebrate actual aggression based on anti-Semitism against women, children, and the elderly."stated Congressman Crenshaw (TX-02)."At Harvard, students should be learning the university motto, truth - but in reality they are propagandizing for terrorism, and they should be denounced for their actions.”

“When I was at Harvard, pro-Palestine protestors harassed my family and me just because they realized I was a veteran. There’s no logic with these people - if there was, they’d realize there is no equivalency between Israelis defending themselves and terrorists beheading children."said Congressman Mast (FL-21). "But Harvard leadership should know better. They need to make it clear that anti-Semitism will not be tolerated within the halls of one of the world’s most established institutions.”

Rep. Stefanik and Senator Cruz were joined by fellow Harvard alumni including Representatives Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Brian Mast (R-FL) and Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK).

And this was despite House Democrats’ attempts to delay, to obstruct, and to even pull the fire alarm to stop this important vote from happening. We’re going to continue to stand up on behalf of the American people, and despite being underestimated every week, we see you every single week and you underestimate us.

Title: Stefanik Demands Full Transparency into DOD Investigation of Employee Involved in Iran Influence Operation
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletterdemanding that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin provide members of the House Armed Services Committee and the American people full transparency into their investigation of a U.S. Department of Defense employee who’s reportedly been involved in an extensive Iranian influence operation to expand Tehran’s power.

Recent reports make it clear that Ariane Tabatabai, the Chief of Staff for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, was a founding member of the Iran Experts Initiative, a group of American policy analysts who worked with the Iranian regime to proliferate their false narratives regarding their nuclear program during the Iran nuclear deal negotiations.

Congresswoman Stefanik led her colleagues in expressing outrage at Ms. Tabatabai’s current employment and demanding accountability from the DOD.

In the letter the lawmakers state,“It is shocking and unacceptable that the DOD is employing someone who worked so closely with the Iranian regime. The IEI was founded in 2014 by Saeed Khatibzadeh and Mostafa Zahrani, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and top advisor to former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. A March 2014 email recently made public states Ms. Tabatabai was integral in establishing the IEI, which was created so the Iranian regime could offer “political support” to a network of analysts in America and Europe to spread Tehran’s influence during the JCPOA negotiations.”

The letter continues,“The allegations that a current Department of Defense employee has worked with Tehran to advance their narratives highlights a clear failure within DOD to properly vet employees. Following this concerning reporting, we are requesting that the DOD immediately suspend the security clearance of Ms. Tabatabai.”

“The Department of Defense needs to provide answers to the American people on why they are using taxpayer money to employ an alleged Iranian agent who worked to push Tehran’s malign narrative within the United States and legitimize Iran’s nuclear agenda on the global stage ahead of the Iran Nuclear Deal.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This egregious breach of national security is unacceptable. We are demanding that the DOD revoke her security clearance immediately and be fully transparent with their necessary investigation into Ms. Tabatabai. The American people deserve answers.”

"The Biden administration’s repeated, desperate attempts to revive the failed, Obama-era nuclear deal makes a lot more sense now that we know it was being overseen by acolytes of the Iranian regime."Stated Congressman Jim Banks (IN-03).

Stefanik was joined by Representatives Wittman (R-VA), Banks (R-IN), Bergman (R-MI), Waltz (R-FL), Mills (R-FL), Moylan (R-GU), Mace (R-SC), Wilson (R-SC), and McCormick (R-GA).

Title: Stefanik, Alford Demand Answers from DOD on Recent Reports of Poor Living Conditions in Military Barracks
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joins Congressman Mark Alford (MO-04) demanding accountability from the Department of Defense (DOD) in aletterresponding to a recentGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) reportthat detailed alarmingly poor living conditions in military barracks nationwide.

The report outlines how the DOD’s mismanagement of military barracks and complete oversight failure are forcing our junior enlisted Servicemembers to live in poor conditions that are negatively impacting their quality of life. Unacceptably, the GAO report claims that our soldiers are assigned to military barracks that pose serious risks to their health and wellbeing.

The letter highlights,“Our military is already facing an unprecedented recruitment crisis and poor housing conditions will only exacerbate recruitment and retention issues. We are committed to working with DOD to rectify these problems while also maintaining rigorous oversight of the Pentagon. As members of the House Armed Services Committee, improving military housing is a top priority and will continue to be a critical part in shaping future National Defense Authorization Acts.”

The letter continues with a series of questions and requests responses by October 10, 2023.

“As a Senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am appalled at the findings of the GAO report which detail how our brave Servicemembers are being subjected to subpar living conditions in military barracks across the country. I am proudly joining my colleagues to demand that the Department of Defense make safe and clean military housing a top priority.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Our men and women in uniform put their country ahead of themselves daily. At the bare minimum, we must provide our Servicemembers with a livable environment to call home. As our military faces an unprecedented recruitment crisis, it is critical that the DOD works to implement the recommendations of the GAO report and prioritizes improving the overall quality of life for our Servicemembers.”

“The recent Government Accountability Office report outlining poor living conditions in our military barracks is deeply disturbing. On a daily basis, these brave men and women put their lives on the line defending our freedoms; the least we can do is provide them adequate housing. Our soldiers are not asking to live in Taj Mahal. They deserve to live somewhere comfortable and safe that they can call home. What they have now is the exact opposite of that."Stated Congressman Mark Alford (MO-04)."The Department of Defense must rectify these problems and I will continue to hold them accountable.”

Title: Stefanik and Williams Demand Answers from New York Governor Hochul and Warn Against Return of Authoritarian Mask Mandates
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joins Rep. Brandon Williams (NY-22) in aletterto New York Governor Kathy Hochul regarding reports that New York hospitals will reintroduce a mandatory mask mandate.

New York’s authoritarian COVID-19 policies had devastating effects, from the unnecessary deaths of over 15,000 New York seniors due to former Governor Cuomo’s nursing home order to impacting children’s development with unprecedented school closures. The letter urges Hochul to consider the risks, costs, and efficacy of any new statewide mask mandate and to evaluate the impact of government healthcare mandates implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020-2023.

The letter states,“The COVID-19 pandemic and government-mandated lockdown took us away from our loved ones, stopped learning, and closed businesses. The failure of our state to acknowledge and measure the lost learning and educational impact because of virtual classrooms, mask requirements to go to school in-person, and the practice of social distancing will result in our state losing its competitive edge in public schools. Thomas Kane, the faculty director of the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard, said that “learning loss will be the longest-lasting and most inequitable legacy of the pandemic.” We could not agree more. Our children deserve better.”

The letter continues emphasizing,“the profound grief over New York’s handling of nursing home care during the pandemic. Several audits completed by the New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli discovered that the New York State Department of Health underreported the full death toll by as much as 50 percent from April 2020 to February 2021. Our senior citizens deserve a care system that protects them in their time of need. We urge your administration to measure, document, and report to the public the flaws that were made during the pandemic related to nursing home care."

“Draconian mandates left an irreversible impact on Upstate New York devastating seniors, children, small businesses, schools, hospitals, and communities and cannot be repeated,”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Kathy Hochul and the Far Left Albany Democrats cannot be allowed to use COVID-19 as cover to impose power-grabbing policies and exercise unprecedented government overreach. I will do everything in my power to ensure that mask mandates do not return to the state of New York.”

“As the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted working families across New York, leaders in Albany failed our local communities. By resorting to broad, draconian lockdowns, and ignoring the needs of New Yorkers, Governor Hochul subjected vulnerable populations to isolation, including our children and senior citizens,”stated Congressman Brandon Williams.“While not forgetting the irreparable damage done, moving forward, Governor Hochul must acknowledge the mistakes of the past and commit to evidence-based healthcare policies that do not restrict the rights and livelihoods of New Yorkers.”

Title: Stefanik Statement on New Military Child Care Fee Assistance Program in New York
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-CongresswomanEliseStefanikapplauds the expansion of affordable care services for military families, following her continued advocacy. Today, the U.S. Department of Defense launched the first military family fee assistance program for state-licensed childcare providers in New York. New York will be the first state to provide this critical childcare fee assistance to the thousands of military families in Upstate New York at Fort Drum and statewide.

Stefanikhas fought hard to ensure that the MCCYN-PLUS Program expanded into New York and was made eligible for the Department of Defense’s fee assistance program in past national defense bills. This fee assistance will help offset the cost of childcare for our military families and will provide a maximum rate of $1800 per month per child.

“As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and the representative for Fort Drum, I am proud that following my consistent advocacy, the DOD will provide fee assistance to military families in New York for state-licensed childcare providers,"stated CongresswomanEliseStefanik, "Our military families at Fort Drum and around New York sacrifice everyday to serve our nation, it is critical that we work to alleviate the difficulties of military life. I am glad that Fort Drum families will now have access to a fee assistance program for state-licensed childcare providers, opening up many more childcare options for our military families. I will continue to fight to ensure all military families have access to affordable and high-quality childcare service; it is unacceptable to expect anything else.”

Military families can search for and select an approved child care provider through the Department of Defense request-for-care website,MilitaryChildCare.com.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: House Republicans Are Committed to Curbing Joe Biden’s Reckless Spending and Delivering Results for the American People
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her colleagues discussed the results House Republicans delivered for the American people in their Appropriations bills, including curbing reckless government spending and securing our Northern and Southern Borders.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“A new nationalNBC pollshows voters overwhelmingly trust Republicans over Democrats on the economy, border security, and crime. And on the question of who is best fit to handle the economy, Republicans have a 21 point margin, the highest margin in the history of when the question has been asked. In addition, according to an even more recentMorning Consult poll,voters say that the Democrat Party is more extreme than Republicans by an almost double digit margin. And, of course, this weekend, a newABC-Washington Postpoll shows Joe Biden trailing the Republican frontrunner, President Trump, by 10 points.

Republicans continue to show why we were brought to Washington: to be good stewards of taxpayers’ dollars and combat the many crises created by Joe Biden and Far Left Democrats’ policies, especially the raging border crisis.

Last month alone,our Southern Border saw over230,000encounters. It is time for Democrats to work with Republicans to secure the border, and the majority of voters agree.

Last night was a big night. House Republicans passed the rule to bring four Appropriations bills to the House floor for consideration. These Appropriations bills include many, conservative wins for the American people and rein in Extreme Democrats’ reckless spending.

Our Homeland Security Appropriations Billsecures our borders by increasing the number of Border Patrol Agents to 22,000 and finishing the wall on our Southern Border. It also prohibits funding for Joe Biden’s failed, open border policies that have led to a border crisis across America.

Our Defense Appropriations bill: It eliminates woke DOD programs. It cuts 20 billion dollars from Joe Biden’s wasteful budget and redirects funding to warfighting needs. And it gives our brave Servicemembersa historic pay raise.

Our State and Foreign Ops Appropriations bill protects life by including the expanded Mexico City Policy. It prohibits funds for groups facilitating illegal immigration to our border, and it counters Communist China’s aggression.

And our Ag Appropriations bill prohibits foreign adversaries like Communist China from buying up American farmland. This is an important bill that I've worked on for a number of years. And it eliminates funding for radical Green New Deal policies, and it terminates Joe Biden’s Water’s of the U.S. Rule.

From protecting American values at home to ensuring our national security abroad, House Republicans are committed to curbing Joe Biden’s reckless spending and delivering results for the American people, especially securing the border.”

Title: Stefanik Applauds Supreme Court's Consideration of the Challenge to Gov. Hochul's Unconstitutional Gun Control Requirements
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik applauds Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for rightfully considering a challenge to New York’s State Executive Law 228, which targets law-abiding gun owners by requiring unnecessary and burdensome background checks and placing additional taxes on ammunition and firearm purchases.

In August, Rep. Stefanik led her New York colleagues in sending aletterto New York Governor Kathy Hochul urging the flawed system be stopped and instead refocus on the rising crime crisis in New York. According to Supreme Court records, Justice Thomas will bring the case to the full court for conference on October 6.

Congresswoman Elise Stefanik:

"Last month, I led my New York Republican colleagues in demanding Governor Kathy Hochul delay her unconstitutional anti-Second Amendment action. Constituents in my Congressional District have made their frustration known loud and clear. Gov. Hochul's state-run background check system and tax on Constitutional rights are causing serious delays and false denials. I have heard from constituents, including former law enforcement officials, who have successfully purchased a firearm only to be denied the ability to purchase ammunition. The delays are also causing community firearm retailers to lose customers who say they aren't going to wait and instead go to neighboring states for ammunition to avoid the state registration and extra taxes. Taxing law-abiding New Yorkers and delaying and denying their Second Amendment rights must end - full stop. I applaud Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for rightfully considering a challenge to New York's new illegal anti-2nd Amendment law. I will do everything possible to bring this unconstitutional siege on our God-given right to bear arms to a grinding halt.”

Title: Stefanik Demands Amtrak and CN Outline Plan to Keep the Adirondack Line Fully Functional
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent aletterdemanding that Amtrak and the Canadian National Railway (CN) provide a plan of action to avoid a future summer stoppage of service of the Amtrak Adirondack Line.

In June, CN implemented safety restrictions of 10mph, which shut down service when the temperature reached 86 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, citing concerns about the condition of the track. As a result, Amtrak suspended service north of Saratoga Springs for seventy-nine days. Currently, Amtrak and CN have no plan to make the needed fixes to the tracks to avoid a future summer stoppage of service.

“In light of the recent resumption of full passenger service along the Amtrak Adirondack Line, I write to you today to urge Amtrak and Canadian National Railway (CN) to work together to identify the requirements for track improvements along the 43 miles of track owned by CN in order to avoid any further service disruptions due to air temperature. Amtrak and CN must ensure that the Adirondack Line is fully operational by next summer. Without a plan of action, the closure of this past summer will repeat itself, hampering tourism and economic development and further damaging the close relationship between Upstate New York residents and our Canadian neighbors. This is unacceptable,”Stefanik said.

“Both Amtrak and CN had over three years of stopped service time to address any concerns they may have had with the railroad infrastructure. Going forward, Amtrak and CN must work together to outline a plan on the track improvements needed, ensure track conditions are safe for all passengers, and end this continued ambiguity on the availability of service of the Adirondack Line,”Stefanik continued.

“Our small businesses rely on the Adirondack Line to connect tourists and our Canadian neighbors to our region, as well as provide New York families with a critical transportation service. Our communities in Upstate New York and the North Country deserve the certainty of service, which is why shutting down the Adirondack Line during times of hot air temperature is not an acceptable solution. I implore Amtrak and CN to ensure that this service disruption does not happen again and to commit to a detailed timeline to provide certainty for tourists and families throughout Upstate New York and the North Country,”Stefanik concluded.

"It's crucial that the much-welcomed resumption of Amtrak service in our bi-national corridor is quickly followed with a clear plan from Amtrak and CN Rail to make the necessary upgrades in tracks north of the border so we don't face annual summer service stoppages,"says Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce."Congresswoman Stefanik's letter is a welcome act in shifting our collective advocacy squarely onto fixing the problem that disrupted service in the first place this year. We're not fully back on track until we have a clear action plan and that falls squarely on CN and Amtrak. Let the push for answers continue!"

Stefanik has been a longstandingadvocatefor full service of the Amtrak Adirondack Line. Following her continuousadvocacy, Amtrak fullyreopenedthe Adirondack Line in April after it was closed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Stefanik Slams New York Governor Kathy Hochul For Leaving New Yorkers Vulnerable and Using State Resources to Mask Her Reckless Sanctuary-State Policies
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement hammering New York Governor Kathy Hochul for the reckless sanctuary-state policies that caused New York’s illegal immigration and refusing to address the root cause of this crisis.

Hochulannouncedthat 150 National Guard members will be deployed to process illegal immigrants in New York City so that they can receive further taxpayer funded benefits.

“Governor Kathy Hochul and New York’s Far Left Democrats are responsible for incentivizing the raging illegal immigration crisis that is devastating New York. Instead of bringing in the National Guard to New York City to, by their own admission, process the illegal immigrants to receive taxpayer-funded benefits, Hochul should call on Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer to secure our Southern and Northern Borders by passing and signing into law House Republicans’ Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill in history.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Reining In Reckless Government Spending, Securing Our Borders, and Protecting The Second Amendment
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how House Republicans have been working tirelessly for the American people.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“The American people know that as a result of the Biden Administration and Democrats’ failed, Far Left policies, the National debt just reached 33 trillion dollars, the border crisis is raging across the country, including in my home state in New York, and inflation continues to hurt hard working Americans, families, small businesses, farms. It’s still the number one issue I hear across my district.

Members of the House Republican Conference have been working tirelessly to come together to pass a 30 day continuing resolution with important policy riders to secure the border including ending catch and release, restarting the Remain in Mexico policies of the Trump Administration that were very effective, increasing detention capacity, and requiring safe third country agreements for illegal immigrants seeking asylum as well as resuming the construction of the border wall.

Joe Biden’s open border policies have turned every community into a border community, devastating my home state of New York, and we know from our Texas and Southern Border colleagues, this has been an existential issue for years. Importantly, the CR cuts non-discretionary spending by eight percent. It fully funds the disaster relief funds, and it includes language to give the DOD much needed flexibility for the duration of the CR.

This 30 day extension allows us to continue our hard work in the Appropriations process to rein in reckless spending and ensure that we are good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.

In addition, this week, we will also vote on a resolution condemning the unconstitutional action of New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham that suspended open carry and concealed firearms in New Mexico. This is a gun ban that deprives the citizens of New Mexico of their God-given, Constitutional right to bear arms.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Reining In Reckless Government Spending, Securing Our Borders, and the House’s Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Mornings with Maria to discuss how House Republicans are working to rein in reckless government spending and secure our Southern and Northern Borders. She also discussed the House’s formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden and highlighted the mounting evidence that caused Speaker McCarthy to direct the House Committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On Reining In Reckless Government Spending & Securing Our Borders:

“Well, we’re continuing conversations with members all across the House Republican Conference, and I think what the Speaker pointed out is, this was a negotiated language between the House Freedom Caucus as well as the House Main Street Partnership. So, what are known as the more centrist Republicans with the very conservative part of our conference. And, I think it is a step forward in the right direction. And the important part of the CR is it also includes important policy riders related to securing the border. And I will tell you, Maria, that is a catastrophe no matter where you are, not just in Southern Border states like Texas, but in my home state like New York. So, we’re going to continue those conversations and ultimately, the CR will be a thirty-day government funding extension, but importantly, it allows us to continue our work on the Appropriations process. You talked about the historic national debt. House Republicans are committed to reining in spending. And as we move through the Appropriations process, that’s what we’re focused on, to rein in the reckless spending that we’ve seen under Joe Biden.”

On Rooting Out Waste Fraud And Abuse In Government Spending:

“I join my colleagues in saying we have to stand up for taxpayers across this country. We have to rein in our nation’s spending particularly for the next generation. That’s why we want to pass the CR, so we can continue, in that 30 days, to move good, conservative appropriations bills and really rooting out the waste, fraud, and abuse in these various agencies, the duplicative programs, and the gross overreach in explosion of federal spending that we’ve seen just in the past two years. Joe Biden and House Democrats and Senate Democrats added 10 trillion dollars in the next decade in just two years of unified single-party rule. So, this is an area where House Republicans agree on. This is why earlier this year when it came to the debt ceiling negotiations, this was the first time ever that when it came to budget caps, that we will spend less than the last Congress. So, we are going to continue to work through that appropriations process and communicate that with the American people who are also forced to balance their budgets in a very challenging economy.”

On The House's Impeachment Inquiry:

“House Republicans are going to follow the facts wherever they may lead. And that’s why this impeachment inquiry step is so important. It ensures that, constitutionally, Congress is at the apex of our power, so we can follow, indeed, the facts wherever they may lead. I have always said and I believe that this is going to uncover the greatest political scandal and corruption scandal in American history, that Joe Biden was deeply tied into Hunter Biden’s illegal business dealings, so we will follow those facts. I support the Speaker in taking this step towards impeachment inquiry, but it’s about transparency for the American people. We have to root out corruption wherever it lies, especially if it lies in the Oval Office.”

…

“Well, we have a very large Conference. And, I will tell you, Maria, since the start of this year until now, there are more and more Republican members who supported this step of taking the impeachment inquiry to the next level. And the reason for that is House Republicans have uncovered whether it’s the 20 plus LLCs that went to Biden family members, whether it was the over 20 million dollars that flowed into Biden family personal coffers, while Joe Biden was Vice President, and that money, of course, came from countries like China, like Romania, like Kazakhstan, like Ukraine. They’re very important questions that need to be asked about bribery as well as high crimes and misdemeanors. And you’re seeing more and more Republicans want to focus on the transparency and facts. So we’re going to continue to do our oversight work, and I think members, ultimately, when it comes to rooting out corruption, I believe they fully support that and are going to fully support this process moving forward especially as more facts and evidence comes out about criminal behavior.”

Title: Stefanik Co-Leads the CLASS Act to Counter Communist China's Influence in American Classrooms
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Congressman Dave Joyce (OH-14), and Congressman Ed Case (HI-01) introduced theCombatting the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems (CLASS) Actto protect American educational systems from influence from Communist China or the People's Republic of China.

This legislation is in response to areportfrom Parents Defending Education which unearthed contracts for “Confucius Classrooms” between 143 K-12 schools and a Chinese government entity across 34 states and DC, including New York. These funds come with incentives from the schools, including fully funded teacher exchanges, Chinese language programs and opportunities for American students to learn in China.

“American students are being force fed Chinese Communist Party propaganda as school systems nationwide accept significant funding from CCP linked financial institutions. In New York alone, China’s infiltration into New York schools totaled to a shocking $375,575 in CCP connecting funding. No price can be put on the minds of our next generation. As the new school year begins, Communist China cannot be allowed access to our classrooms and students,"said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to help introduce this bipartisan legislation, The Combatting the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems (CLASS) Act, with my colleagues Rep. Dave Joyce and Rep. Ed Case to block Communist China from having a seat in any American classroom.”

“As students across the country start the new school year, the Chinese Communist Party is hard at work attempting to influence their curriculum. China's attempts to interfere in American classrooms represent a direct threat to the national security of our country,”said Congressman Dave Joyce (OH-14).“This bipartisan legislation is a crucial step in preventing China’s influence from spreading into the American education system. Thank you to Chairwoman Stefanik and Congressman Case for their support in protecting our young minds in Ohio and across the country.”

“The People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party have demonstrated repeatedly that there are no boundaries in the deliberate spread of propaganda and disinformation, including the classrooms of the world,”said Congressman Ed Case (HI-01).“We can and should value real cultural exchange to foster mutual goodwill and understanding, but we must be eyes wide open to exploitation of our best intentions in our most valued institutions.”

“It would be naïve to think the Chinese Communist Party has any interest in furthering the academic development of American students. China’s involvement in our schools has long been an effort to spread their propaganda globally, a fact that officials in their own government have openly admitted. Unfortunately, we are just starting to understand how extensive their efforts to infiltrate U.S. classrooms have been,”said Director of Federal Affairs for Parents Defending Education Action, Michelle Exner.“A recent report released by our partner organization ‘Parents Defending Education’ showed over the past decade that nearly $18 million in China-linked funding has been found in 143 school districts across the country. This is a serious security concern that should alarm families and government leaders alike. That is why we commend the work of Chairwoman Elise Stefanik and Representative David Joyce for their work in quickly spearheading a comprehensive bill that will address this urgent matter. The People’s Republic of China has no business involving itself in our classrooms and we are confident this bill will make considerable progress in protecting students, their families, and America’s security.”

Stefanik continues to hold Communist China accountable for their overt attempts to buy influence in American schools. In August 2023, Stefanik joined aletterwith her New York colleagues to New York Governor Kathy Hochul following the release of Parents Defending Education’s report demanding answers on accountability for this funding. Stefanik alsoledthe Halting Academic Liaisons To (HALT) our Adversaries Act to prohibit U.S. institutions of higher education from receiving federal funding if these colleges or universities maintain partnerships with any entity controlled by Communist China.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Impeachment Inquiry, New York’s Illegal Immigration Crisis, & Reining in Biden’s Reckless Spending
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.—Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Shannon Bream on Fox News Sunday to discuss government funding, the formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden, and New York State’s illegal immigration crisis.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On Government Funding and the Appropriations Process:

“Well, we’re in a very good place. I’ve been engaged in conversation with members, as well as Speaker McCarthy, over the weekend. We are working through this and I’m optimistic that we will continue to move the appropriations process forward and that includes the D.O.D. Appropriations bill. That also includes, potentially, a Continuing Resolution to ensure that we do not face a government shutdown. But what’s really important here, Shannon, is on behalf of the American people, we know inflation is one of the top concerns. 91 percent of the American people are concerned about inflation. We have to rein in on this reckless, out-of-control spending that we have seen under the Biden Administration.”

On the Need for an Impeachment Inquiry into President Biden:

“The impeachment inquiry is an important step to take for legal purposes, to make sure that the House and Congress as an institution is at its apex of Constitutional authority, to make sure that we can get access to documents and, frankly, depositions that we know the Administration is going to stonewall. But it’s important, Shannon, to take a step back. Take a look at what House Republicans have uncovered. We’ve uncovered dozens of LLCs by Biden family members, including over 20 million dollars, some of which came in while Joe Biden was Vice President. So this is about Joe Biden and really answering valid concerns regarding corruption and national security.”

…

“I believe transparency and good governance is very, very important for any Congress. And we know that Joe Biden started off saying he had no knowledge of Hunter Biden’s business dealings, and then the White House quickly shifted their story to say Joe Biden had no involvement. We know, as we continue to uncover the facts, that’s simply not the case. Joe Biden was involved with phone calls with Hunter Biden’s top foreign clients. So, I believe that the Biden family, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, was deeply involved in this nexus. And, frankly, the question of bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors is an important one, and it is up to us as Congress to make sure that we deliver accountability and transparency to the American people. That’s why this White House is fighting tooth and nail to turn over documents, to answer questions, because they know we’re continuing to uncover what I believe is going to be the greatest political scandal of our lifetime.”

On New York State’s Illegal Immigration Crisis:

“The immediate crisis is to secure the border, Shannon. Let’s take a step back. Mayor Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul support sanctuary city policies. There is a reason that New York City is getting overrun and it's because of the border crisis and it’s because of the illegal transfers of illegals into New York State. They try to transfer these illegals to parts of Upstate New York. Upstate, not only New York Republicans but Democrats as well, at the elected level spoke out strongly against this. So, the way to solve this is by securing our border, which is why House Republicans put a border security bill on the floor. We voted in support of it. Tellingly, not a single Democrat voted to secure our borders. And it's why when we continue these appropriations discussions, one of our key priorities is making sure we have strong border security policies. So, this is a catastrophe of Democrats making in New York State and they’re going to feel the pain at the ballot box because 81 percent of New Yorkers, that includes Democrats as well, are very concerned and think this is a serious issue that New York is facing.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik OpEd on Military.Com: The Hard Work of Identifying the Remains of Service Members Missing For Decades Must Continue

Washington, D.C.-In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed onMilitary.comcommemorating POW/ MIA recognition day and highlighting the important work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) fulfilling our nation’s promise of never leaving a fallen American behind.

Read Rep. Stefanik full op-ed below.

Military.Com: The Hard Work of Identifying the Remains of Service Members Missing for Decades Must Continue

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

“In 1950, three service members from New York's 21st Congressional District -- Sgt. Howard R. Belden, Cpl. Clifford S. Johnson, and Cpl. Walter A. Smead -- were serving in the 7th Infantry Division deployed to North Korea. That November, many units in the division suffered heavy casualties during the valiant, but deadly, battle at Chosin Reservoir.

The three brave heroes from Upstate New York were listed as missing in action after the battle, and for nearly 70 years, their families were left in the dark regarding the tremendous sacrifices that their relatives had made.

That was until 2018 when President Donald Trump, while serving in the White House, met with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and secured the return of more than 55 boxes that contained the remains of American veterans killed during the Korean War. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) team successfully identified Belden, Johnson and Smead from these boxes and notified their families so they could give them a proper burial.

These brave service members are among the thousands that the DPAA was able to identify through their diligent work and dedication to fulfilling our nation's promise of never leaving a fallen American behind. I was truly honored and humbled to participate in two of the local ceremonies when these heroes finally returned home to their beloved families and final resting place.

As a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee, I recently led a large bipartisan congressional delegation to the DPAA headquarters at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, where experts study historical documents, lead recovery missions, and analyze remains to identify and account for missing personnel. Through their extraordinary laboratory and fieldwork, the DPAA fulfills the promise to American service members that they will be returned home.

The work carried out by the DPAA is incredibly challenging in far-flung corners of the globe. The DPAA continues to work on identifying the more than 81,000 personnel missing from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Gulf Wars and other recent conflicts.

One of the processes by which they identify remains is through their DNA identification laboratory where family reference samples can be collected and cross-examined with the service member's records. The family reference sample is crucial in making the final determination of the remains.

As we commemorate National POW/MIA Recognition Day on Sept. 15, there is a way for you to help this valiant effort as well. Currently, the DPAA faces a difficult challenge since it lacks sufficient DNA reference samples of family members of missing service members. The accountability process is meticulous, and often the family member's DNA sample can be the determining factor needed to accurately identify missing personnel. If you are a relative of an unaccounted-for American, you can contact your service casualty office and provide a reference sample or suitable artifact that will help the DPAA identify a missing relative.

With each passing day, the window of opportunity for repatriating the missing personnel closes. Like the families of Belden, Johnson and Smead, everyone deserves the opportunity to get answers after waiting decades to know what happened to their loved ones. It is a reminder that America will do whatever it takes and go to the ends of the Earth to bring our brave heroes home.

Our missing service members gave the ultimate sacrifice safeguarding our nation, and we owe an extreme debt of gratitude to them and their families. We each have a part to play working toward the goal of having all our American heroes accounted for. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to witness the tremendous work that the DPAA carries out, and I am hopeful that my fellow Americans will answer the call to help ensure every service member can be returned home.”

Washington, D.C-CongresswomanEliseStefanikvoted to send theProtecting Hunting Heritage and Education Actto the floor. This bipartisan legislation ensures that American students' Second Amendment rights cannot be infringed upon by the Biden Administration by amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to clarify schools’ programs training students in archery, hunting and other recreational shooting sports are eligible for funding after the Biden Administration’s Department of Education moved to defund these programs. Millions of students across the country participate in archery and hunting education programs to learn safe and responsible firearm handling and experience outdoor recreation.

In August,Stefanikled aletteralong with 70 of her colleagues to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona condemning the Department of Education’s decision to withhold funds from archery and hunting education nationwide, prompting a reversal by the Administration.

“I am proud to ensure that the millions of American students who participate in recreational shooting sports are able to exercise their second amendment right freely without threat from Biden’s partisan political agenda. Following my advocacy, Biden's Department of Education reversed course noting they were in the wrong on this long-standing bipartisan issue which provides kids with opportunities to learn about the outdoors and develop useful skills.”Stated CongresswomanEliseStefanik.“The Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act will codify that all shooting sports are funded and protected now and, in the future, allowing students to train safely and freely.”

Title: Stefanik Re-Introduces the Modern Worker Empowerment Act to Protect Independent Contractors
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington D.C.-CongresswomanEliseStefanikreintroduced theModern Worker Empowerment Act, along with Congressman Kevin Kiley (CA-03) and Congresswoman Michelle Steel (CA-45), to update the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act to create a clear definition and standard across federal laws to protect independent workers.

This comes as the Biden Administration’s Department of Labor is finalizing a new rule to create an obtuse multi-factor test that will undoubtedly lead to confusion for workers and take away opportunities from these individuals. With multitudes of differing state and federal statutes regulating independent contractors, theModern Worker Empowerment Actwill provide much needed clarity and stability for the American independent worker ensuring opportunities regardless of which state they reside.

“Millions of Americans choose to be independent contractors allowing more control of their schedule and increased flexibility. Despite this, Joe Biden’s Department of Labor has decided to turn their back on these workers proposing a new flawed rule which would eliminate this work classification taking away opportunities from hardworking American workers.”Stated CongresswomanEliseStefanik.“I am proud to reintroduce the Modern Worker Empowerment Act allowing the American worker to choose how they want to work, providing clarity, and consistency for creators and workers by creating clear “employee” definitions across federal laws.”

“Workers have the right to choose how they make a living, but due to California’s AB5, independent contractors and entrepreneurs have had a harder time choosing their classification.”Stated Congresswoman Michelle Steel (CA-45).“I am proud to work on this at the federal level to ensure there are more protected under federal law and give clarity to the more than two million independent contractors and entrepreneurs working across California who want choice and flexibility in the modern workforce.”

"California's AB 5 is one of the most damaging laws in modern U.S. history, causing countless freelancers and independent contractors to lose their livelihoods. Now, the Biden Administration is attempting to nationalize this assault on the Right to Earn a living and ensnare millions more Americans.”Stated Congressman Kevin Kiley (CA-03)."The Modern Worker Empowerment Act will protect the Right to Earn a Living and safeguard alternate work arrangements from being eliminated by the federal bureaucracy. This legislation is essential to advance economic opportunity and the American Dream in the 21st century."

The Modern Worker Empowerment Act is supported by: Heritage Action for America, American Bakers Association, Flex Association, and the Financial Services Institute.

They highlighted how House Republicans have been delivering on their commitment to a future that is built on freedom by empowering parents and students.

Read Rep.Stefanikand Foxx’s full op-ed below.

REPS. STEFANIK & FOXX: House Republicans Are Creating A Future Built On Freedom By Empowering Parents And Students

"As representatives of New York's 21st Congressional District and North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District, chairwomen of the House Republican Conference and House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and more importantly, as mothers and grandmothers, we find the state of education in America concerning.

Ask any parent and he or she will tell you that America's kids are in trouble. We hear it from parents nationwide, whether from the High Country of North Carolina or Upstate New York. The COVID-19 pandemic and extreme Democrats' extended authoritarian school lockdowns gave parents a window into their children's education. For the first time, parents had a clear view of the falling academic standards and the radical woke curriculum that was being forced on their children.

When parents expressed their opposition to the woke curriculum at school board meetings, President Biden weaponized the federal government against them. The Department of Justice directed the FBI to investigate and prosecute these concerned parents at the behest of special interests who labeled them as "domestic terrorists."

Numbers don't lie, and they’re telling us that parents' concerns that Democrats' extended authoritarian school lockdowns were highly detrimental to our children. The Nation's Report Card's 2022 assessment for eighth graders found that69percentwere not proficient in reading and73percentwere not proficient in math, the lowest points in nearlytwo decades. History and civicsscoresplummetedto their lowest mark since the tests were first administered in the 1990s. It'sestimatedthat most students would need, on average, an additional 4.5 months of mathematics instruction and 4.1 months of reading instruction to recover. These scores confirmed what parents already knew: in a matter of only two years, a generation of progress was lost.

That's why we, as House Republicans, made aCommitment to America. We demanded accountability and promised the American people that we would fight for afuture that is built on freedom, and that is exactly what we have done.

After taking the majority, weheldoversight hearings in order to hold the Biden administration accountable and quickly moved to passH.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights.

Parents deserve to know what their children are being taught. They should be able to see their school's curriculum, to know what books are in the library, and to get timely notice about any plans to eliminate gifted and talented programs. Parents have the right to be heard, without fear of retaliation. They should be able to speak with their children's teachers, principals, and school board members, and their school districts should seriously consider their feedback. Parents also deserve to see the school budget and spending. They need to know where the money is coming from, what influence it might be having on the school programs, and where the money is going.

Parents also have the right to protect their child's privacy. Schools should not be selling any student information to outside sources, and parents should be able to control how any third party uses their children's personal data. Lastly, parents have the right to keep their children safe. If there is violence in school, parents deserve to know. The Parents Bill of Rights gives a voice to parents all across the country and ensures they have a say in their children’s education. Sadly,not a singleDemocrat crossed the aisle to join us in affirming these rights for the American people.

In the face of a radical Biden administration, powerful teachers’ unions, and Far Left political opportunists bent on pushing a woke agenda, we have fought to ensure that schools are transparent with parents about what their children are being taught and that parents have the tools to enact change. We know that parents are the primary stakeholders in the education of their children and are proud to have delivered this result for the American people.

As students return to school this fall in the High Country of North Carolina, the North Country and Upstate New York, and all over the country, we stand with them. We stand for their parents' rights to transparency, a safe learning environment, and educational freedom."

Title: Stefanik Supports Joyce Bill, The Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, Passes on the House Floor
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington D.C.-CongresswomanEliseStefanikapplauds the passage of thePreserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act,which she co-led, ensuring American consumers freedom of choice when it comes to the type of vehicles they decide to buy.

This legislation amends federal law to block attempts by the Far Left to eliminate the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines. This will also restrict the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing any waiver for new regulations that would ban the sale or use of new motor vehicles with internal combustion engines.

This bill comes in response to attempts by the Far Left Governors of California and New York to effectively ban gas vehicles. In August 2022, California approved a new requirement on automakers which effectively bans the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines and light trucks by 2035 in favor of zero-emission vehicles. When Kathy Hochul followed suit,Stefanikled aletterto the New York Governor calling on her to abandon the plan that would limit consumer choice and raise vehicle costs for families in Upstate New York and the North Country. In order to implement these rules, California and New York need a waiver from the EPA, making this legislation crucial to protecting American consumers' right to choose.

“Far-Left Leaders like New York Governor Kathy Hochul are attempting to shove their Far Left Green New Deal agenda down the throats of the American consumers, shamelessly pushing out of touch policies that would ban gas powered cars in favor of electric vehicles ultimately eliminating consumer choice. For many communities in Upstate New York and the North Country, electric vehicles are not feasible.”Stated CongresswomanEliseStefanik.“This is why the passage of the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act is crucial to ensure the majority of Americans' voices are not drowned out by the priorities of the urban elite and to allow all communities to prosper without overbearing green regulations.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Highlights The Mounting Evidence That Led To Opening An Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington D.C.-Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how House Republicans’ rigorous oversight has uncovered evidence that President Biden has potentially committed multiple impeachable offenses.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Good morning. Welcome back. I hope you all had a productive August. We certainly did as House Republicans, and we’re ready to get back to work this September. Yesterday, as you know,  Speaker McCarthy announced House Republicans’ intention to pursue an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden. This is about transparency and answers for the American people and, ultimately, accountability for what I believe will uncover the biggest political corruption scandal in our nation’s history.

For the past eight months, through the course of our Constitutional oversight duties, House Republicans have uncovered that Joe Biden has lied to the American people about his knowledge and involvement in his family’s foreign business dealings and that he has potentially committed multiple, impeachable offenses. House Republicans’ investigations have uncovered evidence showingJoe Biden repeatedlylied to the American people about his own knowledge and involvement with his son’s foreign business dealings. When Joe Biden was Vice President,he joined dozens of Hunter Biden’s business meetingsby phone and in person. Detailed banking records show that the Biden family and their business associates received 20 million dollars in payments from foreign actors in places like Russia, China, Ukraine, and Romania, including payments during Joe Biden’s time as Vice President. More than 150 transactions involving the Biden family and other business associates were flagged as “suspicious activity” by U.S. banks. And a “highly credible” FBI source alleges that Joe Biden received five million dollars in exchange for pressuring for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian natural gas firm that Hunter Biden was on the board of, Burisma.

These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction, and corruption. And they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives which is why the Speaker has directed the House committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden. The American people deserve transparency, and this impeachment inquiry is an important next step to deliver transparency, facts, and accountability.

We are returning, as I said, from very successful and productive August district work periods where members were able to discuss with their constituents our efforts to deliver on our Commitment to America: an economy that’s strong, a nation that’s safe, a future built on freedom, and a government that's accountable.

We heard firsthand about the problems facing our communities including the destructive border crisis that is raging in my home state in New York.

Over the August work period, I was proud to lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific and spoke with government and military leaders from our key allies and partners in Japan, Singapore, and Thailand about the looming threat of Communist China. Funding our military and bolstering our defense capabilities has never been more critical which brings me to this week on the floor.

House Republicans will tackle, head on, passing our Defense Appropriations bill to counter Communist China, eliminate wasteful woke programs infiltrating our military at the Biden Administration’s ordering, and supporting our brave Servicemembers, with the largest pay raise ever.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik On Why An Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden Is Necessary & How To Fix New York’s Illegal Immigration Crisis
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Fox and Friends to discuss Speaker McCarthy’s decision to open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden and why it is necessary at this point in time given the mounting evidence that House Republicans’ investigations have uncovered. Stefanik also discussed New York State’s ongoing illegal immigration crisis and highlighted how House Republicans have already passed legislation that would resolve this crisis.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On Why We Need An Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden:

“I’ve been supportive of the impeachment inquiry going back to July, Brian. And it’s important to look at where we are today and the facts we’ve already uncovered. Since the start of this year, House Republicans have uncovered over 20 LLCs used by the Biden family. We’ve also uncovered over $20 million while then-Vice President Joe Biden. That 20 million dollars from China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania going into the Biden family. We also know that, according to very reliable, confidential human sources that has worked for decades with the FBI, that there was a bribery scheme when it came to Burisma and the Obama Administration’s policy for Ukraine. So this is what I believe will be the largest political corruption scandal in our lifetime and potentially in the history of the country. The American people deserve all the facts and transparency. That’s why we’re making sure that we’re pursuing impeachment inquiry.”

On What Powers An Impeachment Inquiry Grants the House:

“Well, the impeachment inquiry is an important step in the sense that it ensures that Congress is at the apex of our power when it comes to deposition, subpoena. We know that the Biden Administration and the Department of Justice are going to fight this tooth and nail because they don't want the truth and the facts to come out to the American people. But the impeachment inquiry gives us the most power, Constitutionally, in court, and I think that’s very important. And regardless if you’re Republican, Democrat, or Independent, the transparency is key here. The American people deserve to know the bribery scheme and the illegal acts and the corruption at the highest level of our government.”

On New York’s Illegal Immigration Crisis:

“Well, I certainly oppose that and have been one of the leading voices speaking out against the amnesty policies, frankly, that have been perpetrated by Governor Hochul, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, and most prominently, President Joe Biden. And remember, these Democrat leaders in New York, they were the ones that initially said, ‘We welcome illegals to New York State.’ Now, it is an absolute crisis. Whether it comes to we don’t have the economic and budget and fiscal ability to care for these individuals, that over 19,000 illegals that are now in school systems, that hurts hardworking New York families,New York students who already are facing significant challenges. And now, to give them work permits in New York State circumventing the state legislature, that’s absolutely, I oppose it, and we need to secure the border. You have Eric Adams, Kathy Hochul begging Joe Biden for federal funds. What they really should be focused on is securing the border because we know the policies that worked, and House Republicans passed the strongest border security package in the history of Congress.”

Title: Stefanik, Fitzgerald Introduce Bill to Bolster Reporting on Chinese Espionage
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Scott Fitzgerald (WI-05) introduced theCountering Chinese Espionage Reporting Act, to counter Communist China’s theft of US intellectual property.

The legislation will direct the Attorney General to prepare an annual report on the Department of Justice activities related to countering Chinese national security threats. The content of the report would include trade secret theft, theft of United States intellectual property and research, and threats from non-traditional collectors such as researchers in laboratories, at universities, and at defense industrial base facilities.

The report would also work to ensure that the Biden Administration’s Department of Justice is upholding the measures that were implemented under President Trump’s China Initiative to secure American intellectual property.

“Communist China actively engages in intellectual property theft to steal our sensitive military, industrial, and agricultural technology. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration turns a blind eye offering excuses for the CCP’s malign aggression in the hopes of an unrealistic “thaw” in relations."Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to join Congressman Fitzgerald in introducing the Countering Chinese Espionage Reporting Act. This bill will direct the Department of Justice to report on Communist China’s economic espionage and work to ensure our critical industries and institutions of higher education are secure and free from malign foreign influence."

Title: Stefanik Supported Bills, the Fight CRIME Act and the MAHSA Act Pass on the House Floor
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik applauds the passage of two key pieces of legislation she co-led out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, theFight CRIME Act(H.R. 3152) and theMAHSA Act(H.R. 589). These bills respectively enforce sanctions on Iran’s missile defense industrial base and mandate sanctions for evidence of human rights abuses by the Iranian government.

The bipartisanFight CRIME Actimposes mandatory sanctions on anyone involved in the supply, sale, transfer of, or support for, Iran’s missile and drone programs ahead of the October 2023 expiration of the UN missile ban on Iran. This legislation additionally requires the Biden Administration to provide a report to Congress on its strategy to ensure entities and individuals involved in Iran’s missile and drone programs are sanctioned to the fullest extent of international law even after the expiration of the UN missile ban.

“Joe Biden’s lax sanction enforcement and willingness to pander to the Iranian Regime, has emboldened the government of Iran to flout international sanctions. Joe Biden continues to ignore these clear violations of current international sanctions and hope that his ignorance will be a sufficient deterrent.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“We must pursue a maximum pressure campaign against Iran. Peace can only be sustained through strictly enforcing and expanding sanctions on Iran’s missile and drone programs while simultaneously bolstering our homeland missile defense architecture. As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have tirelessly advocated for the construction of a third missile defense site at Fort Drum. It is long past time that we enforce sanctions against entities aiding Iran’s missile programs and strengthen our homeland missile defense architecture to deter Iran's growing ballistic missile capabilities.”

The MAHSA Act honors the twenty-two-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by Iran’s Guidance Patrol for wearing an “improper hijab” and then reportedly beaten to death by police. This legislation codifies three of President Trump’s executive orders which sanctioned the Supreme Leader’s office and his inner circle, as well as mandates sanctions for human rights abuses by the Iranian government and blocks the property and prohibits transactions with persons who commit, threaten to commit to support terrorism.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Published OpEd in My Little Falls: We Must Never Forget
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed inMy Little Fallscommemorating the twenty-second anniversary of the tragic attacks on our nation on September 11, 2001.

Read Rep. Stefanik’s full op-ed below.

Stefanik: We must never forget

By Rep. Elise Stefanik

"On September 11, 2001, as the world watched the deadliest terrorist attack in American history, our first responders, military, and the American people rallied behind the American flag and vowed to never forget. As we commemorate the 22nd anniversary of this tragic day, we must work to uphold that promise.

When the hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania nearly 3,000 souls were lost. The tremendous impact of these losses was felt throughout America, especially in my home state of New York. Immediately following the first plane hitting the North Tower of the World Trade Center, first responders in and around New York bravely ran towards the collapsing buildings. New York lost hundreds of first responders who sacrificed their lives to save others. Despite each year that passes, our thoughts and prayers forever remain with the victims and survivors in New York and nationwide keeping their memory alive by ensuring future generations know of their sacrifice.

In order to preserve that memory, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure that the 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program is fully funded and that every first responder and every survivor is fully taken care of.

While we look back on this day with sorrow, we must also remember how the resolve of New Yorkers and all Americans was strengthened. The best of America responded to these attacks showing the world that the foundations of our democracy will not be shattered.

In New York's 21st district, dedication to the service of our country and appreciation for our brave patriots is felt in all aspects of life.  Our district is home to Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, which saw the most deployments of any US Army Division since 9/11. Throughout 20 years of combat, 10th Mountain Division soldiers were deployed to Afghanistan over 30 times to defend our national security and protect the American values that the 9/11 attackers so desperately tried to quell.

This is just one aspect of Fort Drum’s lasting impact on our nation’s military which is why each year I work hard to give Upstate New York and the North Country a seat at the highest level to ensure that provisions in the annual National Defense Authorization Act are used to strengthen our military and support our servicemembers. As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I proudly led initiatives to ensure our Servicemembers are supported. We worked to secure the largest pay raise in over 20 years for our men and women in uniform. Additionally, I led provisions that will ensure soldiers at Fort Drum are eligible for cold weather pay, allow Gold Star spouses access to commissary and recreational facilities, and improve childcare accessibility for military families. Our district houses large numbers of former law enforcement officers and first responders who have chosen to call Upstate New York and the North Country their home. The men and women in our military have served valiantly to protect and defend our nation for over twenty years since the 9/11 attacks, we must continue to work to serve them and honor them in our community of patriots.

As we remember the September 11th attacks as well as the twenty years of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, we must highlight the sacrifices of both our first responders and our armed forces who answered the call to defend our nation and preserve the beacon of freedom that terrorists have so desperately tried to put out. Let this day serve as a constant reminder that in the face of terrorism, the strength of America’s freedom must always prevail. May God bless those who lost their lives and their families on September 11, 2001, may God bless our veterans and military families, and may God bless the United States of America."

Title: Stefanik Leads Bipartisan Delegation in Asia-Pacific to Japan, Singapore, and Thailand to Strengthen Partnerships in the Region Amidst Communist China’s Mounting Aggression
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.-Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, a senior Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and House Armed Services Committee (HASC), led a bipartisan congressional delegation (CODEL) to the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, Singapore, and Thailand to meet with various government, military, and cultural leaders in the region to show the United States’ support amidst mounting aggression from Communist China. During the CODEL, Stefanik met with constituents from Clinton, Warren, Washington, and Montgomery counties who are bravely serving in our nation’s military.

"It was my honor to visit key partners in the Indo-Pacific region - Japan, Singapore, and Thailand - with a bipartisan group of my House colleagues,"stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“Communist China continues to encroach on our Indo-Pacific allies and we must continue to strengthen key alliances and partnerships in the region. Upstate NY is incredibly grateful for the brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country in the region and around the world. They represent the very best of our communities.”

The CODEL met with the leadership of United States Indo-Pacific Command, Pacific Air Forces, and the U.S. Pacific Fleet to discuss the Department of Defense’s (DOD) readiness and force posture in the largest military theater. Members toured the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory to see the important work of identifying missing personnel from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars and the process involved in returning servicemembers to their families and their final resting place. The delegation was also briefed on DOD’s continued recovery and relief efforts in the aftermath of the tragic Maui fires and paid their respects to the more than 53,000 veterans interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

In Japan, the CODEL visited the United States Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka and received an in-depth security briefing from Command Naval Forces Japan. The CODEL was later received by Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, met with Members of the Japanese Diet, and visited the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. To show solidarity with the Japanese people of Fukushima Prefecture in the wake of Communist China’s propaganda campaign banning the import of goods from the region, the delegation, joined by Ambassador Emanuel, shopped at a grocery store that sells products from the Fukushima region to show they are safe to consume and relay the message that China’s economic coercion toward our allies will not be tolerated. The delegation finished its visit to Japan at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, the largest and most active U.S. Air Force base in East Asia, viewing our air capabilities in the region including seeing the fleet of F-35s.

In Singapore, the CODEL met with the U.S. Ambassador and received embassy briefings, met with the Minister for Home Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also welcomed the delegation.

The final stop on the CODEL was Thailand, the United States’ oldest partner in the region, celebrating 190 years of diplomatic relations this year.  Members met with the Thai Foreign Ministry. This delegation was also the first to meet with newly elected Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and discussed the importance of the U.S.-Thai relationship and the continued desire to strengthen the bilateral relationship both militarily and economically to ensure an open and free Indo-Pacific.

The Indo-Pacific is home to some of our closest allies due to shared military and economic interests as well as an investment in democratic values. This bipartisan Congressional Delegation focused on strengthening our partnerships and encouraging continued cooperation amidst Communist China's increased aggression.

Stefanik traveled with the following colleagues: Ranking Member Jim Himes (D-CT), Congressman Jimmy Gomez (D-CA), Congressman Joe Wilson (R-SC), Congressman David Valadao (R-CA), Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach (R-MN), Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS), Congressman Brad Finstad (R-MN), Congressman Mike Flood (R-NE), Congressman Rudy Yakym (R-IN), Congresswoman Laurel Lee (R-FL), and Congressman Zach Nunn (R-IA).

Title: Stefanik's Statement on the Historic Surge in Illegal Immigration Across the Northern Border in NY-21
Date: 2023

East Greenbush, NY-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement followingChief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia's tweeton the historic surge in illegal immigration across the Northern Border, which includes NY-21:

"Joe Biden's Far Left open border policies have caused our Northern Border to see an unprecedented and historic surge in illegal immigration and Kathy Hochul's "Sanctuary State" policies have further incentivized this dangerous surge. Now we have reports of murder and rapes committed by illegal immigrants in Upstate New York. Enough is enough. It is time for Joe Biden to secure our Southern and Northern Border and the quickest way to do that is for Chuck Schumer to pass and Biden to sign into law House Republican's Secure the Border Act, which is the strongest border security bill in history and would put an end to the Biden border crisis."

Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia,United States Border Patrol Swanton Sector stated on Twitter tonight:

“Over 6,100 apprehensions from 76 different countries in just 11 months, surpassing the last 10 years combined. Swanton Sector Agents are resolute and determined to hold the line across our 295 miles of border in northeastern New York, Vermont & New Hampshire.”

Swanton Sector Stats:

At the Swanton Sector in Upstate New York on the Nothern Border,we saw an over 1300% increasein illegal immigrant encounters this July compared to July 2020 when President Trump was in office.

Stefanik: Biden Education chief sought to defund shooting sports classes in schools; yields to outcry

By: Rep. Elise Stefanik

August 31, 2023

“Hunting and archery are cherished traditions in Upstate New York and the North Country, where we enjoy a rich outdoor heritage especially in the Adirondacks. Our communities believe that outdoor recreation, whether it be hunting, fishing, archery, camping, or other related activities should be encouraged and cultivated from a young age.

During my time in Congress, I have visited many local schools that proudly offer hunting and archery education programs to students which provide critical life skills for students. These programs are beloved by Upstate students, teachers, and parents.According to survey data from the National Archery in the Schools Program, 40% of students said their participation in the program was a motivational factor for them to do better in the classroom.

Shockingly, President Joe Biden’s Department of Education moved to strip these popular and safe programs of their funding.This funding provides opportunities for millions of American students each year to learn safe and responsible firearm handling, lessons about recreational shooting sports, and experience outdoor recreation.

These educational programs have long enjoyed bipartisan support and have near unblemished safety records while providing the opportunity for kids to learn about the outdoors and develop useful skills.

The National Archery in the Schools Program boasts 1.3 million students, while the Hunter Education Association certifies more than 500,000 young hunters each year — supporting both stewardship of our environment and responsible firearms handling.

In response, I led a letter with nearly 70 of my colleagues to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona condemning the Department of Education’s decision and demanding a reversal of their action that would have far-reaching negative consequences. Acknowledging this intense pressure, the Department of Education issued a statement effectively admitting what they were doing was wrong and that they would work with Congress to ensure that these valuable enrichment opportunities remained in place for our students. I am proud to deliver this important result to protect these programs.

These important programs must always be protected now and in the future. That is why I am also a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5110, the Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act, which would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to clarify school programs “training students in archery, hunting, or other shooting sports” are eligible for funding.

I will always fight to protect the Second Amendment and will continue to lead efforts to preserve these important educational programs,which provide excellent opportunities for students to safely learn to use firearms and participate in recreational shooting sports.”

Watertown Daily Times: The second anniversary of Biden’s catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal

By: Rep. Elise Stefanik

August 30, 2023

"The attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001 were meant to instill fear. Instead, the United States courageously responded through launching Operation Enduring Freedom. For nearly two decades, U.S. Servicemembers and their families sacrificed greatly to carry out this mission. As we commemorate the second anniversary of the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, we must honor our Servicemembers who fought to protect our national security and defend freedom around the world.

Two years ago Joe Biden rejected the recommendations of senior U.S. military leaders and ordered an unconditional withdrawal. This decision halted 20 years of tactical and operational success and resulted in the tragic deaths of 13 U.S. Servicemembers.To ensure policymakers are never again able to make such a consequential decision so haphazardly, we must bring to the forefront the sacrifices our Servicemembers and their families endured throughout the 20 years of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.

As the Representative for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, it is my responsibility to honor the tremendous impact of the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan.During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, I was given the opportunity to highlight one of the last missions the 10th Mountain Division executed in Afghanistan.Following the Biden Administration’s decision to unconditionally withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, 113 10th Mountain Division soldiers from C-Co, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment were ordered to secure Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA), the last U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan, for six weeks as the Taliban closed in and captured Kabul.One of the witnesses at the hearing, Command Sergeant Major Jake Smith, the current CSM of 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, was responsible for closing down Bagram Airfield during the withdrawal. Responding to my questioning at the Congressional hearing, CSM Smith’s testimony highlighted the monumental mission asked of and valiantly executed by C-Co, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment at HKIA between July and August of 2021.

Over 20 years, the 10th Mountain Division deployed to Afghanistan 36 times. They were one of the first and last conventional Army units to serve in Afghanistan. In 2001, the 10th Mountain Division supported special operations units as a quick reaction force. The 10th Mountain Division then led a coalition force in Operation Anaconda to establish a U.S. foothold in Afghanistan and push enemy forces.Their professionalism and bravery led the coalition forces to successfully stabilize Afghanistan, remove Al-Qaeda, and prevent another large-scale terrorist attack from happening on U.S. soil.

The 10th Mountain Division will go down in history as the first Army division to spend 20 consecutive years in combat or in a constant state of combat readiness. This is a tremendous feat necessitating great sacrifice that must not be forgotten.Throughout this series of nearly nonstop deployments, 180 10th Mountain Division soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. These soldiers and their families made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation and we are forever indebted to them.

U.S. military presence in Afghanistan was characterized by operational and tactical successes, like those of the 10th Mountain Division, that served as a beacon of hope for the free world. However, the Biden Administration’s decision to unconditionally withdraw resulted in a colossal strategic failure as well as the devastating loss of 13 servicemen and women.We must critically dissect the decisions made leading up to and throughout the entire 20 years of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. This is why I worked to establish a commission that will examine key decisions and develop a series of recommendations to inform future decision makers.

While we honor the second anniversary of the catastrophic withdrawal and work to hold those responsible accountable, it is critical that we honor and highlight the Servicemembers and their families who for over 20 years served and sacrificed valiantly to protect America."

Washington, D.C. — Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined America's Newsroom to discuss how President Biden's open border policies and New York's "Sanctuary State" policies have created an illegal immigration crisis in New York, jeopardizing the safety and security of every New Yorker and her efforts in Congress to end this crisis and secure the Northern and Southern Borders.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

President Biden, Governor Kathy Hochul, And Mayor Eric Adams Are To Blame For New York’s Illegal Immigration Crisis:

“Well let’s take a step back, Bret, this is a crisis of the Democrats making. We’ve seen a historic surge of, not only our Southern Border, but our Northern Border as well. Over 5.8 million illegal crossings since Joe Biden took office. And New York, including the Governor, Governor Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams welcomed illegal migrants into New York State and into New York City, and now they’re reaping the crises that has been created and the havoc this is causing. Not only do we not have the resources to pay for this, but 82% of New Yorkers say this is a serious issue in New York State. My colleague on Staten Island, Nicole Malliotakis, you just saw the footage, Bret, this is very serious. They’re being housed in our schools. Our healthcare facilities are getting overrun. We need to secure the border. House Republicans have done that, passing the strongest secure the border package in our nation’s history. And yet, Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden fail to act.”

House Republicans Passed Legislation That Would Secure Our Northern and Southern Borders:

“As you recall, we passed H.R. 2. It’s the border security package, and we believe we need to secure the border to stem this crisis. And then, we fix our broken, legal immigration system. As one of the constituents from Staten Island said, ‘This is not opposition to legal immigration. It’s opposition to illegal immigration.’ We need to be a country based upon the rule of law. House Republicans have done this. We know what a secure border looks like, and those were the very effective policies of the previous Administration. And those were many of the policies that we included in our bill.”

BAIER:“Yeah, but the problem is, Congresswoman, you don’t have any Democrats signed onto that bill.”

STEFANIK:“And isn't that a shame? Isn't that shameful? They need to show courage. They need to show a political spine to say that this is a border crisis. Joe Biden’s policies are not working. Our policies have caused this and actually work with us to secure the border. That bill was on the floor. It’s pretty telling that every single Democrat voted against it. And this issue in New York State, when we talk about all states are a border state, all communities are a border community, the vast majority of these illegal immigrants are coming across our Southern Border, and yet, we’re talking about New York City. They're trying to transfer these to Upstate New York. It has been a disaster, and Republicans who stood strong against that were smeared by Democrats. Now you see Democrats backpedaling.”

Highlights The Impact of Extreme Democrats’ Open Border Policies:

“We don't have the fiscal resources. New York is a state that’s on the trajectory towards bankruptcy, and we don't have the resources. And what’s really interesting is that this has impacted the rule of law. This has impacted real people’s lives. Kathy Hochul under her leadership and Mayor Adams, they transferred illegal immigrants to Erie County in western New York. There were two very high profile incidents of vicious rapes, and now you see the democrat county executive say he doesn’t want illegal immigrants anymore, when he welcomed them into the community. So, this is very much tied into the crime crisis that we saw in New York State, and voters of all political affiliations know that this is not working and it’s a crisis that Hochul, Mayor Adams, and most importantly, Joe Biden created.”

Title: Stefanik’s Statement on the Second Anniversary of the Abbey Gate Suicide Bombing that Tragically Took The Lives of 13 Brave American Servicemembers
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement on the second anniversary of the heartbreaking Abbey Gate suicide bombing that claimed the lives of 13 brave American Servicemembers.

"Two years ago today, our nation was devastated by the deaths of 13 brave Servicemembers in the deadliest attack on Americans in Afghanistan since 2011, which was a direct result of President Biden's catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal. We will never forget their courageous service and sacrifice on behalf of our great nation. That day, House Republicans vowed that we would hold President Biden and his Administration accountable for their disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. Since retaking control of the House, we have delivered on that promise despite the Biden Administration's efforts to stonewall our investigations. House Republicans remain committed to delivering justice for those 13 brave Servicemembers and all of our Afghanistan veterans."

Title: Stefanik’s Statement on Governor Hochul's Request to Further Incentivize Illegal Immigration Into New York
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement regarding Governor Kathy Hochul’s formal request to President Biden demanding he take executive action to spend taxpayer money on free housing, healthcare, schooling, and legal services for illegal immigrants in New York.

"Governor Kathy Hochul's call for President Biden to take executive action to “address” New York's illegal immigration crisis would further incentivize illegal immigration into our state. Spending hardworking taxpayers’ money so that illegal immigrants can receive free housing, healthcare, schooling, and legal services is shameful, all while violent crimes skyrocket across New York State and illegal immigrants are committing heinous crimes. If Governor Hochul was actually serious about addressing this crisis, she would have called on President Biden to end his Far Left open border policies and secure our Southern and Northern Borders,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“The quickest way for New York to end our illegal immigration crisis and for America to once again secure our borders is for Senate Democrats to pass and for President Biden to sign into law House Republicans’ Secure the Border Act of 2023, which is the strongest border security bill in history. This bill would force the Biden Administration to restart construction of the border wall, end catch and release, and deploy personnel and resources to the Southern and Northern Border."

Title: Stefanik Leads Letter to Governor Hochul Over New York State Law's Open Assault on Gun Owners' Constitutional Rights
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led aletterto Governor Hochul alongside New York Republicans urging a delay of the September 13th implementation deadline of New York State Executive Law 228, which targets law-abiding gun owners and ensures the redirection of resources away from combatting New York’s skyrocketing crime crisis.

Executive Law 228 will require unnecessary and burdensome background check fees for lawful gun owners, diverting State Police attention by implementing a duplicative background check system to collect fees and increase bureaucratic red tape. Stefanik and her New York Republican colleagues call on Governor Hochul to focus on rising crime in New York instead.

In theletterthe lawmakers state,“Executive Law 228 targets law-abiding gun owners. It furthers government overreach, is poor stewardship of taxpayers’ dollars, and will duplicate and complicate federal processes that are already in place. Firearm purchases already undergo a background check facilitated by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), operated by the FBI. This state order creates a duplicative office run by the State Police to act as a middleman, transferring background checks from registered firearm dealers to the NICS on the dealer’s behalf.”

Thelettercontinues,“It is said that the revenue collected from the background and ammunition tax will go to fund programs that prevent gun violence in the State. Taxing responsible gun owners at a time of rising prices and out of control government spending is shameful and irresponsible. Responsible gun owners should not be the ones footing the bill to pay for the failures of Albany Democrats whose misguided policies have made our communities less safe. Taxing law-abiding citizens to clean up for failed Far Left policies is not only unconstitutional, but morally reprehensible.”

“New Yorkers’ Second Amendment rights are once again under siege as buyers and sellers are being kept in the dark about how to properly implement the burdensome new state order charging fees for firearm and ammunition background checks. Buyers and dealers have been left in limbo with no access to training and little information on the change. Clearly, this disastrous policy was motivated by gun grabbing anti-Second Amendment radicals in Albany rather than by commonsense and the public safety of our Upstate New York communities.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“Far Left Albany Democrats have once again assaulted our Constitutional right to bear arms and I will do everything in my power to stop their attacks on the sacred Second Amendment rights of New Yorkers."

“Governor Hochul’s endless attacks on Second Amendment rights of New Yorkers is unacceptable. Her new program is a political stunt that targets law-abiding gun owners,”Said Rep. Brandon Williams (NY-22).“As I always have, I will continue to fight government overreach and defend the Constitutional right to bear arms.”

Stefanik was joined by Representatives Nick Langworthy (NY-23), Brandon Williams (NY-22), and Claudia Tenney (NY-24).

Title: Stefanik Co-Leads Letter to Biden Demanding Answers on Reported Iran Nuclear Agreement in Violation of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul to President Biden demanding answers on recent reports of the Administration pursuing a nuclear “agreement” with Iran, possibly in violation of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015, alongside a hostage deal exchanging 5 Americans wrongfully detained for 5 Iranian prisoners and access to $6 billion of frozen Iranian funds.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The Wall Street Journal reported on August 11 that Iran had “diluted a small amount of 60% enriched uranium in recent weeks and slowed the rate at which it is accumulating new material.” This report coincided with news of a deal for Iran to release five American hostages in exchange for several Iranian prisoners and access to at least $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets held in South Korea and potentially billions more held in Iraq. Taken together, this strongly suggests your Administration has contemporaneously brokered a $6 billion prisoner deal and a nuclear “understanding” with the regime that are inextricably linked. This would be a clear violation of your Administration’s legal obligation under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (“INARA”; 42 U.S.C. 2160e), which requires you to submit any “agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran” requiring U.S. action “regardless of the form it takes, whether a political commitment or otherwise, and regardless of whether it is legally binding or not” (42 U.S.C. 2160e(h)(1)) to Congress for formal review within five days.”

"I have grave concerns about President Biden's possible covert nuclear agreement with Iran and his decision not to inform Congress of such a deal, which violates U.S. law. Making matters worse is the precedent Biden has set by agreeing to a $6 billion ransom for American hostages in Iran. For decades, standing U.S. policy was to refuse ransom payments, a legacy continued by President Trump, who secured the release of two American hostages from Iran without offering a cent of financial relief,"stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik."Joe Biden's continued weakness on the world stage endangers Americans' safety abroad and at home. House Republicans are committed to a government that's accountable and a nation that's safe. That is why I am demanding transparency from the Biden Administration. The American people deserve to know the truth."

Stefanik is joined by Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul.

Title: Stefanik Co-Leads Letter with New York Republicans to Governor Hochul Demanding Answers on CCP Funding to New York Department of Education and New York School Systems

East Greenbush, NY-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led aletterwith Representative Brandon Williams (NY-22) and her New York Republican colleagues to New York Governor Kathy Hochul demanding answers on a recentreportfromParents Defending Educationexposing significant funding from Communist China to 12 New York school systems and the New York Department of Education. Stefanik along with her colleagues are demanding for immediate action in response to the evidence of Communist China’s infiltration into New York’s Department of Education totaling to $375,575 in CCP connected funding.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The threats of ‘Confucius Institutes’ are well documented. Back in 2020, the State Department designated these programs a “foreign mission” of the Chinese government. The CCP is using the same playbook to further expand their information operations in our K-12 classrooms. We cannot sit idle and allow China to infiltrate our classrooms and communities through these controversial programs. We are writing to not only share this dangerous situation, but to request that you address this concerning report and the underlying issue of CCP influence in New York K-12 education.”

“Communist China is invading America’s classrooms, funneling over $17 million from CCP financial institutions into K-12 schools right in our backyard. New York’s Far Left Democrat leaders like Governor Hochul are asleep at the wheel, instead of prioritizing their Far Left Wishlist, they should be putting an immediate stop to the flow of cash for CCP access to the 12 New York school systems including the New York Department of Education.”Stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“This alarming discovery is an egregious breach of both our national security and an attempt by China to indoctrinate our next generation.”

Stefanik and Williams are joined by Representatives Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11), Claudia Tenney (NY-24), Mike Lawler (NY-17), Anthony D’Esposito (NY-04), and Marc Molinaro (NY-19).

Title: Stefanik Leads Letter to Biden Administration Demanding Answers for Iran's Increased Aggression and Enforcement of Oil Sanctions
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, NY-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik led a bicameral bipartisanletteralongside Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) to demand further information on how the Biden Administration will enforce Iran’s oil sanctions after growing reports of threats and attacks towards Western ships in Middle Eastern waterways and American companies who engage in the unloading of seized Iranian oil.

After the US seizure of the Suez Rajan tanker in April, Iran has dismissed oil sanctions and harassed Western ships in retaliation with no fear of reprisal as American citizens and companies involved struggle to trust that the Biden Administration will keep them safe from Iranian aggression.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“The ability for a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) to prevent the transfer of seized assets within U.S. territorial waters is an unprecedented intimidation effort that threatens to undermine our Nation’s security. No American citizen or company should ever fear retaliation from an FTO for assisting in lawful law enforcement activities or engaging in lawful commerce.”

The lawmakers continued, “We request that you work expeditiously to resolve the delay in the transfer of seized oil from the Suez Rajan and continue to enforce the law against Foreign Terrorist Organizations, such as the IRGC. The enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation. It is imperative that your administration make it clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations will not be able to prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations.”

“Iran’s ramped-up threats and attacks against Western ships are the direct result of the Biden Administration pandering to Tehran by prioritizing a flawed nuclear agreement instead of protecting America’s national security. Recent reports allege that Iran is threatening to retaliate against U.S. civilians and corporations if they engage in the unloading of seized Iranian oil. This unacceptable behavior shows the Biden Administration’s continued weakness on the world stage is only emboldening Iran.”stated Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.“I am proud to lead this letter with Senators Ernst and Blumenthal and Congressman Gottheimer to demand further information on how the Biden Administration will enforce oil sanctions, prioritize the safety and security of the American people and companies involved, and provide answers to this increased aggression.”

Stefanik is joined by Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), Jim Banks (R-IN), Don Davis (D-NC), and Max Miller (R-OH). Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is leading this bipartisan initiative in the Senate, joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND).

Content:
East Greenbush, NY-Today, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik released the following statement to mark the second anniversary of Joe Biden’s catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal.

“Today marks two years since Joe Biden’s catastrophic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. As a nation, we must especially honor the 13 Servicemembers who lost their lives in Afghanistan and their Gold Star families - an unacceptable tragedy that should have absolutely never happened.

As the Representative for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division that deployed to Afghanistan over 30 times during the 20 years of U.S. military presence, I promise to ensure accountability and oversight into Joe Biden’s reckless decisions that led to this failure.

In Congress, I demanded the Biden Administration declassify documents to ensure the American people know the truth, and I questioned U.S. military leaders who made it clear that Joe Biden ignored their advice. The catastrophic withdrawal and disastrous evacuation of Afghanistan emboldened our adversaries, and the Biden Administration must answer to the Gold Star families and the American people for this deadly failure.”

Title: Stefanik Co-Leads Letter to Education Secretary Cardona Condemning Department of Education Decision to Eliminate Funding For Archery and Hunter Education Classes
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.-Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, co-led aletteralongside Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) and Representative Richard Hudson (NC-09) to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona condemning the Department of Education’s decision to withhold Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) funds from hunting and archery education programs nationwide and requesting a reversal of their action.

Recent reports indicate the Department of Education is blocking funding for hunting and archery education activities under ESEA, eliminating opportunities for millions of American students each year to learn safe and responsible firearm handling, lessons about the recreational shooting sports, and experience outdoor recreation. The withholding of authorized federal funding of these programs with longstanding bipartisan support flies in the face of congressional intent and will harm students and communities across the country.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,

“This is the most recent example of a series of Far Left pushes by the Biden Administration and Education Secretary Cardona in the name of their partisan political agenda. Despite long standing bipartisan congressional support, the Department of Education has decided to eliminate the opportunity for millions of American students to exercise their second amendment right by safely learning to use firearms and participate in recreational shooting sports,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik (NY-21).

“President Biden has weaponized the Department of Education to defund certain activities that do not conform to his liberal bias. Hunting and archery programs give millions of students the opportunity to learn about the outdoors, the heritage of hunting, and how to handle a firearm or bow safely. These programs build stronger communities and for this administration to say otherwise just goes to show how out of touch it really is with the American people. This is a cheap attack on Americans’ Constitutional rights—specifically for responsible hunters and gun owners—ahead of next year’s election,”stated Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05).

“I’m proud to stand with Reps. Stefanik, Foxx and 63 others to call on Secretary Cardona and the Biden Admin to stop this war on sports shooting education immediately. These programs give our future conservationists and sportsmen and women new opportunities and passions, while teaching public safety, self-esteem, teamwork, and interpersonal skills,”stated Congressman Richard Hudson (NC-09).

“Upstate New York and North Country communities rely on our hospitals to provide critical services and are often the only provider of these life-saving services for miles. For too long the MWI, which is used to determine how much hospitals get for the labor costs associated with treating Medicare patients, has been severely underrepresented,’stated Congresswoman Stefanik. ‘I advocated for this rule change to increase in New York’s rural wage index drawing much needed resources to our hospitals Upstate.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: Joe Biden is Using the DOJ to Meddle in the 2024 Election
Date: 2023

Content:
East Greenbush, N.Y.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined The Mark Levin Show to discuss Joe Biden’s weaponization of federal agencies against his top political opponent in an attempt to distract the American people from the mounting evidence House Republicans have uncovered in their investigations of Joe Biden and his involvement in his family's influence peddling scheme.

Listen to the first part of her interview here.

Listen to the second part of her interview here.

Highlights from her interview include:

On Biden’s Weaponization of the DOJ Against His Top Political Opponent:

“This is what we’ve seen for the past few months, Mark, that when there is bombshell testimony that continues to expose the corruption, of what I believe is the greatest political scandal in my lifetime, that is, the Biden family corruption, then the DOJ gets weaponized against Joe Biden’s top opponent which is Donald Trump. They're trying to suppress the will of the voters and meddle with the election using the Department of Justice to do so."

On An Impeachment Inquiry:

“Well, Mark, I’ve been very forward leaning, so I support impeachment inquiry. I am in conversations with all the members of the conference, and also with Speaker McCarthy, who has said himself that he believes impeachment inquiry at the right time is an important, it’s a constitutional responsibility that Congress must undertake as part of our oversight. It's a tool laid out in the Constitution, and unlike the Democrats, who weaponized impeachment, these are significant corruption scandals of anything we’ve seen in my lifetime that we’re seeing with the Biden family."

On What House Republicans’ Investigations Into The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Scheme Have Discovered:

"But, we have a number of tools. Think about the oversight tools we had. If it were not for House Republicans, the American people would not know of the 20 plus LLCs. They would not know of the tens of millions of dollars flowing, not just to Hunter Biden, but dozens of Biden family members. Tens of millions of those dollars flowed while Joe Biden was Vice President. If it were not for House Republicans demanding those depositions most recently of Hunter Biden’s business partner, we would not have known, and the American people wouldn't have known that Joe Biden had lied, saying he had never spoken to his son about his business dealings. We know that’s false, and the White House has been forced to change their statement on that, even though they think the Americanpeople, they show a fundamental lack of respect by saying, ‘No, we didn’t change our position.’ It’s very explicit that the White House has changed their position to cover their tracks. The other tool we have in Congress is the appropriations tool, so to go after each of these agencies, when there are these politicized overreach, and we’ve just done that."

On How Joe Biden Has Weaponized Federal Agencies To Distract:

“But I want to point out some dates that are important for your listeners. It’s not just the past 24 hours that we’re seeing the indictment. We saw in June, when Congress got documents of Biden corruption, we saw the indictment on Mar-A-Lago from the Department of Justice. In July, the same thing, when we found more, when Hunter Biden got his sweetheart plea deal, you saw again, Jack Smith, a Far Left radical prosecutor add more indictments for President Trump. These are not coincidences, the fact that it happened the day after bombshell Biden corruption news. It's the mainstream media working and colluding with these government agencies to try to cover and cover up for the Biden family and for Joe Biden himself."

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: We Will Follow The Facts All The Way To The Top If That's Where They Lead
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joinedFox & Friendsto discuss how Joe Biden has weaponized the federal government against his top political opponent and House Republicans’ ongoing investigations into the Biden family’s labyrinth of LLC and their influence peddling scheme.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On the Weaponization of the Federal Government:

“Well, first of all, the American people see this for what it is, and that is a weaponized Department of Justice that is functioning like a political arm of Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. And this is on top of the egregious abuse that we’ve seen in these federal agencies, going back to 2016 with the fake, phony Russia hoax. And think about the amount of just news coverage from the mainstream media that pushed that false narrative. And the other thing that’s important, Joey, to take into consideration, this is the same week that Hunter Biden, this was a stunning week, Hunter Biden’s, immunity agreement they tried to slip in, thank goodness this judge paid attention to every word because they were about to allow Hunter Biden to get away with numerous, federal crimes and block him from any future prosecution. So, what do I think this means with the polls? You know President Trump is going to barrel towards a win in this primary election and in the general election, as well. There was interesting reporting last night that of the candidates, the one that Joe Biden is most fearful of, in his campaign, is Donald Trump, and that was not necessarily the case months ago. So what we’ve seen is this strengthens Donald Trump’s political position, and it’s because the American people are tired of these weaponized federal agencies and that if your last name is Biden, you get to live by a different set of rules, versus if your last name is Trump, you get targeted by the these agencies."

On The Biden Family's Labyrinth of LLCs:

"I do believe that there are more LLCs directly linked to Joe Biden and here’s why. Because this White House has been stonewalling all of our requests for additional documentation. And we need to follow these facts all the way to the top if that’s where it leads. And I will tell you, Lawrence, it’s because of House Republicans' majority that we’ve been able to uncover this, doing our constitutionally required duty of doing this investigation and oversight. It’s only because of Republicans and our work that we know about, the twenty, what I believe is illegal LLCs of money laundering and, frankly, pay for play of the Biden Administration. Much of that came in when Joe Biden was Vice President. So, we need to have all of the facts. The American people deserve nothing less, transparency is important in democracies. And we’re going to continue to deliver that. So, I always say follow the facts, and the LLCs are facts. The money flow are facts, and we’re going to continue to do that."

Title: Congresswoman Stefanik Introduces Wage Equity Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, Congresswoman Stefanik introduced the Wage Equity Act, legislation to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work.

“The Wage Equity Act is a practical, 21st-century solution to finally achieve equal pay for equal work by empowering businesses and employees to work together in pursuit of this common goal,”said Congresswoman Stefanik.“The Democrats’ alternative legislation would pave the way for frivolous lawsuits and unnecessary burdens on businesses, including those owned and operated by women themselves.”

“Leading retailers are committed to building a 21st Century Retail workforce that is diverse, innovative, and skilled. Adopting fair and equitable hiring and pay practices supports this mission and improves outcomes for all stakeholders, including workers and employers. For these reasons, we urge members to support the Wage Equity Act,”stated Evan Armstrong V.P Workforce Policy, RILA.

Modeled after bipartisan legislation that has been signed into law in states across the country, the bill encourages employers to proactively evaluate their pay practices and eliminate pay disparities in their workplaces, while empowering employees to negotiate pay based on their qualifications and merit.

Congresswoman Stefanik’s Wage Equity Act contrasts with the Democrats’ Paycheck Fairness Act, which benefits trial lawyers over working women, limits the rights of prospective employees in the hiring process, and impedes American job creators with millions of dollars in compliance costs.

Specifically, the Wage Equity Act would empower women in the 21st-century workplace by:

In contrast, the Democrats’ Paycheck Fairness Act empowers trial lawyers over employees and employers, and intrudes on American businesses by:

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: House Republicans Have Hit The Ground Running to Deliver on Our Commitment to America
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to highlight how the House Republican Majority has hit the ground running, delivering on their Commitment to America.

Watch her line of questioning here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below.

“When Republicans earned this majority just last year, our country was in crisis because of single party Democrat rule under Joe Biden’s leadership. But despite expectations, House Republicans have hit the ground running, working on behalf of the American people to deliver on our Commitment to America to combat the multitude of crises ravaging our country. And we focused on four major pillars: an economy that’s strong, a nation that’s safe, a future that’s built on freedom, and a government that’s accountable to We the People.

And despite being underestimated every single day, every single week, I see you all at the press conferences, we have delivered real results for the American people and provided a critical check and critical oversight on Joe Biden and his Administration.

As the Speaker mentioned, we reopened the People’s House, ended the COVID-19 national emergency, passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill in the history of Congress. And particularly as a new mom and a member of the Education Committee, I’m so proud that we passed the Parents’ Bill of Rights. In addition, we passed a national defense bill. As the representative for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, that pay increase, that investment in our troops is so critical, and it is shameful that the vast majority of Democrats voted no. And of course, we passed significant funding for our veterans today.

And with each passing day, House Republicans conduct rigorous oversight. And under the leadership of the Speaker, as well as our committee chairs, Chairman Jordan, Chairman Smith, who’s here today, and Chairman Comer, we continue to uncover more and more evidence linking President Biden to his family's illegal influence peddling scheme and the weaponized DOJ cover up, pushing the White House to, this past two weeks, publicly change their position on the President’s role in his son’s foreign business dealings.

Accountability is here, and House Republicans are leading the way. The dedication and discipline of my colleagues that stand with me today, and the whole of this House Republican majority, we are proud to have delivered these real results, and we will continue to be laser focused on delivering wins for the American people. And we are just getting started.”

Title: Stefanik Introduces Military Families and Surviving Spouses Benefits Enhancement Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Today, Congresswoman Stefanik introduced the bipartisan Military Families and Surviving Spouses Benefits Enhancement Act, legislation that supports military families by easing the financial burden on active-duty military spouses when they are challenged with the loss of employment due to the Servicemember's change of duty location. This bill also restores non-monetary survivor benefits to the remarried spouses of fallen U.S. Servicemembers.

“Military families face difficult and unique challenges ranging from frequent moves to the devastating loss of their loved ones,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik."I am honored to introduce this common-sense, bipartisan legislation that will support our brave military spouses and families when they are faced with difficult times. Our Servicemembers would not be able to complete their mission without their family’s support, which is why I will always be the staunchest advocate of our military families across Upstate New York and the North Country.”

“When our men and women in uniform deploy overseas, military spouses and their families face a unique set of challenges here at home,”stated Congressman Norcross.“Military families are the backbone of our armed forces and national defense, and we owe them more than a debt of gratitude. I am proud to support this legislation that will give families peace of mind during a difficult time of loss or transition and ensure they are supported. I will continue to fight for our armed forces and military families in South Jersey and across the country.”

“TAPS is grateful to Representative Stefanik for her leadership in introducing the Military Families and Surviving Spouses Benefits Enhancement Act,”stated Bonnie Carroll, President and Founder, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.“This important legislation will ensure surviving military spouses retain their base access and federal hiring preference upon remarriage. Being widowed should not penalize them from finding love in the future.”

“It is our responsibility as a nation to ensure the well-being our servicemembers and their families, especially our Gold Star families who have lost a loved one serving our nation. The least we can do is provide them with any benefits and support they need,”said National Association of Mortgage Brokers President Ernest Jones.“We should never allow restrictions to cut off survivor benefits of military widows and widowers simply because they choose to remarry. As President of NAMB, I will always support any legislation that ensures that Gold Star spouses retain their survivor benefits, and I applaud Congresswoman Stefanik for leading this effort.”

The new Military Families and Surviving Spouses Benefits Enhancement Act would support our military families by:

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik Questions CSM Jake Smith at House Foreign Affairs Oversight Subcommittee Hearing on the Biden Administration's Catastrophic Withdrawal from Afghanistan
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— At the House Foreign Affairs Oversight Subcommittee hearing on the Biden Administration’s catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik questionedCommand Sergeant MajorJake Smith, the current Infantry Battalion Command Sergeant Major at Fort Drum, who testified before the panel on the State Department’s recently released after-action report.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik:Thank you Chairman Mast and Chairman McCaul, for the opportunity to waive on this hearing on this committee today. I would like to start by thanking our witnesses for their service, sacrifice, and your testimony today.

Command Sergeant Major Smith, I am especially grateful that you took on this tremendous responsibility of testifying, as I have the distinct honor of representing Fort Drum, home of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed division in the U.S. Army since 9/11. And I want to make sure in today’s hearing that we remember to highlight that although Joe Biden and the Biden Administration made reckless decisions that resulted in the avoidable, tragic deaths of our Servicemembers, it is important to recognize so many men and women in uniform who served valiantly and bravely.

In the spring of 2021, Command Sergeant Major Smith, you met with a U.S. embassy site survey team, and they told you they were considering Bagram and HKIA (H-kaya) as two potential evacuation operation sites.

Why did you advise the site survey team against using HKIA and were your concerns taken into consideration?

CSM Jake Smith:I appreciate you letting me speak. As far as the site survey team taking my advice into consideration, I don’t know the private conversations they had. I cannot speak on that. From my standpoint, Bagram had a much more tactical advantage to conducting EO out of. It was much easier to defend. The entry control points were very much defended in depth. It would have been very easy to create a filtering process within those entry control points to filter out those who needed to be evacuated and those who didn’t. It was just a much more tactically advantageous location.

Congresswoman Stefanik:Meanwhile, the Taliban was rapidly advancing on Kabul and every day it became clearer that an evacuation would likely be necessary. The recently released State Department After Action Review shows that the Biden Administration understood that the closure of Bagram meant that the only place this evacuation would be conducted would be HKIA. We know there were 113 soldiers from Charlie Company 431 of the 10th Mountain Division assigned to protect HKIA as the Taliban was rapidly approaching. From your extensive experience in Afghanistan, was a company-sized element adequate to perform the mission the 10th Mountain Division soldiers were assigned?

CSM Jake Smith:If I was in command, I would have had at least a battalion there.

Congresswoman Stefanik:A battalion. That is a big difference from a company. This disastrous decision leading up to the Afghanistan withdrawal forced Charlie Company 431 into a mission that was nearly impossible to execute. And yet, for over a month, the brave soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division defended HKIA as Afghanistan was engulfed in chaos. This hearing is important to bring transparency and shed light and ultimately answers to those families, particularly our Gold Star families of whom I know some are here today. We can never thank them enough for their sacrifice, thank you for your service, and I yield back the balance, Chairman Mast.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: "Absolutely" Supports Speaker McCarthy's Statement regarding Potential Impeachment Inquiry of Joe Biden
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.--Congresswoman Stefanik joined Mornings with Maria on the Fox Business Network to discuss how she “absolutely” supports Speaker McCarthy’s statement regarding a potential impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden as it would ensure that the House is at the apex of its power and oversight responsibility.

Stefanik also highlighted how the White House is lying to the American people and has suddenly shifted its public position surrounding Joe Biden's knowledge and involvement in Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings because of House Republicans' rigorous oversight.

Watch her full interview here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On Supporting an Impeachment Inquiry of Joe Biden:

KAYLEE MCGHEE WHITE:“Some Republicans in the House have floated a potential impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden over this issue. Is that something that you would support?”

“Absolutely. I’m in conversations with Speaker McCarthy and all of our members, and the important thing to know about impeachment inquiry is that ensures that the House is at the apex of its power and oversight responsibility. So, it means that our subpoenas have the most power possible when it comes to litigating this out in court because we know getting the facts is not going to be easy. We know that this White House, this Department of Justice, they are trying to cover up for Hunter Biden and ultimately Joe Biden and what is important that you mentioned at the beginning of your statement is the White House is trying to quietly change its language. First it said that Joe Biden never spoke to his son, Hunter Biden, about Hunter’s business dealings. They have changed that language to now saying Joe Biden has never been in business with Hunter Biden’s business operations. That is a significant change, and the fact that the White House Press Secretary lied to the American people to say oh, no it’s the same position we’ve always had, it is only because of House Republicans that we discovered the dozens of LLCs, which is illegal money laundering. The fact that nearly 20 Biden family members have profited illegally. I believe that the American people are smart. They understand that the ‘Big Guy’ is Joe Biden. But having that impeachment inquiry allows us to get all the facts and have the most constitutionally recognized power from the House of Representatives.

…

“I’ve been one of the most forward leaning in saying we need to leave no stone unturned and ultimately I believe we’re going to find more LLCs. And I believe we’re going to find LLCs that go straight to Joe Biden himself, and the American people deserve to know that. They deserve to have all of the facts, and we’re going to do that. And I believe that what we’ve uncovered just in seven months alone is stunning, it is chilling, it is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime and perhaps the last century, perhaps ever. But I want to make sure that we have all the evidence possible. The American people deserve nothing less especially as we’re seeing Joe Biden, his weak policies but they need to understand the level of corruption, that it goes straight to the top.”

On the White House Changing Position Regarding Joe Biden’s Knowledge and Involvement In Hunter Biden’s Business Dealings:

“The American people are smart. They know that the White House is trying to cover their tracks. They know that they're having to change their position because we’ve shown evidence that Joe Biden has spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings. And what’s worse, he did so and I believe was intimately involved when he was the sitting Vice President. And now he’s involved in forcing the Department of Justice to cover up and protect the Biden family, to protect them from the rule of law and prosecution. That’s fundamentally unAmerican. And as I said, it is our constitutional responsibility to root out corruption in every agency, and we’re going to do that as House Republicans and I’ve been proud standing in the breach on some of the toughest fights we’ve had related to the unconstitutional impeachment under the Democrats. We’re going to do things right and follow the facts and evidence and make sure the impeachment inquiry, our subpoenas, and our requests for documents have the most understanding and that the judges rule in favor of the House of Representatives when it comes to our constitutional responsibility of oversight.

Title: Stefanik Co-Leads Letter to Customs and Border Protection Urging Resolving of Northern Border Staffing Shortages
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Stefanik, Co-Chair of the Northern Border Caucus, co-led aletterwith Rep. Higgins (D-NY) to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), requesting that CBP and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) address staffing and resource shortages at the Northern Border.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“Excessive delays for travelers cannot continue as we are in the busy summer travel season. CBP must always properly staff our Northern Border ports of entry in order to ensure border crossings are as seamless as possible for both our constituents and our Canadian neighbors to the North. We strongly urge that you maintain requisite resources at the Northern Border to allow for its proper functioning.”

"It's frustrating that we have succeeded in restoring Canadian visitation at our Champlain border crossing to a level of 92% of pre-pandemic 2019 numbers but then are confronting them with long wait times,"states Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce."While everyone can appreciate the staffing demands at the southern border, we cannot sacrifice the flow of legitimate travel and commerce at our northern border, robbing Peter to pay Paul. We need full staffing at the Canadian border and adequate resources to complete the important mission of restoring full and normal cross border travel and business connections. We thank Congresswoman Stefanik and Congressman Higgins for their solidarity and advocacy."

Stefanik and Higgins explain that inspection booths at Northern Border Ports of Entry are understaffed, and they have received reports of only two out of twelve regular inspection lanes being closed at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, New York. They also state that at the border crossing between Champlain, New York and St. Bernard de Lacolle, Quebec, wait times have tripled, on average, and some days, waits can be over two hours long. The lawmakers explain that long waits dissuade travelers from crossing the border, stifle economic activity, and cause undue harm to our border communities.

As a co-chair of the Northern Border Caucus, Congresswoman Stefanik has continually called on CBP to ensure resources and proper staffing levels are maintained at the Northern Border.

Title: Stefanik, Costa, Crawford Agriculture Security Bill Passed Senate, To Be Included in the Senate's National Defense Authorization Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA), and Congressman Rick Crawford (R-AR) led the Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security (PASS) Act, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support and will now be included in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24). Senator Rounds (R-SD) and Tester (D-MT) led the NDAA amendment in the Senate.

The Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security (PASS) Act will protect our national security by prohibiting foreign adversaries from purchasing or controlling U.S. agricultural land and businesses. Our foreign adversaries, specifically Communist China, are purchasing U.S. agricultural land to undermine our food security and gain access to our sensitive military installations. The inclusion of the PASS Act into the NDAA will ensure that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is involved in reviewing foreign acquisition of American agricultural land and businesses and blacklists our foreign adversaries from controlling U.S. agricultural land.

“Food security is national security, and I am proud that the Senate advanced my bill that will stand up against our foreign adversaries as they attempt to assert control over our agriculture industry,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“The United States cannot allow malign ownership bids of American assets by Communist China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea to undermine the efforts of our farmers, whose hard work feeds and fuels our communities. We cannot allow our adversaries to control land near our military installations and we cannot cede any ownership of our food supply to those who are actively working against our security interests.”

“Food is a national security issue, and we need to take steps to protect American farmland,”stated Congressman Costa.“The PASS Act will safeguard our food supply chain and ensure American agriculture is operated by American businesses.”

"Agriculture security is national security, and Congress has a duty to protect our food supply and those who produce it from our adversaries. In today’s world, nations like China and Russia are targeting critical American infrastructure not through warfare, but through espionage, cyberattacks, and even acquisition of businesses. It is time to ensure that our nation’s agricultural sector is secure from these attacks as well. I’m pleased to see my colleagues in the Senate give this issue the attention it deserves,”stated Congressman Crawford.

The Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security (PASS) Act:

Next, the Senate will work to pass the NDAA, and the bill will be reconciled with the House-passed NDAA.

Title: ICYMI: Fox News Reports: Stefanik Leads Top House Republicans in Demanding Answers on Shifting White House Message on Biden's Role in Hunter's Business
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— On Thursday,Fox Newsreported that Congresswoman Stefanik,House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chair James Comer (R-KY), House Committee on the Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), and House Committee on Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) sent a letter to White House Counsel Stuart Delery demanding answers about the White House’s “clear shift” in messaging regarding President Biden’s knowledge of and involvement in his son Hunter Biden’s corrupt foreign business dealings.

The White House refused to comment on Fox News’ reporting.

According toFox News:

“Top House Republicans said Thursday that there has been a "clear shift" in messaging from the White House on President Biden’s involvement in son Hunter’s foreign business dealings, and they are demanding to know whether that shift indicates the president knew more than he let on.

House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith wrote a letter, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, to White House Counsel Stuart Delery on Thursday afternoon to seek clarity on this shifting message.

"President Biden and official White House spokespersons have said repeatedly that the president had no knowledge of his son’s business, nor did he discuss business with his son," they wrote.But they pointed to a June 29 statement released by White House spokesperson from the White House Counsel’s Office Ian Sams, which they said seemed to move the goalposts.

On that day, Sams said, "As we have said many times before, the president was not in business with his son."

The White House has previously said the president never spoke to his son about his business dealings and had no knowledge of them. The president himself has also denied ever having spoken to his son about his business dealings or being involved in them.

As a result of this apparent messaging shift, the four GOP lawmakers asked the White House to answer a series of questions, including whether the White House is "now admitting President Biden knew of and was involved in Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings," how many of those foreign business deals he was "aware of," what President Biden’s involvement was, and whether he was "financially compensated for his involvement."

….

They gave the White House counsel until July 27 to provide answers.The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.”

This letter was sent on the same day that we learned of new allegation from “highly credible”confidential human source for the FBI that President Biden received millions of dollars from an Ukrainian gas company that Hunter Biden was on the board of in exchange for getting a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the company fired.

Title: Stefanik Bipartisan Bill Supporting Plattsburgh Airport Included in FAA Reauthorization, Passes House of Representatives
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Stefanik secured critical provisions of her bipartisan bill, the Border Airport Enhancement Act, in the House’s passage of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization. Stefanik’s provisions provide support for the Plattsburgh International Airport by designating it as a Port of Entry.

“For years, I have worked to ensure that Plattsburgh International Airport is equipped with the resources it needs to continue meeting the transportation needs of families in Upstate New York and the North Country, and to continue providing access for tourists visiting our region. With the passage of the FAA Reauthorization today, I am proud to have secured the inclusion of my bipartisan bill designating Plattsburgh Airport as a Port of Entry and delivering this result for my constituents,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik.

"We went to Washington with Mark Henry, Clinton County Legislature Chair, in May to make the case for full Customs Port of Entry status at Plattsburgh International Airport,"stated Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce."Congresswoman Stefanik pledged her active support and she has delivered approval by the House just two months later. We thank her for understanding the importance of this move to the future of the airport, saving resources that can support other needs at the airport, guaranteeing full customs services into the future which will ultimately bring more activity and growth, and treating Plattsburgh equally with so many other airports with this status. We will continue to work with Senators Schumer and Gillibrand toward similar Senate action and are hopeful success will be achieved by later this year. Onward and upward!"

“Once again, Congresswoman Stefanik has demonstrated her commitment to getting the Plattsburgh International Airport designated as a Port of Entry,”stated Robert Hall, Plattsburgh International Airport Committee Chairperson."This designation just makes sense and has been a long time coming. We applaud the passage of this bill and we thank our Senators for their efforts as well; we are hopeful that they are equally as successful as Congresswoman Stefanik.”

The Plattsburgh International Airport is one of only two primary commercial service airports in close proximity to the Northern or Southern Border designated as user-fee airports, which requires the airports to pay out of pocket for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) services, such as security screenings, cargo security and examinations, and immigration inspections. This designation change will save the Plattsburgh International Airport roughly $600,000 per year.

In April, StefanikintroducedtheBorder Airport Enhancement Actto designate Plattsburgh International Airport as a Port of Entry and terminate its status as a user-fee airport.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik on U.S. Government Interference In The 2020 Election: "This was Illegal Government Censorship To Protect And Prop Up Joe Biden."
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— At the hearing of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik slammed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for illegally censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story to interfere with the results of the 2020 election.

Stefanik citednational pollingwhich concludes that a majority of Americans, including Democrats, would have changed their 2020 vote if they had been aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story.

Watch her line of questioning here.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below:

Congresswoman Stefanik: “Ms. Morris, isn't it true that your October 2020 Hunter Biden laptop from hell story, has proven to be 100 percent factually accurate?”

Ms. Morris: “I was 27 when I published that story. It better have been.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “Isn’t it true that the FBI obtained Hunter Biden’s laptop a full 10 months before your story broke?”

Ms. Morris: “That's correct according to the subpoena that I published.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: Isn’t it also true that we now know that the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force coerced social media companies into an alleged forthcoming Russian quote, ‘Hack and leak’ operation and as a result, illegally censored the Hunter Biden laptop story. Isn’t that true?

Ms. Morris: “Yes.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And this for censorship by government agencies, like the FBI, was paid for by the taxpayer, since the taxpayers fund the FBI, isn’t that true?”

Ms. Morris: “Yes.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And Hunter Biden’s laptop from hell, it has everything. It’s a hell hole and cesspool of corruption and criminal conduct. It has hard drugs, prostitution, pornography, money laundering, it has Biden Family shell companies, Communist Chinese, corrupt foreign government deals from tens of millions of dollars in exchange for access to the Biden Family. The Hunter Biden laptop from hell has all of this, correct?”

Ms. Morris: “Yeah.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And the American people are smart. They know that this was not a hack and dump. This was illegal government censorship to protect and prop up Joe Biden on the eve of the 2020 election, and according topolling, of people who are now made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story, 53 percent would have changed their vote, including 61 percent of Democrats. So do you agree that the censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story was determinative in the 2020 election, Ms. Morris?”

Ms. Morris: “Yeah. There are various polls that say that there would have been a change in the outcome of the election and obviously it’s immediately relevant to a decision on who to vote for, so obviously.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And do you believe that this government censorship was election interference?”

Ms. Morris: “Yes. Any censorship of speech prevents your ability to think clearly. Yes, of course, yes.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And Mr. Kennedy, I want to turn to you. You’ve heard me lay out this example of egregious and illegal government censorship. You have been censored yourself. Do you believe that government censorship is a form of election interference?”

Mr. Kennedy: “I think democracy is dependent on the free flow of information, and if that information is distorted, if the public is lied to, then it interferes with elections and by the way it interferes with public health. And the Wall Street Journal did an article a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that the censorship of important health information cost American lives.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “And Mr. Kennedy, I want to ask you specifically about the Hunter Biden laptop story. The total blackout on all social media outlets as well as telecom, you couldn’t text the link to the Hunter Biden laptop story. This specifically was a form of election interference by the U.S. government in the 2020 election.”

Mr. Kennedy: “I don’t know enough about it. I know that there was censorship on that story and other stories that presumably could have changed people’s minds about the election.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “We know the polling demonstrates that now, people have said they would have changed their vote had they been made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Isn’t that correct?”

Mr. Kennedy: “I am not aware of that, but I’m not surprised.”

Congresswoman Stefanik: “Mr. Sauer, I want to turn to you. I want your reflection on this form of government censorship, specifically in the 2020 election, as a form of election interference and what I believe is some of the most egregious political scandals that, you know, I will live through in my lifetime. Mr. Sauer, what are your reflections?”

Mr. Sauer: “I strongly agree with your characterization of that form of censorship as election interference. The evidence in our case strongly supports that. It strongly supports, actually we have judicial findings now, that the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story was done at the instigation of federal officials in the FBI, at a very high level of that organization. It was an orchestrated campaign of deception that was anticipatory, it was planned in advance, and it was, I think, consummated with the testimony that I hadn’t seen before that’s been put out today from Ms. Dehmlow characterizing how at the very end, the FBI then clammed up at the last minute after spending months of seeding the record in these endless, ceaseless meetings with social media platforms about, ‘there’s a hack and dump coming, it’s gonna involve Hunter Biden,’ then when it actually came they said, ‘whoop, no comment.’ Our judge focused on that particular issue. It’s kind of the coup de grâce in this form of election interference.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: Reaffirms House Republicans' Support For Israel
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues in welcoming Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to Congress to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Israel’s statehood and partnership with America.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Well, thank you all for coming today. What a historic and wonderful speech we just heard from President Isaac Herzog. It is my honor and pleasure, on behalf of the House Republican Conference and Speaker McCarthy, to welcome Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to Congress today to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Israel’s statehood. As one of our strongest allies, closest friends, and only democracy in the Middle East, Israel’s special relationship with the United States is and forever will be crucial especially as our adversaries are increasingly emboldened around the world due to Joe Biden’s weakness on the global stage.

Since 1948, Israel has remained resilient in the face of its opposition and oppressors as it stands as a role model for the advancement of global democracy. This May, I was honored to help lead a bipartisan House Intelligence Committee delegation to Israel to commemorate the anniversary of Israel’s sovereignty and echo our support for Israel’s’ right to defend itself.

It is disappointing and inexcusable that Democrat members of Congress use their platforms to disseminate harmful and shameful anti-Semitic rhetoric choosing to align themselves with Israel’s aggressors and Iranian backed terrorist groups. The silence from Democrat leadership is deafening. The silence from the White House is deafening. House Republicans proudly condemned anti-Semitic rhetoric yesterday, and it is telling that a number of Democrats voted ‘no’ on that resolution. In fact, today, many chose to boycott today’s address. That is shameful. It is un-American.

God bless the United States of America, and God bless Israel. I’m so proud to stand here with so many of my House Republican colleagues here today.”

Title: Stefanik Votes to Pass Schools Not Shelters Bill, Sending Clear Message that Schools Are for Educating Children and Not Housing Illegal Immigrants
Date: 2023

Content:
“Housing illegal immigrants in schools is unacceptable and irresponsible. Illegal immigrants do NOT belong in our schools. It’s the Far Left’s failed attempt to deal with the illegal immigration crisis created by radical sanctuary city policies and Biden’s border crisis,”stated Congresswoman Stefanik.“House Democrats are doing everything in their power to worsen the crisis at our borders. In contrast, House Republicans have passed the strongest border security bill ever and today, with the passage of theSchools Not Shelters Act, we are making it crystal clear that our students will always come before illegal immigrants.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced plans to house asylum seekers in up to 30 current and former public schools. Governor Kathy Hochul identified three SUNY campuses to shelter up to 1,500 migrants in dorms over the summer. In response, this legislation is sending a clear message that schools should be focused on helping students recover from devastating pandemic-era learning loss. Hosting illegal immigrants on school campuses poses a significant safety risk to school children and compromises schools' ability to secure their own campus.

Specifically, this bill applies to the facilities of (1) public elementary or secondary schools, and (2) institutions of higher education.

This prohibition does not apply to shelter or housing provided in response to certain disasters such as a fire, flood, explosion, or tornado for which there has been a disaster declaration.

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: "Joe Biden Is Compromised"
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joined Mornings With Maria Bartiromo on the Fox Business Network to discuss President Biden’s weaponization of the Department of Justice against his top political opponent and how House Republicans are delivering accountability.

Rep. Stefanik also discussed how House Republicans are countering Communist China and standing with Israel.

Watch her full remarks here.

Highlights of her interview are below:

On Joe Biden’s Weaponization of The Department of Justice:

“Look at Joe Biden’s Department of Justice, it has become an arm of the Democrat political operation, weaponized against Joe Biden’s top political opponent…And it is not a coincidence, Maria, that the same week that House Republicans are having a hearing, today actually, hearing from two IRS credible whistleblowers, highlighting the politicization of the investigation into Hunter Biden to shield the Biden family member from equal justice under the law, is the same week that Jack Smith makes this announcement. So, the American people see this for what this is, which is the weaponization, which is un-American, of the Department of Justice against Joe Biden’s political opponents.”

On House Republicans Investigations Into the Biden Family's Influence Peddling Scheme:

“Well, we have a number of tools at our disposal, Maria. So first, I want to take a step back. It’s because the Republicans are in the majority that we have uncovered all of this evidence, of the fact that Joe Biden is compromised, the fact that Hunter Biden sold access to the sitting Vice President of United States, Joe Biden, his father, and took tens of millions of dollars to the Biden family from China and Russia. This was while Joe Biden was Vice President, Maria. If Republicans were not in the majority, the American people would not know that. They would not know. They would not have heard from the IRS credible whistleblowers. So we’re going to continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead. We have every tool at our disposal: the appropriations tools, the contempt tools, and other constitutional responsibilities as Members of Congress. And you know, I am proud to stand in the breach for this fight to save this country, to save who we are as the United States of America.”

…

“Well, Maria, we will look at every option. I have always said we will use every tool at our disposal. But unlike the Democrats, we’re going to do the proper investigation, and we have great committee chairs in Jim Jordan, Jamie Comer, and Jason Smith who are conducting this hearing this week. And we will follow the evidence and continue to shine a spotlight on again the fact that the President of the United States is compromised and that there’s been criminal behavior within the Biden family.”

On Countering Communist China:

“Well, you’re exactly right, Maria. Joe Biden is weak on China. The fact that whether you have John Kerry who is, you know, basically an ambassador for this Administration, or sending Secretary Blinken, meanwhile Communist China is conducting significant cyber espionage, this recent news that there was hacking of cabinet level officials conducted by Communist China. We stand strong as Republicans, and certainly, President Trump, the leading Republican nominee, stands strong when it comes to countering Communist China. My legislation will ensure that no U.S. taxpayer dollars go towards funding any higher ed. institution that is taking money or partnerships with Communist Chinese higher ed. We’ve seen a history of Communist China trying to make inroads in our education system through their Confucius Institutes, and it was us as Republicans that banned Confucius Institutes. So we need to shield and ensure that no taxpayer dollars go towards funding Communist Chinese propaganda.”

On Condemning Rep. Jayapal’s Anti-Semitic Remarks And Standing With Israel:

“Well, look at her words. It is a vile, anti-Semitic statement, and this is becoming more and more pervasive in today’s Democrat Party, and the silence is deafening from the Democrat  leadership. House Republicans stand strongly with Israel, it’s one of our greatest and most important allies. We are honored to host the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, for a joint session address. It’s a high honor, and it also comes on the heels of Speaker McCarthy delivering a speech at the Knesset when he visited Israel. I just came back from a CODEL in Israel Congressional Delegation, I helped lead that just a few months ago, and we need to continue to strengthen our relationship. But it is Democrats who have anti-Semitism within their caucus, and it needs to be condemned. House Republicans are proud to condemn it. Today, we’re hosting a press conference highlighting how it’s House Republicans that will always stand strongly with Israel, who, by the way, is the greatest beacon of democracy in the Middle East.”

Title: Stefanik Sends Letter to Governor Hochul Urging Full Inclusion of All Impacted Counties in FEMA Flooding Emergency Declaration
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Stefanik sent aletterto Governor Hochul, requesting that Hochul fully include all North Country and Upstate New York counties that were impacted in recent storms in her disaster declaration to FEMA. Currently, New York State’s emergency declarations do not include the full extent of the serious flooding from July 1st through July 10th.

In the letter, the Congresswoman states,“Aid to all affected is essential to a full recovery, and upstate New York and the North Country cannot be left out of this essential process. Given that your initial request to FEMA neglected to include the July 1st and 2nd events, I strongly urge you to update that request to include a full, not just partial, accounting of the recent storms and flooding, for Clinton, Essex, and Hamilton. I request you work to move forward with a process that is closely coordinated with those who are on the front lines of this recovery effort.”

Congresswoman Stefanik has been in touch with local officials and residents who were severely impacted by the storm and have seen the devastation firsthand as they work to coordinate the recovery.

“I believe it is critical for the State of New York to work to ensure full restoration for all families, businesses, and neighborhoods affected by these disasters,”Congresswoman Stefanik states.

“Clinton County suffered overwhelming damage to a significant portion of our infrastructure throughout the course of this multiday flooding event. The widespread flash flooding across our region is unlike any we have seen before. While we remain grateful that no injuries have been reported due to the floods, the devastating impact to town, county and state roads as well as significant destruction to personal properties, will take a significant amount of time and capital to restore. We applaud the Congresswoman’s efforts to extend the dates on the Governor’s request to FEMA to include the previous flooding,”stated Mark Henry, Chairman of Clinton County Legislature.

"In the late evening hours of July 1st, The Town of Dannemora started getting an unprecedented rainfall event which, when the heavy rain stopped falling hours later, left several of our roads unpassable and private properties severely damaged. The damage may seem minimal to some due to our size and population, but that is also why it is so devastating - we have a small tax base with a small budget and have already spent tens of thousands to get our roads passable, not to mention what private citizens have spent. Additionally, the State and County roads within our town have been devastated, and it will be a major push for all of us to get the roads repaired and paved before the first snowfall,”stated Deborah Coryer, Supervisor, Town of Dannemora.

Congresswoman Stefanik released astatementin response to the flooding in NY-21, calling for the expansion of the State of Emergency for Clinton, Essex, and Hamilton Counties Covering July 1st through July 11th.

Title: Stefanik Releases Statement on Passage of Resolution Condemning Anti-Semitism and Supporting Israel
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Congresswoman Stefanik released the following statement after the House passage of Representative Pfluger’sresolutioncondemning anti-Semitism and supporting the State of Israel:

“Today I voted to condemn anti-Semitism and express my unequivocal support for the State of Israel - America’s closest and most critical ally and friend. In light of the vile and widespread anti-Semitic comments made by numerous prominent Democrats in the House, the passage of this resolution demonstrates that House Republicans are united in standing with Israel. For 75 years, Israel has represented democracy and freedom. I proudly stand with my colleagues to condemn anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements that have no place in our national rhetoric.”

Title: ICYMI: Stefanik: "Accountability is here."
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.— Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her colleagues highlighted how House Republicans are delivering on our commitment to a government that’s accountable by rooting out the corruption inside Joe Biden's federal agencies.

Watch her full remarks here.

View the full transcript of her remarks below:

“Last week, the mainstream media once again underestimated the House Republican majority. And we once again delivered results for the American people, passing a strong National Defense Authorization Act. The American people are fed up with the radical, Far Left and failed policies of Joe Biden and House Democrats.

I also want to comment on the breaking news. We have, yet again, another example of Joe Biden’s weaponized Department of Justice targeting his top political opponent, Donald Trump. And this week, I want to highlight our oversight work on this two-tiered, fundamentally un-American system of justice. We will be hearing from credible IRS whistleblowers who have provided evidence showing how the Department of Justice interfered into the investigation into Hunter Biden with a delay, divulge, and deny campaign that ultimately shielded and protected him. There cannot be one set of laws if your last name is Biden and another set of laws for law abiding Americans. As I said, this is a two-tiered system of justice that is fundamentally un-American.

We will also have a hearing later this week on the Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government to examine the federal government's role in censoring Americans and focus on the Missouri v. Biden case and Big Tech's collusion with out-of-control government agencies to silence speech of Americans.

Accountability is here, and House Republicans are committed to rooting out the corruption inside Joe Biden's federal agencies.

On the House floor, legislatively, we have a robust agenda. We’ll be voting on key legislation ensuring America’s aviation superiority through the FAA Reauthorization Act, and we’ll be keeping illegals out of our children’s schools through the Schools Not Shelters Act.

We are also honored to welcome friend and long-standing ally, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, to Congress tomorrow to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Israel’s statehood. My House Republican colleagues and I look forward to hearing from President Herzog and continuing our strong work advocating for Israel and its people. This is in stark contrast to the vile, anti-Semintic comments you hear coming out from some of the prominent leaders within the Democrat Caucus. Every member should condemn those statements of Representative Jayapal.”

Title: Stefanik's Bipartisan Veterans' Access to VA Benefits Bill Featured at House Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs held a legislative hearing on Congresswoman Stefanik’s bipartisan legislation, the Ernest Peltz Accrued Veterans Benefits Act, which would improve the process of issuing pension benefits payments administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

"I have worked for years with the Peltz family, our great veterans service organizations, the VA, as well as Members of this Committee on crafting this legislation to ensure no other family has to endure what the Peltz family went through when WWII veteran and hero Ernest Peltz passed away,"stated Congresswoman Stefanik.

Congresswoman Stefanik's Testimony

“In the midst of losing my father, my family was forced to deal with much added stress due to the VA’s error. Since we brought our concerns to Congresswoman Stefanik, she has been a tireless advocate for our family in mitigating the federal bureaucracy of the VA. This bill is an honor to my father’s legacy and the legacy of countless other veterans; a bill to ensure that veteran families will not have to go through the hurdles we were forced to when mourning the loss of a loved one. That Elise has kept working for this bill over these past years is a testament to her deep commitment to all of us,"stated Charles Peltz, son of World War II veteran Ernest Peltz.

"The VFW supports the Ernest Peltz Accrued Veterans Benefits Act, which would ensure VA pension benefits are paid out for the entire month when a veteran passes away. By receiving the full month of death payment, survivors would be able to better manage financial hardships that come with a veteran's passing,"stated Kristina Keenan, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.

Stefanik introduced this legislation after working with Charles Peltz, whose father, World War II veteran Mr. Ernest Peltz, passed away after being approved for his accrued pension benefit. However, due to a VA processing error, the VA did not deposit the approved funds in Mr. Peltz’s bank account until after his passing. The VA then removed these funds from Mr. Peltz’s account, even though he was alive when his benefit was approved, leaving his family to deal with all expenses related to his care.

This bill improves the process of issuing pension benefits payments administered by the VA that are impacted by the death of the beneficiary. It would ensure that veterans receive their accrued pension benefit in the event of a month of death-claim, or if payment for the month of the death has been issued.

The bill is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the National Military Family Association.

Title: Stefanik, Banks Introduce HALT our Adversaries Act
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Congressman Jim Banks (R-IN), senior members of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the Halting Academic Liaisons To (HALT) our Adversaries Act to ensure U.S. taxpayer dollars do not contribute to the advancement or modernization of the militaries of Communist China or the Russian Federation.

“I am working to protect U.S. taxpayer dollars from benefitting adversarial militaries in Communist China or Russia,”Congresswoman Stefanik stated.“Make no mistake: these are our foreign adversaries, and my legislation will halt taxpayer funds going to colleges and universities who in any way contribute to the military capabilities of Communist China and Russia. The threat posed by Communist China and Russia continues to grow as they enhance their capabilities and engage in malign activities around the world. I will continue to ensure the U.S. taxpayer dollars do not supplement those efforts and that we continue to maintain our military superiority.”

“We have seen far too many examples of intellectual property theft and espionage to allow university partnerships with foreign adversaries. The cutting-edge research being done at schools like Purdue in my home state of Indiana gives our defense industry an unmatched advantage that we cannot risk exposing to China and other bad actors,"stated Congressman Banks.

“This critical legislation prevents universities receiving taxpayer funds from doing business with Russia or China. Doing so will help protect critical US investments in research that could make it into the hands of US adversaries,"stated Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Action.

First,this legislation would require the Department of Defense (DoD) to identify Chinese and Russian universities providing support to the People’s Liberation Army or Russian Armed Forces and add those entities to a DoDlistof malign actors. Then, it would prohibit federal funding to U.S. colleges and universities that maintain relationships with these universities engaged in a host of adversarial activities.

Second,this legislation would prohibit the Intelligence Community from providing funding to any U.S. college or university that maintains a partnership with a Chinese military company operating in the U.S., or with any Chinese university that maintains a partnership with a CCP-aligned company.

Third,this legislation would prohibit U.S. institutions of higher education from receiving federal funding if these colleges or universities maintain partnerships with any entity controlled by Communist China.

Title: Stefanik Votes to Pass National Defense Authorization Act Through House
Date: 2023

Content:
“As the leading advocate for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, I proudly voted to secure initiatives to protect and strengthen the Fort Drum community, fully equip our troops, increase our military readiness, and support the families of Servicemembers in our district. Over the past year, I have worked in a bipartisan manner to give Upstate New York and the North Country a seat at the highest levels throughout this entire process,”Congresswoman Stefanik said.“The United States must never fall behind in providing for a strong national defense. The provisions in this NDAA invest in emerging technologies, secure supply chains of critical components for our military platforms, and ensure military readiness to meet our national security needs. This is critical to promoting peace through strength to deter the rapidly evolving military threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. For these reasons, I proudly advanced a defense bill that puts taxpayer dollars to good use by strengthening our military and providing a well-deserved pay raise to our brave men and women in uniform as they work to keep us safe.”

The FY 2024 NDAA authorizes $886.3 billion for national defense, an increase of $28 billion over the FY 2023 funding level and it authorizes funding for over $2 billion in service chief and combatant commander priorities that have been left unfunded by Biden’s budget.

Strengthening Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division

Fighting for Wins for Upstate New York and the North Country

Supporting Our Servicemembers and Their Families

Confronting the CCP and Foreign Adversaries

Keeping Pace with Emerging Technologies in the 21st Century

Strengthening National Defense

Next, the House-passed NDAA will be reconciled with the Senate-passed version in a Conference Committee. This final version will be voted on by both chambers of Congress before it is sent to the President to be signed into law.

“In light of the flooding causing tremendous damage in my district, I am calling on New York State to expand the State of Emergency for Clinton, Essex, and Hamilton Counties to cover July 1st through July 11th in order to strengthen our ability to deliver needed federal funds through FEMA. Following my conversations with local and county officials, it is clear Governor Hochul must update the emergency declaration to accurately reflect the fulsome dates and catastrophic impacts of this rainfall and flooding in the North Country.

“The flooding has resulted in widespread infrastructure and property damage as well as a major disruption of access to basic necessities for my constituents. This dire situation must be addressed immediately by New York State so that the threshold is met to ensure my office can work to deliver federal funds to begin the recovery."

I’m proud to take action on behalf of the Peltz family and all our veteran families to work to cut through the bureaucracy our veterans face,”said Congresswoman Stefanik.“I am proud to introduce this legislation to honor the legacy of World War II veteran Mr. Ernest Peltz and take one step forward in improving the effectiveness of an agency infamous for regulatory red tape.”

“When someone signs up to wear the uniform, America’s promise is that we will have their back for the rest of their life.

EXCLUSIVE: Top Republican and mother calls Biden 'heartless, selfish, and cowardly' for refusing to acknowledge his seventh grandchild after Hunter Biden settled with the baby mama

By: Kelly Laco

July 6th, 2023

House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik is blasting President Joe Biden for failing to acknowledge his seventh grandchild - son Hunter's four-year-old daughter Navy Joan - following the conclusion of a heated legal battle with the child's baby mama.

Stefanik, who proudly proclaims herself as the 'newest mom' in Congress, told DailyMail.com that the president should have acknowledged Navy Joan years ago.

'Every American knows that Joe Biden should have done the right thing years ago and acknowledged ALL of his grandchildren,' said Stefanik, R-N.Y.

'It is cold, heartless, selfish, and cowardly that the President of the United States can't show love or compassion to his beautiful granddaughter. America sees this for what it is - an inexcusable disgrace.'

Hunter Biden's baby mama settled their bitter child support suit after the First Son promised to meet their out-of-wedlock daughter and play a role in her life, DailyMail.com exclusively revealed last week.

Years of legal wrangling ended abruptly this week when Lunden Roberts, 32, agreed to slash Hunter's $20,000 monthly payments and drop her petition to have Navy Joan's last name changed to Biden.

Sources say the stunning reversal comes after Hunter told Roberts in private talks that he wanted to end hostilities and 'build a relationship' with the adorable four-year-old.

The pact also paves the way for Navy Joan to eventually meet the rest of the Biden brood - including President Joe and First Lady Jill - for the first time.

While financial details of the settlement remain under seal, court filings indicate that the fledgling artist Hunter, 53, will let his daughter pick out one of his paintings each month as a gift.

But the White House is still refusing to acknowledge the child as family.

During the White House press briefing Wednesday, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shut down a question on whether Biden would now acknowledge four-year-old Navy Joan as his grandchild after the child support dispute settlement.

'I don't have anything to share from here,' Jean-Pierre said at the briefing as she moved on to the next question.

The pre-school age girl has never met Hunter and the Biden family has refused to count her as part of the family - with only six stockings representing the grandchildren being hung at the White House at Christmastime.

The New York Times reported Friday that aides have been told that Bidens have six grandchildren - not seven - during strategy sessions.

The blonde-haired little girl was conceived around December 2017 while Hunter was still in a relationship with his brother Beau's widow, Hallie.

'I had no recollection of our encounter,' Hunter wrote in his memoir about the matter. 'That's how little connection I had with anyone. I was a mess, but a mess I've taken responsibility for.

Stefanik has been a vocal proponent of protecting the life of the unborn.

'As the newest mom in Congress, I gave birth to my son Sam almost two years ago,' she told DailyMail.com last month.

'I know how important it is to stand up and protect the most precious and vulnerable among us, that is the unborn,' she said at an event marking the one year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, rolling back landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade.

Title: Stefanik, Stanton Introduce Canadian Snowbird Visa Act
Date: 2023

Content:
“Our neighbors to the north provide more visits to the United States than any other country, and they are critically important to North Country tourism and industry,”said Congresswoman Stefanik.“Providing Canadians who own homes and property in the United States with extra time to visit and boost our economy will help revive Canadian tourism to the United States after an unprecedented closure of the Northern Border.”

“Snowbirds - seasonal visitors attracted by Arizona’s warm weather - spend more than a billion dollars in our state every year,”said Congressman Stanton.“Allowing Canadian visitors to enjoy all that Arizona has to offer for even longer is good for local businesses, and means their dollars are reinvested here in our communities.”

"Now that the border is back to normal, our Canadian friends are back spending time in the U.S.,"said Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce."Many spend extended time here. We love having them and the longer they visit, the greater the economic benefit to the U.S. So, we remain strongly supportive of this legislation, and we thank Congresswoman Stefanik for continuing to be its champion in the House."

Current law limits the amount of time a Canadian visitor may spend in the United States to 182 days per year. The Canadian Snowbird Visa Act will allow Canadian citizens over the age of 50 who either own or rent a residence in the United States to remain in the country for up to 240 days each year. The bill prohibits these individuals from working for United States employers or seeking public assistance while in the United States, and clarifies that they will retain their nonresident tax status.

Canadian visitors provide a substantial economic boost to communities throughout our country, spending over $20 billion in the United States in 2019. In New York, nearly 4 million Canadians visit the Empire State Building a year, spending $1.5 billion.

This legislation is cosponsored by Reps. Bergman (R-MI), Castor (D-FL), Lesko (R-AZ), Foster (D-IL), Carter (R-GA), Quigley (D-IL), Rutherford (R-FL), Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Mast (R-FL), and Schweikert (R-AZ).

Title: Stefanik and Malliotakis Lead Letter to Hochul Requesting Veto of State Housing Bills that would Devastate Housing Market
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C. -Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led a letter with Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) and the New York Congressional Delegation requesting that New York State Governor Kathy Hochul veto the recently-passed State Senate and Assembly bills, A.4047B / S.2943B and A.6216B / S.2980C that would devastate the housing market. These bills seek to circumvent New York State Court of Appeals precedent and significantly expand retroactivity for landlord liability in a handout to trial lawyers.

In the letter, the lawmakers state,“While this matter may seem narrow in scope, making this policy retroactive will have a wide-ranging and immediate impact on the residential real estate industry, housing stock, the regional banking sector, and the broader economy while “benefitting” mostly affluent tenants predominantly in core Manhattan neighborhoods. This legislation would enable class action lawyers and professional activists to challenge the rent levels of regulated apartments that have already undergone years of litigation and administrative orders, including periods of deregulation when tenants agreed to higher rent levels.”

Stefanik contends that if Hochul signs the legislation, the economic consequences will be severe because New York will inevitably rely on Washington to safeguard depositors and shore up the economy as the far-reaching repercussions of this legislation unfold throughout the state and the region.

“These bills do not generate new housing or make housing more affordable to either economically distressed tenants or any new entrants to the rental market. Your veto would avoid the inevitable economic chaos and requests for federal assistance that this legislation would provoke. We strongly urge you to veto this legislation in order to cause further damage to the state’s housing supply and market,”the lawmakers state.

Title: Stefanik Releases Statement on SCOTUS's Ruling that Biden Student Loan Bailout is Unconstitutional
Date: 2023

Content:
Washington, D.C.–Congresswoman Elise Stefanik released the following statement in response to the Supreme Court striking down the Biden Administration’s debt-forgiveness program in a 6-3 decision.

“Today, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of our hard-working taxpayers who would have had to carry a tremendous financial burden because of the Biden Administration’s unconstitutional student loan bailout. Biden’s student loan scam would have cost American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and placed a burden on the 100 million Americans who never went to college, while transferring wealth to those who willingly took on, and have yet to pay off, their debt.

This decision is a victory for hard-working Americans, many of whom struggle to make ends meet and cannot afford to bear the weight of additional financial pressure in the midst of major economic hardship.”
