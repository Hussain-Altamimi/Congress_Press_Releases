Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Issues Statement on the Republican-led House Abandoning Its Promise to the American People
Date: Washington, March 6, 2024
Tags: Congress

Content:
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement on the Republican-led House abandoning its promise to the American people:“When Republicans took the majority in the House, we swore we would never pass a Continuing Resolution (CR) and we swore we would never pass minibusses. Yet here we are under Speaker Johnson, three CRs later, a minibus, and another minibus on the horizon next week.I voted NO on today's minibus.I want to keep the pledge this Republican-led House made to the American people when we took the majority. I also refuse to fund Joe Biden’s Department of Injustice which has been weaponized to target and persecute his top political opponent, non-violent political protestors who walked the Capitol grounds on January 6th, pro-life activists, Catholics attending Latin Mass, school boards, and concerned parents.The spending level of today's minibus is higher than what was agreed upon under Speaker McCarthy. And this bill didn't just increase spending, it gave Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer everything they wanted on their wish list, and that is something I'll always refuse to vote for.Republicans should've done what we said we were going to do. We should've passed an open rule and allowed Members to offer amendments. We should've let the Representatives of the American people decide the will of the House on each of our twelve appropriations bills and passed them individually.Republicans have no excuse for having brought this minibus forward when we could have passed our single-subject appropriations bills and kept our promise to the American people.”

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces the Matthew Lawrence Perna Act of 2024
Date: Washington, March 1, 2024
Tags: Congress, Sponsored & Cosponsored Legislation

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is proudly introducing the Matthew Lawrence Perna Act of 2024, named in honor of Matthew Perna, a victim of the cruel and unusual treatment inflicted by Joe Biden’s Department of Injustice, tragically leading to his untimely death.

This vital legislation is a critical step in ensuring that the political persecution witnessed in the aftermath of January 6th is curtailed by the law. The Matthew Lawrence Perna Act enacts several essential reforms, including:

The punitive and unconstitutional treatment of January 6th defendants by Biden’s Department of Injustice exposes a deeply flawed two-tiered justice system weaponized against American citizens. With 1,314 individuals charged so far, Matthew Graves is set to charge one per day this year, highlighting the unjust targeting of peaceful protestors. At the same time, violent Antifa and BLM criminals remain on the streets and evade accountability.

“Having personally witnessed the abuses in the DC jail, where patriotic Americans are left to suffer by the very government meant to protect them, it is evident that reform is urgently needed,”stated Congresswoman Greene.

Matthew Perna's tragic death serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of unchecked government brutality. His life could have been spared if not for the relentless persecution by the Biden regime.

The Matthew Lawrence Perna Act is a beacon of hope, ensuring that Matthew did not perish in vain and holding the Biden regime accountable for its crimes against American citizens.

This bill was originally introduced in the 117th Congress by former Congressman Louie Gohmert, Congresswoman Greene was the only co-sponsor of the legislation. Now, the sole sponsor of this bill in the 118th Congress, Congresswoman Greene urges all of her colleagues to sign on as a co-sponsor and ensure no non-violent political protestor is ever treated with such inhumanity in the United States ever again.

Title: Resolution to Censure Ilhan Omar Introduced by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a resolution to censure Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for her recent treasonous statements. The resolution, which highlights Omar's violation of her oath of allegiance to the United States, condemns her actions as detrimental to national security and against the principles of patriotism.In her remarks at an event in Minneapolis on January 27, 2024, Omar openly admitted to advocating for the interests of Somalia over those of the United States. She stated, "The U.S. Government will only do what Somalians in the U.S. tell them to do... Sleep in comfort knowing I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside the U.S. system."The resolution emphasizes that Omar's actions directly contradict the oath of allegiance she took upon becoming a citizen of the United States. Furthermore, it underscores the warnings of George Washington against the dangers of "pretended patriotism" and emphasizes the importance of loyalty to the United States above all else."Ilhan Omar needs to be censured. I urge my colleagues to vote to censure her, but also urge my colleagues that we need to join together to stop foreign agents serving in our government, in the interests of foreign countries,”stated Congresswoman Greene.“We serve the United States of America, and that's it. We serve the American people and no other people. That's how our country needs to get back on track. And that's the only way we'll save our country."If passed, the resolution calls for the censure of Ilhan Omar and her public appearance in the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure. Additionally, after being removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the beginning of the 118thCongress, this resolution goes further by stripping Omar of her remaining committee assignments by removing her from the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene urges all Members of Congress to uphold their oath to protect and defend the United States Constitution by supporting this resolution.Watch Congresswoman Greene’s remarks on the House floorhere.Read the full resolutionhere.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Legislation to Reinstate Pilots Fired by COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates and Defend Medical Freedom
Date: Washington, December 6, 2023
Tags: Health, Congress, Sponsored & Cosponsored Legislation

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene proudly introduced legislation aimed at reinstating pilots who were unjustly fired or forced to resign due to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The bill, co-led by Senator Marshall, seeks to rectify the injustices faced by pilots who chose to prioritize their personal health choices over coercive mandates.Over the past several years, many pilots have found themselves forced out of their livelihoods for the simple act of refusing to get the COVID vaccine. These professionals, who ensure the smooth and safe functioning of the commercial American aviation industry, were denied the basic medical freedom to decide whether to take the experimental vaccine or face termination.While witnessing the distressing scenes of pilots being compelled to take the vaccine against their will, we also observed the courage of those who stood against these tyrannical mandates—pilots who, regrettably, faced the consequence of losing their jobs for their principled stance. Congresswoman Greene emphasizes the urgent need to address this infringement on the rights of these dedicated professionals.Congresswoman Greene expressed her commitment to restoring justice for the affected pilots, stating,"I am proud to co-lead this bill with Senator Marshall to bring justice to the pilots who were forced out of their livelihoods for bravely refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. These pilots were denied their medical freedom and lost their jobs because of the tyrannical mandates. This bill will hold airlines accountable by requiring them to reinstate those pilots who were unjustly fired."Today, Senator Marshall, alongside Senator Braun, introduced the Senate companion bill for this legislation.Congresswoman Greene urges her colleagues in the House and the Senate to rally behind this vital initiative, ensuring the restoration of justice for pilots who have valiantly defended their right to medical autonomy.Read the full text of Congresswoman Greene’s legislationhere.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene PASSES Amendment on House Floor to FIRE Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene PASSED an amendment on the House floor to FIRE Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.Pothole Pete staged fake bike rides to the White House and used private planes funded by taxpayers to receive awards for the way certain people have sex.American taxpayers should not be on the hook for paying for his lavish trips or his salary.Watch Congresswoman Greene's remarks on the House floorhere.

RUSHED TRANSCRIPTION:Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneMy amendment uses the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Secretary Pete Buttigieg to $1 Pete Buttigieg has failed to serve the American people as the Secretary of Transportation.He has been busy calling roads racist and forcing equity action plans and implementing climate change initiatives.Rather than strengthening our nation's transportation infrastructure systems and responding to emergencies like the train derailment in East Palestine.He stated there is racism physically built into some of our highways.Every transportation decision is inherently in many ways a decision about equity.I would argue people driving on dirt roads every single day in rural America may feel that way.But our Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, doesn't care about Americans in rural America, he's more interested in declaring that roads are built on skin color and racism, and shirring.He also stated ensuring equity and accessibility for every member of the traveling public is one of the Department of Transportation's highest priorities.Again, I'll point to rural America.In the same month, he was sworn in his department introduced racial equities and barriers to opportunities as a consideration for awarding discretionary grants as if that's how fun should be awarded.In June 2022, he launched a $1 billion pilot program aimed at helping reconnect cities and neighborhoods racially segregated or divided by road projects.Under this program, over $100 million, was awarded to tear down and rebuild a freeway in Detroit because it was considered racially divisive. taxpayer dollars are being used to cover 80% of the project's funds.He has also intentionally tried to deceive the American people as shown when a video surfaced of him faking a bike ride to a White House Cabinet meeting.The video showed Secretary Buttigieg driving to the White House but stopping and just enough time for his security detail to unload his bike from the back of the gas guzzling SUV.He then rode his bike for the cameras to the White House, as if he had been riding it all along.What a hypocrite What a liar, deserving and taxpayer funded pay check is about job performance, not about personalities or identity politics.And let's all recall that Pete Buttigieg was formerly a mayor and was well known as pothole Pete for not repairing all the potholes in the roads in the town that he served.So I assure you this is about defunding his paycheck to $1, which I think is $1 too high for a secretary of transportation that is failing the American people when it comes to transportation while implementing his tyrannical climate agenda through his office and preaching for the government to curb carbon emissions.Pete Buttigieg, has reportedly taken at least 18 taxpayer funded flights on private jets managed by the FAA.One of these flights was taken to receive an award from the Canadian gay rights organization for advancing LGBTQ rights.American taxpayers don't want to pay for Pete Buttigieg to get awards for the way people have sex.That's not what the Secretary of Transportation should be doing.These fraudulent actions of Secretary Buttigieg illustrate that he is not to be trusted in leading our Department of Transportation, while Secretary Buttigieg was taking taxpayer funded carbon emitting private jets to receive LGBTQ awards.He failed to serve the Americans in East Palace Steen who were devastated by the train derailment and chemical spill earlier this year.In response to why he hadn't visited the community.He stated that he would visit when the time is right.It turns out the time was only right after President Trump visited brought 1000s of bottles of water and pressured Secretary Buttigieg into visiting ha and maybe doing his job.It took our Secretary of Transportation almost three weeks to visit after this unbelievable toxic catastrophe.Furthermore, under his watch his secretary the FAA was forced to order a ground stop for all air traffic in the US due to a system outage.This was the first time in history.The NOTAM system had has ever failed and it was the first time since 9/11.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Issues Statement Following No Vote on Israel Aid Package
Date: Washington, November 2, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued a statement on her support for Israel, their statehood, and the right to defend themselves in the manner they choose and why she ultimately voted no to tonight's aid package to Israel, unapologetically demanding America’s border be Congress's first priority.

While Congresswoman Greene voted no on this particular aid package, the Congresswoman is proud to have a history of voting to fund Israel's Iron Dome and other defense systems. That's why the Congresswoman urges the Senate to take up the House's already passed Defense and State and Foreign Ops bills which already contain $3.8 billion for Israel. As soon as Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats take up these bills and send them to the White House, Joe Biden can sign them into law.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneToday I took a hard vote as a Christian who supports Israel.

I voted no to the additional funding to Israel's defense.This comes after the Republican controlled House voted for $3.8 billion for Israel's defense, weapons and replenishment of the Iron Dome.This $3.8 billion is sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk. And he and the Democrats in the Senate.\Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader in the Senate for Republicans refused to pass this bill these bills $3.8 billion that could go directly to Israel's defense.You see, the reason why I voted no today and not that I'll always be a no for Israel's defense is because I'm unapologetically America first.And today in America, we have an open border driven national security crisis.This is something we've never seen before.Tragically over in Israel on the first day when Hamas horrifically attacked innocent Israeli citizens.They killed approximately 1400 innocent women, children, babies, elderly people, people that were just going about their day.But here in America every single day 300 Americans are murdered by cartel Chinese fentanyl that comes across our border because of the Biden administration's open border policies.300 Then 600 Then 900 1200 1500 That's just in five days, but this never stops. There is no ceasefire for fentanyl.There is no stop to it 300 Americans every single day.You see we have to put our country first we have to put Americans first.I stand with Israel and I cannot explain how much I support them.I support Israel.I support their defense and I support their statehood.But I want to see America's government, our federal government, our elected office holders put the hard working American taxpayer American citizens America's border.First for once.People all over this country are suffering.The people in Lahaina the people in East Palestine.Our government never helps Americans.They always put Americans last while they prioritize foreign wars and foreign borders, and then explain and explain why more billions and billions of dollars must be sent overseas to defend these country's borders.Love, no one ever defends America's border, and our government certainly doesn't do it.This has to end this is a cycle of America last policies that must end in Washington DC, because we are living in dangerous times.Just in the past two and a half years when Joe Biden took office, the Biden administration has allowed over 10 million people to cross our border.There is over 1.8 million got aways and right now US intelligence is warning that a terrorist attack could happen any any day at any time here on our own homeland.We are on the verge of our own war within our own country. Because we have no idea how many terrorists are on our own land.I'm against the foreign policy decisions that always prioritize other country's borders before our own border.And again, I want to express that I solidly stand with Israel's defense.I solidly stand with the Israeli citizens and I solidly support Israeli statehood.You see the Biden administration has done everything to dismantle peace in the Middle East.They took away President Trump's strong pro Israel strong peace policy policies that brought peace to that entire region for the first time in decades.The Biden administration wants to control how the funding and how the how our military defense weapons are used for Israel's defense.And this is something that we cannot allow to happen.It will never matter how much money we give to Israel when Biden gets to dictate the terms.Joe Biden is demanding a ceasefire.They will demand this of Israel and not allowed Israel to defend their own country.Joe Biden will demand to keep humanity humanitarian aid open in certain paths and not let Israel Stop it while they are being continually attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah.They will We'll also tell Israel no preemptive strikes on Hezbollah, while Hezbollah is already firing rockets into Israel.You see, if we just go ahead and fund this and send this money over to the Senate, and allow the Senate and the White House VIP take the terms for Israel, it will not ever help Israel the way Israel needs help.It needs to defend themselves. Israel is a sovereign nation, they need to dictate their own terms.They need to dictate their own defense.And that's how I support Israel.Today, I'm supporting America, and I'm supporting America's border.This was a hard vote, I want to send as much helped Israel as possible.And one day I may vote to do that, if that day arises.But I'm urging all of my colleagues I'm urging everyone here in Washington, DC, to take very seriously for once our own national security crisis and the danger that our entire country is in from the open border policies of the Biden Administration.Thank you.

EXCLUSIVE: Marjorie Taylor Greene to bring resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib, accusing her of 'antisemitic activity' – Fox News

Following last week’s insurrection at the United States Capitol by Israel-hating, America-hating Jewish Voice for Peace led by Rashida Tlaib, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her intent to introduce a censure resolution against Representative Tlaib.Today, Congresswoman Greene introduced her resolution against Rep. Tlaib for antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex. “This type of Israel-hating, America-hating behavior from a sitting Member of Congress is unacceptable and she does not represent anything America stands for. That's why I'm introducing a censure resolution for Rashida Tlaib,”stated Congresswoman Greene.One of the group chats the insurrectionists used to communicate with each other in last week’s coordinated attack on our Democracy was named "Global Intifada," which means rebellion and uprising. The ADL describes Jewish Voice for Peace, the pro-Hamas Arabic rebellion and uprising group Rashida Tlaib led into Capitol, as "a radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates for a complete economic, cultural and academic boycott of the state of Israel." One of Tlaib's aggressive insurrectionists evencame after Congresswoman Greene in the Cannon buildingwhile she was broadcasting what was taking place to her social media audience.Tlaib has a history of making antisemitic remarks, including in 2019 when she said she celebrated the Holocaust and felt a “calming feeling” when thinking about the genocide of millions of Jews. In 2020, she even retweeted an illustration with the caption, “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” This Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) slogan has been adopted by Hamas and calls for the elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews. Tlaib also referred to Israel as having an “apartheid government” in September 2022.Tlaib’s hatred extends beyond Israel to the very country she claims to represent in Congress. On October 12, 2023, she blamed America for allowing the deaths of Palestinian babies at the hands of Israel. Perhaps most shockingly, Tlaib followed Hezbollah’s orders to carry out a “day of unprecedented anger” following the explosion at a Gazan hospital and lied about Israel’s responsibility for the attack, directly contradicting American intelligence agencies.Members of Congress who denounce the United States while praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold office. Rashida Tlaib must be publicly censured in the House of Representatives with total condemnation for support of terrorist organizations.Congresswoman Greene’s Censure Resolution was introduced with four original cosponsors, Rep. John Carter (TX), Rep. Mike Collins (GA), Rep. Mary Miller (IL), and Rep. Randy Weber (TX).

Title: Comer & Greene Press DOD on U.S. Military Aid and Weapons Falling into Terrorist Hands
Date: Washington, October 23, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) are opening a probe into the Department of Defense’s (DoD) processes and policies to ensure that American military aid and weapons are properly distributed and used abroad. In a letter to DoD Secretary Lloyd Austin, the lawmakers request a staff briefing after reports surfaced showing U.S.-manufactured weapons are being redistributed and resold in secondary markets to terrorist organizations, including Hamas.

“The Committee is concerned by reports that Hamas and other terrorist organizations may have obtained American-made weapons,”wrote the lawmakers.“Recently released photos show Hamas terrorists allegedly holding what appear to be M4A1 Carbines, which were specially designed for U.S. Special Operations Forces. This would not be the first time our military service members and allies have been targeted by terrorist organizations misappropriating American-made weapons."

Previously, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reportedly provided Stinger Anti-Aircraft Missiles to the Afghan Mujahideen, which were later obtained and utilized by the Taliban. More recently, the Taliban released videos and photographs in 2021 of their members flying a U.S. UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. A recent Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine report alleges that Russian intelligence has repurposed weapons seized during the Ukraine-Russia war, which were manufactured in the United States and the European Union (EU). An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commander echoed concerns in June 2023, stating that Palestinian groups in the Gaza strip possessed U.S. weapons seized by the Taliban during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.

“The Committee seeks transparency as to how the DoD ensures that military aid, including American-made small arms, are being carefully distributed, safeguarded, and tracked abroad to prevent further incidents,”continued the lawmakers.“The potential possession of U.S. weapons by terrorists is alarming in light of the terrorist group’s recent horrific attack on Israel. Therefore, the Committee seeks a staff briefing on DoD procedures for preventing, addressing, and mitigating weapon diversion abroad.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneHi, I'm proud to let you know that my amendment using the Holman rule to fire Secretary Lloyd Austin just passed on the House floor.This is the first time in the 118th Congress that we have used the Holman rule.This is the first one introduced.And as a matter of fact, it's the first time the Holman rule has been used in years.The Holman rule is a very important tool that Members of Congress can use to fire federal government officials.And Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense of the United States, definitely deserves to be fired.He failed in Afghanistan, military recruitment is at an all-time low, and he forced 8,000 military troops out of the military because they refused the COVID vaccine.There's a loss in confidence in Lloyd Austin's leadership and he deserves to be fired.So my amendment to fire him using the Holman rule, reducing his salary down to $1, and $1 is too much, just passed on the House floor.Share the good news, everyone!

Title: STATEMENT: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Rules Package Facing a Vote in the House

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene made the following statement on the Rules package facing a vote in the House:"For weeks, I’ve been asking for Ukraine funding to be a standalone vote, not cash hidden inside of other bills. For a moment, it seemed like that would happen. But it didn’t.Instead of stripping $300 million of funding to Ukraine from the DOD approps bill like House leadership promised, the Rules committee passed a package that combines multiple approps bills into a single rule.Not only will Congress be forced to vote on a rule that includes $300 million for Ukraine in America’s defense spending bill, it is now combined with a State and Foreign Ops spending bill that gives a blank check to Biden to spend in Ukraine.This means BILLIONS of your hard earned money will be at the disposal of Joe Biden, his State Department, and his DOD to be spent on his proxy war against Russia.The rule is the first step of advancing this blood money in Congress. Unfortunately, it looks like some of the House’s strongest conservatives are going to vote for the rule to help along the “process.”Voting yes on the rule means more money for Ukraine. It’s that simple. No one who wants peace should vote yes on the rule to advance the bills.That’s why I’m a HARD NO on the rules package and a blank check for Ukraine!"

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Issues Statement on Impeachment Inquiry Launched Into Joe Biden
Date: Washington, September 12, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued a statement on the Impeachment Inquiry launched into Joe Biden by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Congresswoman Greene lays out what exactly an Impeachment Inquiry means and why it's so necessary to fully expose the crimes of the Biden family and investigate every person who helped cover it up.

RUSHED TRANSCRIPTION:ReporterTo clarify, is the inquiry open right now? Are we I mean, is there a vote that's going to be taken in the House of Representatives? What are the next steps?Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThat's a great question. Because there's some confusion. There's two ways to open an impeachment inquiry, the House can take a vote, or the Speaker of the House can announce in start in open the investigation, he can open the Impeachment Inquiry, that was a precedent is set forward by former speaker of house Nancy Pelosi. And that's what he chose to do today. And I think it was a great bold move.ReporterWhere do you see this ending up? Do you see this ending and removal from office for President Biden? Do you see this going even to a Senate trial making out of the House of Representatives? What's the ceiling for this?Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneWell, what I actually want to see is I want to see a very deep dive a detailed investigation, no matter how long it takes, and it may take months and months. It may go all the way to the November election. But what we need to do is we need to investigate Joe Biden. But we also need to investigate the web of people that exist in our federal agencies, the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, and many others, serving not only in this administration, the former administration and the one before it, maybe even further, we need to find the people that have covered up Joe Biden's crimes and all of the Biden family's corruption. That's what's most important to me, because I really do believe in gutting the federal government of corruption, and this is the way we can start.ReporterFor the average person sitting at home. They see this they think maybe this is kind of close to the 2024 election. Is this. I mean, once for all, is this politically motivated?Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneAbsolutely not. It's not politically motivated at all in the American people at home know one thing that they're suffering under the Biden administration with a wide open border and invasion of illegal immigrants, over 85,000 migrant children missing, over 300 Americans dying every single day from fentanyl. They can't afford their electric bills, they can't afford their gas bills. They can't afford groceries. That's what the American people know. And they know that politicians like Joe Biden, who's been in this place in office for over 50 years have gotten richer and richer and richer every every year. They're in office, and they know why. And I'm really excited. We're doing this impeachment inquiry, because I believe we're going to expose the truth.

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the Freedom to Breathe Act, the companion to Senator J.D. Vance’s bill in the Senate, to prohibit the federal government from reimposing ineffective and draconian mask mandates on American travelers and students. America’s so-called “public health experts” pushed mask mandates on Americans knowing they didn’t work. “Dr. Fauci privately recommended not wearing a maskto his close friends, admitting they weren’t effective, yet he provided nationwide public health guidance stating Americans be required to mask in nearly all social settings, including while on public transit and in schools,”noted Greene.“Even Joe Biden himself declared the pandemic is over! We cannot allow our country to be sucked back into the COVID hysteria that ushered in unscientific and nonsensical health mandates like blanket masking policies.”Congresswoman Greene's bill is a resolute stance against unwarranted government intrusion by the Biden Administration and “public health experts,” ensuring that medical decisions remain a private matter between individuals and their physicians. This legislation:Preserves Freedom:Prohibits any federal official, including the President, from issuing orders mandating mask-wearing on passenger flights within the US national airspace system, on public transit, or within educational institutions (primary, secondary, and colleges).

Ensures Equal Access:Prevents Commercial Air Carriers, public transit authorities, and educational institutions from denying services to individuals who choose not to wear masks or other face coverings.

Prioritizes Rational Response:Bars the Secretary of Health and Human Services from mandating masks or face coverings for plane or train passengers and students during public health emergencies.

Controls Federal Spending:Restricts federal funding allocation for proposing, establishing, implementing, or enforcing mask requirements on airline and public transit passengers and students.

Promptly Implements:Mandates that all agencies issue new and revised guidance within 90 days of enactment to ensure proper implementation, preempting any conflicting laws or guidance.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene believes that preserving individual freedoms and applying sound science can go hand in hand. The Freedom to Breathe Act is a testament to this belief. “Public health experts” divided Americans and created different classes based on compliance with their mandates, backed by “science” which has been disproven time and time again. This bill aims to protect the rights and welfare of all Americans.

Upon introduction, Congresswoman Greene's bill has thirteen original cosponsors: Rep. Duncan (SC), Rep. Collins (GA), Rep. Miller (IL), Rep. Zinke (MT), Rep. Rosendale (MT), Rep. Ogles (TN), Rep. Santos (NY), Rep. Tiffany  (WI), Rep. Posey (FL), Rep. Norman (SC), Rep. Gooden (TX), Rep. Bishop (NC), and Rep. Guest (MS).

Title: STATEMENT: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Appointment of David Weiss as Special Counsel to Cover Up Hunter Biden's Criminal Career
Date: Washington, August 11, 2023
Tags: Congress

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement following today's appointment of Davis Weiss as Special Counsel to cover up Hunter Biden's criminal career:"Today’s move by Merrick Garland to appoint David Weiss as Special Counsel to investigate (and in reality cover up) Hunter Biden’s criminal career is the latest action in a continuous pattern of corrupt behavior by Joe Biden and his regime. Behavior typically only seen in juntas in third-world nations or early twentieth-century dictatorships in Europe.This is a cover-up, plain and simple. This appointment is designed to protect Joe Biden from his exposure to the serious and substantial investigation Republicans are conducting in Congress. This move establishes a firewall to protect the Biden family from their crimes of influence peddling and selling access to “The Brand,” former Vice President Joe Biden. Every subpoena, every record request, every transcribed interview, or any other effort in an impeachment inquiry will be be blocked by this corrupt and unlawful Special Counsel under the guise of an “investigation.”Republicans, including the House Oversight Committee, have revealed more information on the crimes of Joe Biden and his son in just seven short months than the corrupt DOJ, especially David Weiss, have in years. That’s exactly why this plot to obfuscate, distract, and ultimately cover-up the Biden Crime Family’s corrupt business model is unfolding before our eyes.The U.S. Attorney appointed today, David Weiss, is totally unqualified to conduct any sort of investigation into Biden crimes. Weiss has been derelict in his duty to prosecute Hunter Biden by ignoring mountains of evidence of tax fraud, evasion, and other crimes presented by brave IRS whistleblowers. Weiss has ignored mountains of evidence, most notably the famous FBI 1023 form directly linking Joe Biden to millions of dollars in payments by Burisma executives to have a Ukrainian prosecutor removed from office. And after all of this, Weiss gave Hunter Biden a sweetheart deal on serious charges where he wouldn’t face a day in prison. The entire prosecution of Hunter Biden by Weiss has been a coverup.Not only is David Weiss unqualified to conduct this “investigation,” his appointment by Garland is illegal and violates federal statute. The qualifications clearly state: “The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States government.” David Weiss is currently the U.S. Attorney for Delaware. Joe Biden’s Attorney General is breaking the law right in our face!All of this is happening while President Trump is facing criminal charge after criminal charge in a political persecution like we’ve never seen before in America. Another DOJ Special Counsel, Jack Smith, has launched an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment, on President Trump and on his supporters. This two-tiered system of injustice being rolled out in our country is designed to scare the hell out of Biden’s political opposition and force us into the shadows.If you fall in line with the regime, you won’t be punished for the most egregious crimes, but if you dare oppose the regime, your life will be ruined and you’ll be thrown behind bars. There is no clearer example than the treatment of violent and murderous BLM rioters, who had their charges dropped, compared to J6ers, who have been locked up for years.Republicans have no other choice but to stand up against this unprecedented tyrannical regime and IMPEACH.Joe Biden must be impeached. Merrick Garland must be impeached. David Weiss must be impeached. Jack Smith must be impeached. Virtually, every person in Biden’s corrupt, tyrannical regime should be impeached, convicted, and removed from office.The Democrats are playing for keeps. They are throwing every political opponent they can in jail. Soon it could be you. Republicans must use every legal tool at our disposal. We have to fight back."

Title: STATEMENT: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Politically Motivated Indictment by Special Counsel Jack Smith
Date: Washington, August 1, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement following today's politically motivated indictment of President Donald J. Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith:"Today, America finds itself in a troubling situation, resembling authoritarian regimes rather than the beacon of freedom and democracy our founders valiantly fought to establish.Innocent individuals, including former President Donald J. Trump, are being unjustly targeted by a Department of Injustice and an FBI transformed into political hitmen, acting at the behest of the sitting president.Special Counsel Jack Smith has abused his power, using his office to persecute President Trump, his aides, and ultimately, the American people. These actions are undoubtedly politically motivated, with clear intentions of interfering with the upcoming 2024 election.This isn't just an indictment against President Trump, but against all his supporters and the fundamental rights of Americans. If an innocent former president can be targeted, then no American is truly safe. President Trump is just standing in the way.That’s why I will use the Holman Rule to defund Jack Smith's special counsel, as these baseless investigations and persecutions must be put to an end. Furthermore, I have introduced articles to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland, who has weaponized the Justice Department to support these politically motivated pursuits.This is the line in the sand. This is nothing but a political assassination and I will not vote to fund a communist regime. I will not vote to fund a weaponized government while it politically persecutes not only President Trump but all conservative Americans. The Biden Department of Justice has gone rogue, and the FBI are their henchmen. Until we restore the FBI and the Department of Justice to the esteemed institutions they once were, I will not vote to fund these communist organizations that are doing the bidding of Joe Biden.My support for President Trump is unwavering. We know that this is a phony and politically motivated witch hunt aimed at undermining the core values of our nation. The American people see through these actions, and together, we must stand with President Trump and against this abuse of power."

Title: Greene, Comer Press DOJ on Mishandling of Hunter Biden Victims’ Rights
Date: Washington, July 25, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) are today pressing for information from the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to DOJ’s potential failure to uphold the rights of victims who were sexually exploited by Hunter Biden. The Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CRVA) and Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MRVA) protect victims, such as the women Hunter Biden allegedly sexually exploited based on testimony from two IRS whistleblowers, throughout the criminal process with statutory rights. In a letter to top officials at DOJ, the lawmakers seek information related to DOJ’s conduct involving the victims, including why it chose to forgo particular charges and pursue crimes that could preclude victims from receiving relief under the law.“DOJ appears to have ignored its own policies by only charging Hunter Biden with two misdemeanor tax charges. But more disturbing, the Committee is concerned DOJ disregarded the victims who were sexually exploited by Hunter Biden. Specifically, Congressional testimony indicates that Hunter Biden paid prostitutes—victims—and used such payments as tax expenses for one of his companies. These testimonies also indicated DOJ was investigating Hunter Biden for Mann Act violations,”the lawmakers wrote.Following transcribed interviews made public by the House Ways and Means Committee, two IRS whistleblowers who investigated Hunter Biden’s evasion of taxes on his $8.3 million in income exposed the Department of Justice’s politicization and misconduct during the investigation before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability in ahearing last week. During the hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene examined how Hunter Biden violated the Mann Act by deducting payments to prostitutes as tax expenses in 2018.“Based on this testimony, it appears Hunter Biden concealed illegal payments to prostitutes—victims—by claiming business expenses through one of his companies. Put simply, Hunter Biden’s criminal conduct harmed these women, and such harm appears to involve the 2018 tax charge for which he is now pleading guilty,”the lawmakers continued.“Additionally, the Committee is concerned about the narrow scope of the charges that the DOJ chose to bring despite available evidence to other, more serious crimes. The limited charging decisions may directly affect the victims’ ability to obtain relief. In choosing to ignore more severe criminal charges or omit relevant offense conduct, the DOJ opted to leave victims out of the conversation—a statutory right under the CVRA.”Read the letter to Ms. Hilary Axam, National Human Trafficking Coordinator, and Ms. Kristina Rose, Director, Office for Victims of Crime,here.

Title: BREAKING: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Confirms Hunter Biden Paid Prostitutes Through Law Firm, Committed Tax Fraud by Deducting Payments to Prostitutes
Date: Washington, July 19, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene questioned IRS whistleblowers on the alleged crimes of the Biden family. Congresswoman Greene's questioning confirmed Hunter Biden paid prostitutes through his law firm, OWASCO PC, and trafficked his victims across state lines in violation of the Mann Act. The IRS whistleblowers also confirmed Hunter Biden committed tax fraud by deducting payments to prostitutes from OWASCO’s taxes.

RUSHED TRANSCRIPTION:

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before we begin, I would like to let the committee and everyone watching at home that Parental discretion is advised. I would also like to remind everyone that on our oversight committee, we provide oversight into all parts of the federal government, including the Department of Justice, and their willingness to prosecute, their unwillingness to prosecute, and whether it's politically motivated. I would also like to say that when evidence and proof of a crime is presented, no prosecution should be denied, no matter who the person is, to the whistleblowers today, I thank both of you for your courage to come to the committee today. And your commitment to truth. I have great respect for it. So thank you. I would like to talk with you both about Hunter Biden, and his tax write-offs with his law firm A Wasco. I would like to ask Mr. Ziegler. When did you start your investigation and your testimony? It was November 20/18. Is that correct? Yes or no?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)

Yes, that's correct.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThank you. During your testimony with the house Ways and Means Committee, you stated that through bank records, you identified Hunter Biden was paying prostitutes related to a potential prostitution ring. Is that correct? Yes or no?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)Yes, that's correct.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneI've also reviewed that those same bank reports commonly referred to as SARS suspicious activity reports. And I'm very troubled by them, we read 1000s of them in the treasury. This particular excerpt from a SARS report talks about human trafficking. And in regards to Hunter Biden and a Wasco, and payments he was making. What's even more troubling to me is that the Department of Justice has brought no charges against Hunter Biden that will vindicate the rights of these women who are clearly victims under the law. I would like to talk about in your prior testimony, you stated that the prosecutorial team was investigating violations of the man act. Is that correct? Mr. Ziegler?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)That is correct.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneRegarding the man act, if a person is transported across state lines for sexual activity, such as process prostitution, that could be a violation of a federal law, is that correct?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)I actually recently looked at the federal law regarding man act, and I believe that that is correct. But I would refer you to the DOJ manual.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThank you. I would like to present this to the committee. This is showing Hunter Biden pain for a victim's United flight from LA to Dallas. This was a I believe this is a violation of the man act. This is Hunter Biden's This is his proof that he bought the ticket. He bought it for this woman right here. She he flew her from Los Angeles to Washington, on June 14, flew her back to Los Angeles, California on June 15, of 2018. And I would like to point out that if he was purchasing her a plane ticket for sex and traveling across state lines, do you believe that to be a violation of the man act Mr. Ziegler?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)So I can talk to specifically what's in my Tran or what's in my transcript regarding the man act. So I know we were compiling the information together.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneYes. But Mr. Ziegler travel as the law states, by the by the code of the law, it states traveling paying someone to go across state lines is is prostitution, it's a violation of the man. Let me just move on. Just one more, one more second here. So when or when Hunter Biden paid for this woman to do this with him to travel across state lines from California to Washington, DC on June 15. This is a violation of the man act. This was prostitution. Let me continue. Did Hunter Biden also use his company A Wasco PC to pay prostitutes?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)Can you hold on one second.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneMr. Chairman?

James ComerYeah, we'll give you this additional time back.

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)So regarding man acts violations, what we can do is given by the statute, we can turn those over the House Ways and Means Committee and then we can they can decide to vote to turn them over to you regarding man act.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThank you, Mr. Ziegler. are so talking about Hunter Biden using his company A Wasco PC to pay prostitutes. This is also a suspicious activity report showing that victim one, the woman that was paid for prostitution that traveled from California to Washington DC paid for by Hunter Biden. This is a an excerpt from a SARS report that we've read in the treasury. And I think you all have looked at these two, showing that victim one was supposedly an employee of a Wasco. But But I would like to point out, this is not really what most paralegals do for law firms. And it's very serious that Hunter Biden was paying this woman through his law firm, and then writing it off as business. tax exemptions. Most people write off, you know, their tax, write off things for their taxes through their businesses, like a meal, or, say, office supplies. But can you confirm for me that Hunter Biden had written off payments to prostitutes through his law firm or Wasco?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)I appreciate the question given by the statute, and limited in my testimony today, and I respectfully would need to turn those records over to the House Ways and Means Committee.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneOkay. Thank you, Mr. Ziegler. One last one last question. You referred to one of the assistants as West Coast assistant. I believe this is the West Coast assistant. Could you agree with that?

Joseph Ziegler (Whistleblower X)So I can tell you that there were deductions for what we believe to be escorts and then that $10,000 golf club membership? Yes, that was not a golf club membership. That was for a sex club payment.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThat was for a sex club payment payments, such as this through from from Hunter Biden to prostitutes, also, Mr. Shapley.

James ComerWe're one minute and 53 seconds over as long as Ms. Ocasio Cortez can get equal time. I will let the screen wrap up. Five seconds. And then I'll give Mr. Mfume additional time.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneThank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shapley, you started an investigation into Hunter Biden codenames sportsman, which opened in November of 2018. It was an offshoot of an investigation the IRS was conducting into a foreign-based amateur online pornography platform. This is evidence of Hunter Biden making sex tapes, making pornography.

James ComerThe gentlelady's time has expired.

DAILY CALLER: Largest GOP House Caucus Backs MTG’s Bill To Criminalize Child Sex-Change Operations And Puberty BlockersToday, the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest Republican caucus and a majority of the House Republican conference, endorsed Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's groundbreaking and first-in-the-nation legislation, the Protect Children's Innocence Act, announcing its inclusion in RSC's FY 2024 Budget Proposal.Congresswoman Greene's bill will make it illegal to perform any "gender-affirming" care on minors. This includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex-change surgeries. Children who are not allowed to drive, vote, or see an R-rated movie should not be allowed to make life-altering decisions that will forever alter their precious bodies.America’s children are being systematically indoctrinated with perverse gender ideology by teachers, mental health counselors, and on social media platforms. President Biden’s Assistant Secretary of Health, “Rachel” Levine, even called for the government to “empower kids to go on puberty blockers and obtain sex-reassignment surgery.”Last summer, Boston Children’s Hospital released videos promoting gender dysphoria and offering “gender-affirming care” to minors, including sterilization, castration, and mutilation.“Gender-affirming care” is the performance of any surgery for the purpose of changing the body of an individual to correspond to a sex that differs from their biological sex.What this bill does:

With today's endorsement of the Protect Children's Innocence Act, the Republican Study Committee takes a strong stand against the harmful indoctrination and mutilation of America's children.

Title: WRAP UP: Impeachment Week
Date: Washington, May 22, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Last week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced Articles of Impeachment against the President of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden, and four of his America Last executive branch appointees: Alejandro Mayorkas, Merrick Garland, Christopher Wray, and Matthew Graves.The Congresswoman's articles introduced against each official are below.

Watch the Press Conference >>

Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the United States:H. Res. 420 Cosponsors:

On Thursday, May 18, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced Articles of Impeachment against Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.Joe Biden has deliberately compromised our national security by refusing to enforce immigration laws and secure our border, allowed approximately 6 million illegals from over 160 countries to invade our country, deprived border patrol of the necessary resources and policies sufficient to protect our country, and his administration has willfully refused to maintain operational control as required by law.Biden canceled border wall construction contracts which would have secured our nation’s border, and his Department of Justice then sued Arizona when the state constructed its own border wall using shipping containers. Under his reign, there have been approximately 1.4 million known “gotaways” who have evaded U.S. authorities and more than 193 people on the terrorist watchlist have been caught while attempting to cross the border at ports of entry. He has allowed fentanyl, the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45, to overwhelmingly flood into our country and kill around 300 Americans per day. His administration has lost complete contact with approximately 85,000 unaccompanied illegal alien children and his policies have forced tens of thousands of illegal children into slave labor. He has even caused an approximate 1,700% increase in border encounters in just one sector of our Northern border.Joe Biden has reinstated catastrophic and disastrous catch and release policies, which have allowed illegals to roam our streets and terrorize Americans. He terminated one of the most successful border policies, Remain in Mexico, which not only disincentivized illegals from coming to our country, but it also protected against asylum fraud.Under Biden's command, the Secretary of Homeland Security has illegally granted mass parole to aliens when U.S. federal law only permits parole to be granted on a specific case-by-case basis.Biden endangered the lives of Americans by allowing illegal aliens who had tested positive for Covid-19 to enter the country and infect American citizens while requiring Americans be subject to testing before being permitted to return home from traveling abroad.His policies, directives, and statements surrounding the Southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country. Biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty, and he is a direct threat to our national security. Therefore, Joseph Robinette Biden is unfit to serve as President of the United States and must be impeached.

Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security:H. Res. 411 Cosponsors:

On Wednesday, May 17, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced Articles of Impeachment against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.Since assuming office, Secretary Mayorkas has aided and abetted the complete invasion of our country by deliberately flooding our nation with drugs, terrorists, and illegal aliens.He stated under oath that we have operational control of our borders, while also under oath, he stated that no one has ever achieved operational control of the border. He lied to the American people, he lied under oath, and he has blatantly violated his oath of office.Under Mayorkas's watch, he has allowed approximately 6 million illegal border encounters, a record amount of fentanyl seized at the border, totaling approximately 40,000 pounds, more than 193 people on terrorist watchlists caught while attempting to cross the border at ports of entry, approximately 1.4 million known “gotaways” who have evaded U.S. authorities, approximately 1,424 deaths of illegals at the Southern border (853 dead illegals – the most ever in a 12-month period—died trying to cross the Southern border in 2022), and an approximate 870% increase in border encounters in just one sector of the Northern border.During his reign, the annual number of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) referred to HHS custody after crossing illegally has more than tripled over the past two years. There have been more than 348,812 unaccompanied illegal children encountered at the Southern border, with at least 85,000 of these children being missing, and his policies have forced tens of thousands of illegal children into slave labor.Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly pulled over 50% of border agents from guarding the border wall and moved them to processing, caring for, and transferring illegals, leaving huge gaps for cartels and smugglers to exploit.The Secretary provided copious amounts of baby formula to illegal aliens at one of the largest processing centers in the country, all while American mothers and infants were intensely suffering from severe shortages. He flooded a hospital’s maternity unit with illegal aliens, so much so, that American mothers were forced to delay inductions.Mayorkas canceled border wall construction contracts which would have secured our nation’s border, violated the law by directing DHS to "mass-parole" illegal aliens into the U.S. when federal law specifically prohibits this, encouraged asylum fraud, abused the credible fear standard, and exercised mass catch and release policies.Not only has Secretary Mayorkas enabled child exploitation, sex and drug trafficking, and fentanyl overdoses, but he has also done everything in his power to put Americans last. His policies, directives, and statements have created a national security crisis and have endangered the lives of American citizens.As a result of intentionally failing to secure our homeland and putting the lives of every American in danger from his very first day in office, Alejandro Mayorkas is unfit to hold the office of Secretary of Homeland Security and must be impeached.

Merrick Garland, U.S. Attorney General:

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also introduced Articles of Impeachment on May 17th against Attorney General Merrick Garland.Since Merrick Garland took over as Attorney General in March of 2021, he has completely weaponized the Department of ‘Injustice.’ The politicization of the DOJ has resulted in the persecution of the left’s political enemies, and a two-tiered justice system.Garland has used the FBI as a personal police force for his boss, Joe Biden. From investigating parents who protest their local school boards, to going after pro-life activists and Catholics, to persecuting former and future President Donald J. Trump, Merrick Garland’s corruption knows no bounds.Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists have caused billions of dollars of damage to property. Instead of prosecuting these crimes, Garland has persecuted Americans who engaged in legitimate political protest, people who were overwhelmingly nonviolent.The DOJ’s persecution of Joe Biden’s primary political adversary, Donald J. Trump, is anti-American. Raiding the former President’s home for legally declassifying documents is a transparent violation of justice. Persecuting a declared candidate for President of the United States is nothing short of election interference.Therefore, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland must be impeached.

Christopher Wray, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation:

H. Res. 406 Cosponsors:

On Tuesday, May 16, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced Articles of Impeachment against FBI Director Christopher Wray.Under Wray’s watch, the FBI has intimidated, harassed, and entrapped American citizens that have been deemed enemies of the Biden regime. As such, Director Wray has turned the FBI into Joe Biden and Merrick Garland's personal police force.The Soviet-style tactics used by the FBI against normal Americans are unprecedented in this country. FBI whistleblower Garret O’Boyle told congressional investigators that the FBI created a terrorist threat tag following the Dobbs Supreme Court decision in 2022. O’Boyle confirmed that the purpose of the tag was to target pro-life individuals. On September 23, 2022, armed FBI agents in tactical gear raided the family home of Mark Houck, a pro-life Catholic and father of 7 young children, because he obstructed access to an abortion clinic.FBI whistleblower Kyle Seraphin obtained a leaked FBI document that targets Traditional Latin Mass Catholics. The document, titled “Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVE) and their interests in ‘Radical-Traditionalist Catholics’ or RTCs,” was reported out of the Richmond Field Office and dated for January 23, 2023. This leaked document outlined a plan for the FBI to spy on Catholics, particularly Latin Mass-attending Catholics, who, according to the document, have harbored “white supremacy.” The FBI document indicated intentions to have informants within the Catholic Church, on advice from the Southern Poverty Law Center.In October 2020, a group of men allegedly attempted to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Several of the men were acquitted in their cases, as the FBI was found to have entrapped them in the scheme. Most of the members involved with the plot were FBI informants.On August 8, 2022, the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, the home of former President Donald J. Trump, in search of classified documents. The documents in question were removed from the White House by the General Services Administration during the presidential transition and stored in a secure room at President Trump's residence as agreed upon with the FBI and the National Archives and Records Administration. Regardless of the classification of the documents, President Trump broke no laws as he was fully entitled to declassify any documents of his choosing under the Presidential Records Act.Joe Biden, however, was storing documents in his garage and in remote facilities from his time as a United States Senator and as Vice President. No law entitled Joe Biden to be in personal possession of classified documents at any time. And one has to wonder, how was Joe Biden even able to remove such highly sensitive documents from a SCIF in the first place? Joe Biden broke the law, but he was never treated like a criminal and national security threat like innocent President Trump was. It's two-tiered justice.Not only has Director Wray persecuted political opponents in an unprecedented and partisan way, but he has also overseen his agency take actions to shield and protect the current President and his family. A senior FBI official left the agency under a cloud of accusations that he shielded a laptop belonging to the President’s son, Robert Hunter Biden, from a criminal probe.It is unacceptable for the Director of the FBI or any civil officer to exercise his power in a way that targets one political class while doing favors for the other.Therefore, by the powers vested in Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene as a duly elected Member of the House of Representatives, she is officially introducing Articles of Impeachment against the corrupt FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Matthew Graves, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia:

H. Res. 405 Cosponsors:

On May 16, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also introduced Articles of Impeachment against U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves.Matthew Graves was appointed to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia on July 26, 2021 and he assumed office on November 5, 2021.During his time in office, U.S. Attorney Graves has totally subverted the justice system of the United States and facilitated the explosion of violent crime in Washington D.C. by refusing to prosecute violent crimes.In fact, Graves has refused to prosecute 67% of arrests in the District of Columbia during his tenure. In response, D.C. Police Chief Robert Congee has said "We need to keep violent people in jail. When people talk about what we're gonna do different, or what we should do different, what we need to do different, that's the thing that we need to do different."Graves has prosecuted hundreds of individuals who participated in a political protest and has sought lengthy pretrial detention, even for nonviolent defendants. His cruel and unusual tactics have driven innocent people, arrested on phony charges, to suicide, including Matthew Perna.Graves is systematically criminalizing political dissent at the behest of his handlers in the White House. By focusing so much effort on the persecution of political prisoners, Graves has diminished the manpower needed to fight crime not just in DC, but all over the country. DOJ attorneys have been transferred to DC just to help Graves wage his war against political opponents.His wife, Fatima Goss Graves, is the CEO of the National Women’s Legal Center. She is using her 100-million-dollar business to run a pressure campaign against Justice Clarence Thomas. Matthew Graves and his wife are clearly partisan hacks with no respect for the justice system or the rule of law.With a total dereliction of duty as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves must be impeached.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the United States
Date: Washington, May 18, 2023

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced Articles of Impeachment against Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.Joe Biden has deliberately compromised our national security by refusing to enforce immigration laws and secure our border, allowed approximately 6 million illegals from over 160 countries to invade our country, deprived border patrol of the necessary resources and policies sufficient to protect our country, and his administration has willfully refused to maintain operational control as required by law.Biden canceled border wall construction contracts which would have secured our nation’s border, and his Department of Justice then sued Arizona when the state constructed its own border wall using shipping containers. Under his reign, there have been approximately 1.4 million known “gotaways” who have evaded U.S. authorities and more than 193 people on the terrorist watchlist have been caught while attempting to cross the border at ports of entry. He has allowed fentanyl, the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45, to overwhelmingly flood into our country and kill around 300 Americans per day. His administration has lost complete contact with approximately 85,000 unaccompanied illegal alien children and his policies have forced tens of thousands of illegal children into slave labor. He has even caused an approximate 1,700% increase in border encounters in just one sector of our Northern border.Joe Biden has reinstated catastrophic and disastrous catch and release policies, which have allowed illegals to roam our streets and terrorize Americans. He terminated one of the most successful border policies, Remain in Mexico, which not only disincentivized illegals from coming to our country, but it also protected against asylum fraud.Under Biden's command, the Secretary of Homeland Security has illegally granted mass parole to aliens when U.S. federal law only permits parole to be granted on a specific case-by-case basis.Biden endangered the lives of Americans by allowing illegal aliens who had tested positive for Covid-19 to enter the country and infect American citizens while requiring Americans be subject to testing before being permitted to return home from traveling abroad.His policies, directives, and statements surrounding the Southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country. Biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty, and he is a direct threat to our national security. Therefore, Joseph Robinette Biden is unfit to serve as President of the United States and must be impeached.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
Date: Washington, May 17, 2023

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is introducing Articles of Impeachment against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.Since assuming office, Secretary Mayorkas has aided and abetted the complete invasion of our country by deliberately flooding our nation with drugs, terrorists, and illegal aliens.He stated under oath that we have operational control of our borders, while also under oath, he stated that no one has ever achieved operational control of the border. He lied to the American people, he lied under oath, and he has blatantly violated his oath of office.Under Mayorkas's watch, he has allowed approximately 6 million illegal border encounters, a record amount of fentanyl seized at the border, totaling approximately 40,000 pounds, more than 193 people on terrorist watchlists caught while attempting to cross the border at ports of entry, approximately 1.4 million known “gotaways” who have evaded U.S. authorities, approximately 1,424 deaths of illegals at the Southern border (853 dead illegals – the most ever in a 12-month period—died trying to cross the Southern border in 2022), and an approximate 870% increase in border encounters in just one sector of the Northern border.During his reign, the annual number of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) referred to HHS custody after crossing illegally has more than tripled over the past two years. There have been more than 348,812 unaccompanied illegal children encountered at the Southern border, with at least 85,000 of these children being missing, and his policies have forced tens of thousands of illegal children into slave labor.Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly pulled over 50% of border agents from guarding the border wall and moved them to processing, caring for, and transferring illegals, leaving huge gaps for cartels and smugglers to exploit.The Secretary provided copious amounts of baby formula to illegal aliens at one of the largest processing centers in the country, all while American mothers and infants were intensely suffering from severe shortages. He flooded a hospital’s maternity unit with illegal aliens, so much so, that American mothers were forced to delay inductions.Mayorkas canceled border wall construction contracts which would have secured our nation’s border, violated the law by directing DHS to "mass-parole" illegal aliens into the U.S. when federal law specifically prohibits this, encouraged asylum fraud, abused the credible fear standard, and exercised mass catch and release policies.Not only has Secretary Mayorkas enabled child exploitation, sex and drug trafficking, and fentanyl overdoses, but he has also done everything in his power to put Americans last. His policies, directives, and statements have created a national security crisis and have endangered the lives of American citizens.As a result of intentionally failing to secure our homeland and putting the lives of every American in danger from his very first day in office, Alejandro Mayorkas is unfit to hold the office of Secretary of Homeland Security and must be impeached.

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin following the release of classified documents from alleged whistleblower Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, a 21-year- old member of the 102nd Intelligence Wing of Massachusetts.Mr. Teixeria has exposed the corruption of the Biden Administration, the most unforgivable of crimes against the regime. We now know that Joe Biden lied to the American people from day one about the war in Ukraine, as the United States is actively engaged in a proxy war with Russia with American special forces on the ground in Ukraine and totally jeopardized peace efforts by pushing our country to the brink of nuclear holocaust.In response to the information contained in the documents released by Mr. Teixeria, Congresswoman Greene is seeking answers to the following questions from Secretary of Defense Austin:

Congresswoman Greene expects an expeditious response to her letter concerning transparency and accountability in the Department of Defense.

April 14, 2023

Hon. Lloyd J. AustinSecretary of DefenseU.S. Department of Defense1000 Defense, PentagonWashington, D.C. 20301-1000Dear Secretary Austin:Nearly 100 special forces from Western countries, including more than a dozen Americans, have been operating on the ground in Ukraine, according to leaked classified documents. These classified documents were allegedly leaked by Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, a 21-year- old member of the 102nd Intelligence Wing of Massachusetts.It is apparent that Mr. Teixeira is a whistleblower exposing the corruption of the Biden Administration. From day one, Joe Biden has lied to the American people about the war in Ukraine. His decision to send billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and aid to Ukraine has engaged the United States in a proxy war it cannot afford, jeopardized peace efforts, and pushed the United States to the brink of nuclear holocaust. A U.S. Troop presence in Ukraine was never authorized by Congress and demonstrates that Joe Biden is open to pursuing a broader conflict between two nuclear powers.It is vital for the Department of Defense to provide Congress with answers on the presence of U.S. troops in Ukraine. Therefore, I, as a duly elected Member of Congress, demand direct answers to the following questions:

I look forward to your expeditious response to this letter concerning transparency and accountability in the Department of Defense.Sincerely,Marjorie Taylor GreeneMember of Congress

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Sends Letter to U.S. Attorney General and FBI Director Following Open Threat Against Pro-Life Activists and Politicians By Jane Fonda on The View

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray inquiring about their respective agency's handling of the threat Jane Fonda made onThe Viewon March 10, 2023, when she adamantly called for the murder of all pro-life activists and politicians.EXCLUSIVE: MTG Calls For FBI, DOJ To Investigate Threats Against Pro-Lifers After Jane Fonda’s ‘Murder’ Comment - Daily Caller

Hon. Merrick B. GarlandAttorney General of the United StatesU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20530-0001

Hon. Christopher A. WrayDirector, Federal Bureau of Investigation935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20530-0001

Dear Attorney General Garland and Director Wray:

On March 10, 2023, Hollywood actress and pro-abortion activist Jane Fonda appeared on ABC’sThe Viewand suggested that American women should “murder” pro-life activists and politicians to ensure the right to kill an unborn child. Fonda made the comment when the hosts asked her what people could do other than simply march or protest. “Well, I have thought of murder,” Fonda said. When asked to repeat herself Fonda restated adamantly, “murder.”

These comments are extremely inappropriate and alarming. Calling for the murder of elected officials and innocent pro-life activists over a political disagreement is abhorrent and extremely dangerous. Since last year, there have been nearly 100 recorded acts of violence and intimidation against pro-life individuals and organizations. Fonda’s comments will embolden pro-abortion groups and individuals to attack and potentially murder pro-life lawmakers, leaders, and activists. Jane Fonda’s statements andThe View’s role in airing them cannot be ignored and I demand full accountability from all law enforcement agencies, especially the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

It is vital that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI take action to protect pro-life Americans from violence that directly results from Jane Fonda’s horrific statements. Therefore, I, as a duly elected Member of Congress, demand direct answers to the following questions: 
(1) Are the DOJ and/or the FBI currently investigating attacks on pro-life individuals and organizations? 
(2) How many threats against pro-life individuals and organizations have been referred to the DOJ and FBI since Jane Fonda’s comments on March 10, 2023? 
(3) What actions have the DOJ and FBI taken to address threats against pro-life lawmakers, leaders, organizations, and activists since Jane Fonda’s comments on March 10, 2023? 
(4) Do Jane Fonda’s comments meet a criminal threshold? If so, will the DOJ and FBI investigate?

We look forward to your expeditious response within 15 days of receipt of this letter concerning the protection of American citizens and elected officials.

Sincerely,

Title: BREAKING: Oversight Committee Sends Letter to DC Mayor Demanding Accountability in the DC Jail and Its Treatment of Pre-Trial Detainees
Date: Washington, March 9, 2023
Tags: Congress

Content:
Tonight, Chairman Jamie Comer, Congressman Clay Higgins, and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene sent a letter on behalf of the Oversight Committee to DC Mayor Muriel Bowser demanding accountability in the DC Jail and its treatment of pre-trial detainees.

March 9, 2023

The Honorable Muriel BowserMayor of the District of Columbia1350 Pennsylvania Ave. NW #406Washington, D.C. 20004

Dear Mayor Bowser:

The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DC DOC), the District of Columbia Central Detention Facility, and the District of Columbia Central Treatment Facility (the latter two, collectively, DC Jail Facilities). The DC Jail Facilities’ reported mistreatment of pre-trial detainees connected to the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, raise the Committee’s and Members’ concerns that DC DOC is violating detainees’ constitutional and human rights. Eyewitness accounts of conditions at the DC Jail Facilities—particularly regarding the treatment of January 6 detainees—paint a picture of despair, hopelessness, and a severe abuse of justice. No prisoner in the United States should be treated in this fashion. Therefore, the Committee requests certain documents and information regarding DC DOC and the DC Jail Facilities and requests you direct DC DOC to arrange for a congressional delegation to visit and review the DC Jail Facilities and conduct interviews with detainees and DC DOC employees.

The Committee is investigating reports that detainees have been subjected to inhumane treatment while incarcerated at the DC Jail Facilities. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of the Committee visited the DC Jail Facilities in November 2021, despite repeated attempts by DC DOC to not allow that visit. Rep. Greene detailed her findings in a report released December 2021. During Rep. Greene’s tour of the DC Jail Facilities, detainees showed her evidence of abuse and neglect they had suffered under DC DOC employees’ watch. One inmate reported being beaten by other detainees and not being provided care. One detainee has written that he had had to use the same contact lenses for at least six months. Another showed evidence of having a fractured bone that was left untreated. Another reported being served food with chemicals or other substances in it. Reports of detainees not being provided haircuts and being forced to live with clogged toilets have been confirmed by Rep. Greene’s eyewitness account. One detainee with severe and documented food allergies described how he had not been provided alternative food options to accommodate his condition and faced the choice between not eating or place himself in severe pain from the food provided by the DC Jail Facilities.

The Committee also plans to confirm the accuracy of reports of disparate treatment January 6 detainees have received while incarcerated in the DC Jail Facilities. During Rep. Greene’s visit to the DC Jail Facilities, non-January 6 detainees were permitted a lifestyle in the DC Jail Facilities very different from those incarcerated for January 6-related matters. Rep. Greene witnessed non-January 6 detainees receiving instruction from law school students about how to handle their pending matters in court. The January 6 detainees did not receive access to that seminar but, instead, told Rep. Greene they had been denied access to counsel or given the choice of either taking a shower, speaking with their families, or speaking with counsel. If the allegations made to Rep. Greene are true, these represent serious abuses by DC DOC of these detainees’ constitutional rights.

The Committee is concerned by reports that January 6 detainees are facing a unique form of mistreatment due to their politics and beliefs, representing potential several human rights abuses. During her visit, Rep. Greene listened as January 6 detainees said they had been denied access to a Bible or denied access to Communion based on their vaccination status. Additionally, Rep. Greene witnessed non-January 6 detainees participating in the Justice Policy Institute’s DC’s Young Men Emerging Unit, in which, “[u]nlike a traditional correctional unit, the walls are bright, vibrant, and decorated” and “the residents [have] retrofitted cells into workforce development opportunities, including a barber shop.” Rep. Greene did not see any January 6-detainee being allowed to participate in this program, and its facilities stand in stark contrast to the rest of the DC Jail Facilities, where, as reported by the Washington Post, prisoners have been locked down for 23-hours per day and “many of the men [] ha[ve] grown long hair, beards and fingernails.” For detainees not in programs such as the “Young Men Emerging Unit,”

water “had been shut off for days” as punishment, creating an “overpowering” stench from “standing human sewage” in the toilets of many cells[]. “Hot meals” were “served cold and congealed”; some inmates had “observable injuries” for which no documentation was available; and “evidence of drug use was pervasive,” including the “widespread” odor of marijuana.

The Committee is not alone in its concern about an unfair treatment of detainees. On October 13, 2021, a U.S. District Court found that DC DOC Director Quincy Booth and Warden Wanda Patten violated a detainee’s civil rights. The Judge in that case wrote:

I find that the civil rights of the defendant have been abused. I don’t know if it’s because he’s a January 6th defendant or not, but I find this matter should be referred to the attorney general of the United States for a civil rights investigation into whether the D.C. Department of Corrections is violating the civil rights of January 6th defendants...in this and maybe other cases.

As a result, the matter was referred to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for a civil rights investigation. Days after the referral, the U.S. Marshals Service conducted an unannounced inspection and review of DC Jail Facilities. From October 18 to October 23, 2021, an eight-person team inspected the facility and interviewed more than 300 detainees. The team found “egregious” conditions at the DC Jail Facilities. However, on October 24, 2021, DC DOC employees ordered the marshals to leave the DC Jail Facilities. One marshal said he “ha[d] never seen a jail bar marshals from entering.” The Acting U.S. Marshal summarized the preliminary review as finding “evidence of ‘systemic’ mistreatment of detainees” and forwarded the results to the DOJ Civil Rights Division. In response, DOJ announced they would transfer 400 detainees from the DC Jail Facilities. However, to the Committee’s knowledge, none of the January 6-detainees were part of the group removed from the DC Jail Facilities.

On April 19, 2021, Committee Republicans wrote you a letter identifying various violations of detainees’ civil rights at the DC Jail Facilities, including reports of detainees’ inability to obtain essential services, denial of sanitary living conditions, and subjection to prolonged time in solitary confinement. Committee Republicans did not receive a response, though a federal court later confirmed Committee Republicans’ concerns. Since the 2021 letter, the District—and its handling of crime and those accused of committing crimes—has reached new lows. Under your mayorship, District homicides are up 40 percent over last year,  which itself set recent records for crime. In the face of this disaster, the D.C. Council has responded by passing dangerous legislation so liberal and soft on crime that even President Biden has agreed with Republicans that Congress must intervene.

To assist the Committee in its investigation into DC DOC’s treatment of detainees, please provide the following documents and information to the Committee no later than March 23, 2023:

All documents and communications regarding January 6 detainees’ waiver of speedy trial;

All documents and communications regarding January 6 detainees’ complaints regarding their cell conditions, sanitary conditions, access to food, access to legal counsel, access to materials relevant to their legal defense, and access to religious material and/or rites;

All documents and communications regarding the DC Jail Facilities’ COVID-19 policies since January 7, 2021; and

All documents and communications regarding the U.S. Marshals Service’s inspection in October 2021, including but not limited to the November 2021 agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service.

Additionally, we request that you make arrangements with the Committee to allow full access to the DC Jail Facilities (including the ability to speak with detainees) to Members of Congress and staff no later than March 23, 2023.

To make arrangements to deliver documents or to ask any related follow-up questions, please contact Committee on Oversight and Accountability staff at (202) 225-5074. An attachment to this letter provides additional instructions for responding to the Committee's request.

The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is the principal oversight committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and has broad authority to investigate “any matter” at “any time” under House Rule X. Additionally, House Rule X states that the Committee on Oversight and Accountability has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, which is subject to congressional oversight under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important investigation.

Title: BREAKING: Former CDC Director Robert Redfield Reveals the COVID-19 Virus Was Likely Created by Gain of Function Research Funded by Dr. Fauci and the NIAID
Date: Washington, March 8, 2023
Tags: Health

Content:
RUSHED TRANSCRIPTION:

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneIf we're going to look into the origins of COVID, and fully understand where this virus came from this virus that has murdered so many people all over the world, I think the most important thing we can do today is look at the timeline.And if we go back to early 2020, when this was just starting to kill so many people will see something interesting that while Dr. Fauci Dr. Anderson, Dr. Collins, Peter Danzig from eco health, who by the way, had a grant for gain of function research, Dr. Aachen, Closs, and others were doing everything possible to shut down the Wuhan lab theory publicly, even though privately, they told each other, that COVID-19 looked engineered and discuss the reason to stop the theory. And if they were to, it's really interesting.

They wanted to give reasons for not expressing this opinion to the public word that it would do great potential harm to science and international harmony, and do unnecessary harm to science in general, and science and China, in particular, even though their paychecks are funded by the American taxpayers. At the same time, this was going on.

The CCP was using its full weight and power to spread a propaganda campaign to conceal the origins of COVID members of numbers of cases and deaths and protect their own reputations while stockpiling medical supplies, severely hurting the global supply chain and definitely hurting America.

In the same way, the CCP silence centered and prison dissenters who tried to tell the truth. Dr. Fauci and his cohorts seemingly were running their own misinformation, and ultimately censorship campaign, to in quotes from Dr. Collins to Dr. Fauci put down this very destructive conspiracy about the lab leak theory, but it's really interesting, I think we should revisit January 27 and 2020 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, finds out that they have a financial relationship with the Wuhan Institute of virology through eco Health Alliance, and that they have been working with novel coronaviruses January 31 2020, Dr. Fauci has warned by Dr. Christian Andersen that some of COVID nineteen's features potentially look engineered.

And the genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory. Dr. Redfield, did you agree in your opinion with Dr. Anderson's assessment at the time that this virus did look engineered?

Former CDC Director Robert RedfieldI was concerned because of the presence of the fearing cleavage site that we've talked about.

And I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does, that cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID.

So now, which could not see the h2 receptor, which is the human receptor, it shows totally changes the orientation now.

So it has high affinity for human receptor so that Furin cleavage site bothered me it didn't seem that it belong there.

And then when you look at the sequences that it used, and it's beyond the committee, but I know many of you have looked into it, the sequences that they used in those 12 nucleotides for arginine were the arginine sequences nucleotide triplet that coded for the human arginine.

So why did this virus have the arginine sequences for human? They're not bad was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneWas this, what you're observing and speaking of is this something that would be in line with gain of function research and the capabilities that would provide to virus?

Former CDC Director Robert RedfieldYeah, I mean, basically, this lab published in 2014, that they accomplished in this allowing the Coronavirus is that they were working with in the lab to bind to the h2 receptor and humanized mice, and the only way they did that was by reorienting the binding domain.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneAnd it was clear to them at this time, that was likely the issue in their private conversations.

Yet by February 4, a paper on the origins of COVID is drafted by four participants of the February one conference call.

One of those participants, Dr. Anderson completely reverses himself in an email to the president of eco health, Peter Danzig, and says the main crop crackpot theories going around at the moment relate to this virus being somehow engineered and that is is demonstrably false.

My question to you Mr. Redfield, did you know of any evidence that they had found within three days from February 1 to February 4, to be able to confirm that it was not created in a lab?

Former CDC Director Robert RedfieldAs I mentioned earlier, unfortunately, I was excluded from those conversations, which I found retroactively very disappointed, since I was obviously a virologist, and very engaged and I actually had asked Jeremy Farrar, Tony Fauci and Tedros to have these conversations.

And then to be excluded, I found unusual.

I do think it illustrates one point it's worth really focusing on.

When when you have a group of people that decide there can only be one point of view that's problematic.

And I'll keep going saying it's antithetical to science. And unfortunately, that's what they did.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneI can tell you Dr. Redfield, that is the case it's very problematic because how people suffered in this country from those what I would call tirade, nickel decisions, using their positions of power and shutting down the countries the way they did.

I think people definitely feel that way.

Thank you.

I yield back.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Reintroduces Resolution to Declare Antifa a Domestic Terrorist Organization
Date: Washington, March 7, 2023
Tags: Sponsored & Cosponsored Legislation

Content:
Over the past several years, Antifa-affiliated groups and individuals have been burning down cities across the country, destroying property, assaulting police officers, beating innocent people, and causing billions of dollars in damages.

Most recently, Antifa-affiliated rioters committed acts of domestic terrorism by torching the future Atlanta police training facility with fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and launching other destructive items such as rocks and bricks at police officers.

Antifa has repeatedly committed acts of terrorism against law enforcement, businesses, government property, and innocent Americans and needs to be brought to justice.

The Department of Justice must deem the unlawful conduct of Antifa as domestic terrorism, as defined in section 2331 of Title 18, United States Code, and prosecute these acts accordingly

This bill would designate certain unlawful conduct of Antifa members as acts of domestic terrorism; designate Antifa, and any other affiliated group or subsidiary of Antifa, as a domestic terrorist organization; and call on the Department of Justice to prosecute crimes of domestic terrorism committed by Antifa.

Upon introduction, Congresswoman Greene's bill has seven original cosponsors: Rep. Gosar (AZ), Rep. Hunt (TX), Rep. Miller (IL), Rep. McCormick (GA), Rep. Higgins (LA), Rep. Biggs (AZ), and Rep. Santos (NY).

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Reintroduces Resolution of Inquiry Demanding an Audit of Taxpayer Dollars Sent to Ukraine

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a privileged Resolution of Inquiry into Taxpayer Dollars Spent in Ukraine to find out exactly where OUR money is going.

While the warmongers and the Biden Administration have sent over $113 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, our border patrol asked for just $15.46 billion to secure our southern border and stop the flow of Chinese-made, Mexican Cartel imported fentanyl and human trafficking into the United States.

President Trump's border wall would have cost only $22 billion to stop the more than 6 million aliens that have invaded our country illegally since Biden took office. The 82,000 Russians invading Ukraine pales in comparison.

Congresswoman Greene's resolution requests that President Biden, along with Defense Secretary Austin and Secretary of State Blinken, provide the House with all relevant information about how taxpayer dollars are being used in Ukraine.

Congresswoman Greene proudly introduced this same resolution in the 117th Congress with unanimous support among House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans.

Upon introduction, Congresswoman Greene's Resolution of Inquiry has eight original cosponsors: Massie (KY), Rosendale (MT), Higgins (LA), Gaetz (FL), Roy (TX), Burchett (TN), Miller (IL), and Gosar (AZ).

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene RIPS Former Twitter Executives at House Oversight and Accountability Hearing

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene delivered the following remarks at the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing entitled, "Part 1: Twitter’s Role in Suppressing the Biden Laptop Story."

Transcript:Mr. Baker, Miss Gadde, Mr. Roth, and Miss Navaroli, you can consider your speech canceled during my time because you canceled mine.

You see, you permanently banned my personal Twitter account.

And it was my campaign account also.

So let's talk about election interference, shall we?

January 2, 2022, you permanently banned my Twitter account.

This was the account that I would put my campaign ads on, raise money on, fight back when attacked with lies, and be able to talk to my voters in my district, but you banned it.

And then let me explain.

My Account was not reinstated until November 21, 2022.

That was after my election on November 8.

You know, at your company, or your former company where you worked, Twitter employees, over 98% of them, donate to Democrats.

So while you coordinated with DHS, the FBI, the CIA, our government, and outside groups to permanently shadow-ban conservative Americans, and candidates like me, and the former President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump, you were censoring and wrongfully violating our First Amendment free speech rights.

Guess what, none of you hold security clearances, none of you are elected, and none of you represent 750,000 people like I do.

Let's explain.

52 United States law 10101.

No person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or attempt to stop any other person for the purpose of interfering with their rights to vote or to vote as he may choose.

You didn't shadow-ban or permanently ban my Democrat opponent.

No, you did that to me.

And that was wrong, and it was against the law.

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene delivered the following remarks at the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability's Organizational Meeting for the 118th Congress.

America's Two-Tier Justice System

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneMiss Crockett, I do agree with you about Tyree Nichols death.I watched the video and it was tragic and and extremely difficult to watch.I would also like to point out that that city is Democrat controlled, and the five officers that have been arrested and charged are black.And I think that this isn't isn't an issue of racism or anything like that.I think that the judge and the jury in the trial needs to work out what happened there, but I share that with you.But I'd like to also point something that I'd hope you share with me.There's a woman in this room whose daughter was murdered on January 6, Ashli Babbitt. And there's never been a trial.As a matter of fact, no one has cared about the person that shot and killed her. And no one in this Congress has really addressed that issue.January 6 committee didn't address it.And I believe that there are many people that came into the Capitol on January 6, whose civil rights and liberties are being violated heavily.And this committee will, I hope, Mr. Chairman, look into those civil rights abuses, because they're happening in a jail right here in this city.And I hope Miss Norton will will care about that as well, as well as jails across the country.I've been in that jail.And it's not just the January 6 defendants, pretrial, by the way, it's many of the inmates in there living in horrific conditions.So I think that's something that you and I can care about.

Congressman Jamie RaskinWill the gentlelady yield just for a moment?Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneNo, I will not yield.But I would like to say and point out this: civil rights and liberties are important, but we have to make sure that we crack down on the two-tier justice system, because that needs to end.

Subpoena Power

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneI really appreciate the sentiments of bipartisanship.

Getting to Work for the American People

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor GreeneI oppose this amendment.I think it's important for us to all recognize that the White House just announced that they'll be calling an end to the COVID-19 emergency.So there's no need for us to vote to amend the rules to allow for this.Of course, we extend our heartfelt prayers and good well wishes to Mr. Raskin as he's going through cancer treatment, something certainly all of us can understand and hope the best for him.As far as pregnancy, pregnancy is a wonderful gift for women and becoming a mother is a wonderful thing.It doesn't stop many women from showing up for work.So I don't think that should be considered to be a concern of why we need to adopt this amendment that members can't show up.I think it's important for all members to come and be present as much as they possibly can because we have a job to do for the American people.

Title: Congresswoman MTG Honors Judge Harold L. Murphy and Introduces Legislation to Commemorate His Legacy

Tags: Sponsored & Cosponsored Legislation

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene honors the life of Judge Harold L. Murphy. In addition to introducing legislation to commemorate Judge Murphy's legacy by naming a federal courthouse in his honor, Congresswoman MTG delivered the following remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives:"I rise today to honor a man who devoted his life to the service and protection of our nation, Judge Harold Murphy.Born in Felton, Georgia, in 1927, Judge Murphy attended West Georgia College before serving in the Navy toward the end of World War II. He resumed his studies at the University of Mississippi and the University of Georgia School of Law, where he graduated in 1949. He began a law practice in Haralson County, Georgia, and in 1950 was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as the youngest Member at the time.Judge Murphy served five consecutive terms before stepping down in 1961 to focus on practicing law. In 1971, Judge Murphy was appointed by Governor Jimmy Carter to the Superior Court for the Tallapoosa Judicial Circuit, and following his election in 1976, President Carter nominated Judge Murphy to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 28, 1977.For 45 years, he served his country on the Federal bench and became an acclaimed jurist and legal icon with a stellar reputation that extended far beyond Georgia. He always displayed a quick wit and a keen sense of humor, was kind and empathetic, and treated all those who appeared before him with courtesy and respect.Judge Murphy once subpoenaed a talking myna bird who had “witnessed” a store robbery to testify in court.Judge Murphy’s humor was only surpassed by his fairness and prudential impartiality. In fact, he is the only judge that was known to receive Christmas cards from inmates in prison that Judge Murphy himself put away! He was so excruciatingly fair and impartial, that, during one case, he even talked a defendant out of a guilty plea.Judge Murphy worked tirelessly and carried a full docket until the age of 90, when he took senior judge status in the Northern District of Georgia. He continued to preside over cases until his death on December 28, 2022.Judge Murphy received many professional awards and recognitions, including from the State Bar of Georgia and the University of Georgia School of Law.In 2014, Alabama State University renamed its graduate school after Judge Murphy in recognition of his landmark ruling in Knight v. Alabama, a long-running case that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals asked him to handle involving the vestiges of racial segregation then present in the Alabama University System.Above all else, Judge Murphy was a loving and devoted husband and father—and a strong role model who made everyone who knew him in northwest Georgia proud.The daily sight of Judge Murphy leading his gaggle of clerks to lunch on Broad Street will be deeply missed by the community in Rome that he loved so much, and that loved him back.The people of the 14th District of Georgia therefore urge the House to pass this bill, to name the building at 600 East First Street in Rome, Georgia, the “Harold L. Murphy Federal Building and United States Courthouse”.Thank you."Watch Congresswoman MTG's remarkshere.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statements after today’s Steering Committee votes assigning her to the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the House Committee on Homeland Security for the 118th Congress.

Oversight and Accountability

"One of the key agenda items for the Republican majority in the 118th Congress is oversight. That’s why I’m honored to be selected to serve on what could arguably be the most important committee this Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.

We will return the role of the Oversight Committee to investigating waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement of the federal government, which is exactly what the American people are fed up with.

Joe Biden, be prepared. We are going to uncover every corrupt business dealing, every foreign entanglement, every abuse of power, and every check cut for The Big Guy.

And it’s not just the Biden Crime Family, the GOP majority will investigate every bit of government being used to abuse the American people. Every three and four letter agency will now have to answer to Republican oversight, not the rubber-stamp of Democrat rule.I can’t wait to get started and look forward to my assignment being ratified next week by the entire GOP conference."

Homeland Security

"It will be my honor to serve my constituents and the American People on the House Committee on Homeland Security to focus on the security of the United States.

Our Southern border is being invaded by millions of illegal aliens, criminals, and potential terrorists. Our People are being murdered by Chinese fentanyl flooding in from the cartels. Our Border Patrol and ICE agents have their hands tied and have been turned into a welcoming committee by the Biden administration. Cyber attacks continue on our nation's people and businesses along with many more threats to our homeland.It’s time for accountability with Republicans in charge.

We will investigate the Biden administration’s violations of our laws and fund (and defund) programs to defend our border and American sovereignty.I can’t wait to get started and look forward to my assignment being ratified next week by the entire GOP conference."

Title: Rep. MTG Demands the FBI Be Held Accountable for Unconstitutionally Stripping Americans of Their Second-Amendment Rights
Date: Washington, October 26, 2022
Tags: Second Amendment

Content:
This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene mailed letters to United States Attorney General Merrick Garland and Christopher Wray, Director of the FBI. The letters demand that the FBI be held accountable for intimidating American citizens into signing away their right to own, purchase, and use firearms.

It has been uncovered that FBI personnel created a form that was secretly used to coerce Americans into “voluntarily” giving up their right to own, purchase, or use firearms. At least 15 Americans signed the form from 2016-2019, and their information was entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). These Americans had committed no crimes, but they were intimidated into signing the unconstitutional form when FBI agents ambushed them at their homes and other locations.

Gun Owners of America (GOA) notified the Attorney General that the FBI had infringed upon the Second Amendment rights of those coerced into signing the secret form. The Attorney General had 30 days to ensure that appropriate changes were made to NICS, and he failed to do so.

Congresswoman Greene’s letter demands answers to the questions asked in GOA’s original notice to Merrick Garland. This includes confirmation that:

Congresswoman Greene issued the following statement:

“The corrupt officials at the FBI must be held accountable to American taxpayers. This egregious violation of Americans’ constitutional rights cannot be allowed to stand. I will always defend the rights of Americans to keep and bear arms.”

14 additional Members of Congress signed on to Congresswoman Greene’s letter.

Congressman Chip Roy said, “Despite a few examples of clearly troubled individuals being coerced to sign these forms, the Biden DOJ cannot preemptively take away rights before a crime is even committed. This apparent constitutional due process violation is yet another example of FBI’s brazen efforts to target certain Americans this administration doesn’t like.

If the American people ever put Republicans back in the Majority, we should use it to force the administration to answer about where these forms came from and exactly how they have been used. Further, we shouldn’t agree to one additional penny for the FBI until we have answers on this and the growing laundry list of the Biden DOJ's other apparently politicized enforcement actions.”

“The FBI’s efforts to pressure Americans to relinquish their Second Amendment rights is appallingly corrupt and warrants swift congressional oversight,” said Congressman Andrew Clyde. “I’m proud to join Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene in demanding accountability and ensuring unelected, anti-gun bureaucrats do not further infringe on Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms.”

This letter is one of many actions taken by Congresswoman Greene to point out the two-tiered justice system running unchecked in the United States. The system designed to protect American citizens has catastrophically failed.

“The Biden Administration is hellbent on circumventing Congress and our Constitution to infringe on Americans’ Second Amendment Rights,” said Congressman Lance Gooden. “I am proud to stand with Congresswoman Greene as we fight back against these unlawful attacks on law-abiding Americans.”

Congressman Paul Gosar said, “Our Founding Fathers ensured gun ownership in the Bill of Rights, making the right to defend one’s freedom from oppressive government uniquely American. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is engaged in an unprecedented assault on the Second Amendment and the FBI’s latest strong-arm tactics represent the greatest expansion of government infringing upon the rights of law-abiding gun owners in the United States.”

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene filed H. Res. 1318, articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland for his weaponization of the Department of Justice against Joe Biden's chief political opponent, President Donald J. Trump.

Congresswoman Greene released the following statement: 
"Merrick Garland has weaponized the DOJ and unleashed the FBI to target, harass, and persecute Joe Biden’s political enemies.

The unprecedented raid on President Trump’s home is the type of tyrannical action that happens just before a country falls into a violent dictatorship.

Our justice system should never be used to intimidate political opposition simply because the party in power is afraid to lose that power. In this case, abusing the DOJ to prevent President Trump from heading back to the White House.

The Attorney General’s actions are a disgrace and a stain on our great nation. Merrick Garland should be impeached, convicted, and removed from office."

Currently, Representatives Andy Harris, Clay Higgins, and Mary Miller are cosponsors.

Title: BILL ANNOUNCEMENT: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces 21st Century FREE Speech Act To Abolish Section 230
Date: Washington, DC, April 28, 2022
Tags: No tags found

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the 21stCentury FREE Speech Act to put the American people—rather than Big Tech corporations—in charge of what they say or hear in today’s public square. Congresswoman Greene is partnering with Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) to pass the bill in both the House and Senate. This bill adopts the straightforward approach of ensuring that Americans have reasonable, non-discriminatory access to social media platforms, just as they do for other common carriers like telephone, transportation, and electric services.

Americans today use major technology platforms to communicate and consume information. These platforms are owned by large technology corporations that dominate their markets and use opaque, inconsistent moderation practices, allowing them to control the information presented and discussed in the modern public square.The 21stCentury Free Speech Act (HR 7613) would solve this issue by:

Providing Reasonable, Non-Discriminatory Access:

Ensuring Consumer Transparency:

Creating a Private Right of Action:

Abolishing Section 230:

Congresswoman Greene and Senator Hagerty issued the following statements:“For too long Big Tech oligarchs in Silicon Valley have silenced patriotic Americans for simply speaking the truth. The unholy union of the Silicon Valley Cartel and Communist Democrats must finally be broken. Our country needs more freedom of speech and more information not less of it. Big Tech’s tyrannical control over the public square must be stopped and the right to speak must be restored,” saidCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. “The people of Northwest Georgia elected me to be their voice. When I got kicked off Twitter, they kicked me off not because they hate me but because they hate the People of Northwest Georgia and every American who shares our values. It is time to put the American people back in charge of free speech. The 21st Century FREE Speech Act accomplishes just this, and I am proud to partner with Senator Hagerty to pass this bill in both chambers of Congress.”

“It’s long-past time that Congress abolish Section 230, rein in dominant Big Tech companies, and put the American people back in charge of what they say and hear in the modern public square,” saidSenator Bill Hagerty. “Freedom of speech and the exchange of ideas is something to be celebrated. Telephone companies do not shut off your phone line based on what political views you express during calls and that same commonsense logic should apply to Big Tech. I’m pleased that Rep. Greene is introducing the 21st Century FREE Speech Act in the House of Representatives, and I look forward to working with her to stop this un-American censorship.”Adam Candeub, Senior Fellow at Center for Renewing Americaissued the following statement:“This bill reflects a strong, principled way forward to guarantee that all Americans of all political, religious, and social viewpoints and beliefs have access to dominant internet platforms. The federal government must take action to make sure that unreasonable discrimination does not shut out certain groups or viewpoints of the ‘modern public square.’ Center For Renewing America is excited that Representative MTG is pushing forward one of the most thoughtful proposals to emerge from Congress.”

Title: NEW BILL: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces “Congressional Voting Accountability Act” To Force Roll Votes on Everything
Date: Washington, DC, March 9, 2022
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the Congressional Voting Accountability Act to hold Members of Congress accountable to their constituents. This resolution ends the practice of legislation passing the House of Representatives by voice vote, eliminates all forms of proxy/remote voting, and requires all members to vote either “yes” or “no” on every question before the House.

Over the past few years, bills and amendments have passed the House of Representatives by voice vote with only a handful of Members present. By using this tactic, the Uniparty in Congress ensures that their constituents cannot see how they have voted on key legislative questions. The Congressional Voting Accountability Act addresses this problem and holds Congress accountable to the people.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“For too long the Uniparty in Congress has escaped accountability for actions that destroy the American way of life by passing legislation in an empty chamber with no Members on record.

The people of Northwest Georgia sent me to Washington to hold Congress accountable for its actions. Legislation affecting the entire nation should not pass the House without a recorded vote. Constituents have a right to know how their Representative voted.

It is critical for our country that the people have the right information about the individuals they elect to represent them. It is time that we put people over politicians and the Congressional Voting Accountability Act helps do just that.”READ THE FULL TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION HEREREAD BILL SUMMARY HERE

Landerkin has endorsed numerous statements which are blatantly anti-American and reprehensible: among others, equating Christians to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), stating that Ashli Babbitt was responsible for being shot on January 6, labeling the President a “f**king Republican hypocritical piece of sh*t” and “a pig,” abolishing the electoral college, and advocating that Speaker Pelosi punish Republican Members of Congress for objecting to the certification of electoral ballots by not seating them as duly-elected Representatives. 
"Kathleen Landerkin is the Deputy Warden of the D.C. Jail in charge of the unit housing the January 6th pre-trial detainees. She calls them white supremacists. She hates President Trump and hates anyone who supports him," Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said in a statement regarding her letter.

Congresswoman Greene continued, "This is the woman in charge of the atrocious conditions that I witnessed when I toured the jail after she locked me out on several attempts to conduct oversight. Kathleen Landerkin should be fired immediately."

The 14 signers of the letter strongly implore Mayor Bowser to remove Landerkin from her critical position. Her biased comments over the better part of the last decade would evoke serious concerns from the American people, who are watching the treatment of inmates—inmates who are presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
"Deputy Warden Landerkin has expressed hatred for supporters of former President Trump, and she should be removed from her position of trust that has allowed her to oversee abuse of Trump supporters in the DC Jail," said Congressman Louie Gohmert. "Since she has expressed her motivation so starkly for the way the January 6 inmates have been treated, their complaints need to be given full consideration and appropriate response after she is removed from her position." 
"Deputy Warden Landerkin has failed to perform her duties. She has shown bias against Trump supporters and that bias is reflected in her unsatisfactory work. She deserves termination," said Congressman Matt Gaetz. 
"Mayor Bowser and the Board of Ethics must review the vitriolic and irrational communications and conduct from Deputy Warden Landerkin in light of the ethics rules requiring professionalism. Landerkin should be terminated immediately," said Congressman Paul Gosar. 
"Deputy Warden Landerkin’s behavior and stated views are contrary to a fair and unbiased justice system," said Congressman Bob Good. 
"Deputy Warden Landerkin is using her position to torture her political opponents in a system where justice is supposed to be blind," said Congresswoman Mary Miller. 
"The Constitution set out to establish a system where justice would be delivered swiftly, impartially, and the severity of the punishment would be equal to the severity of the crime—absent of any cruel and unusual punishment,” Congressman Michael Cloud said. "Deputy Warden Landerkin has not lived up to the Constitutional standard. She‘s instead demonstrated extreme personal bias in subjecting non-violent first time offenders who trespassed on the Capitol at a greater level than many of the most heinous criminals. She must be removed."

The letter to Mayor Bowser demanding Landerkin's termination was signed by the following Members of Congress:

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14)Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01)Rep. Matt Gaetz (FL-01)Rep. Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04)Rep. Bob Good (VA-05)Rep. Andy Harris, M.D. (MD-01)Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05)Rep.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Three Impeachment Resolutions Against Joe Biden
Date: Washington, DC, August 20, 2021
Tags: No tags found

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced three impeachment resolutions against Joe Biden for his dereliction of duty in Afghanistan, his violations of immigration law causing a national security crisis on our Southern border, and his usurping of the Constitutional balance of power by ignoring the ruling of the Supreme Court.

Congresswoman Greene released the following statement: 
"In seven short months, Joe Biden has caused America to lose the respect of the entire world. The evidence is clear and his actions are so egregious that he must be impeached.

In Afghanistan, Biden's woke generals tucked their tail and ran. He dishonored the sacrifices made by every American soldier who fought in the 20-year war, especially those who gave their life for the cause. Biden left behind over 10,000 American citizens to face the terrifying rule of the Taliban as they impose Sharia law across the country. No commander-in-chief should leave Americans behind in the aftermath of a failure.

On our Southern border, Joe Biden has allowed hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of illegal aliens into our country. His administration, along with Kamala Harris, has violated our immigration laws, deprived our Border Patrol of manpower and resources, and created a national security crisis by allowing unknown foreign nationals into our country who wish to do harm to Americans.

Across the country, Americans are facing an economic crisis created by tyrannical Democrat politicians. Joe Biden, acting as a pseudo-dictator, has ignored the Supreme Court and issued his own eviction moratorium. He is shredding the Constitution and usurping the balance of power by issuing an edict the Supreme Court declared was a power of Congress.

This is a process no one wants to go through, but it is a necessary process for the safety and security of the country and the American people.

We are a nation in distress. Our foreign allies and even our own citizens can no longer trust our government in the hands of Joe Biden. It's the duty of Congress to hold the president accountable when he puts our nation at risk and ignores the rule of law.

Currently, our government is illegitimate because it is no longer serving its citizens. We have to restore respect for America in order for our allies and our citizens to trust the government.

Joe Biden must be impeached, tried in the Senate, convicted, and removed from office."

Title: BILL ALERT: 'Brian A. Terry Memorial Eliminate The ATF Act' Introduced by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene
Date: Washington, DC, June 17, 2021
Tags: Second Amendment

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the 'Brian A. Terry Memorial Eliminate the ATF Act' (H.R. 3960) to end the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms' war on law-abiding gun owners and the Second Amendment.

Congressmen Ralph Norman (SC-5), Paul Gosar (AZ-4), and Matt Gaetz (FL-1) have joined Congresswoman Greene as original cosponsors.

The Brian A. Terry Memorial Eliminate the ATF Act:

Congresswoman Greene issued the following statement: 
"Joe Biden and the radical, anti-gun Democrats want to unleash the ATF on law-abiding gun owners across America, attacking our God-given Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

The ATF's ongoing, unconstitutional attacks on the Second Amendment must end.

12 years ago, under the direction of hate America leftist Eric Holder, the ATF smuggled firearms to Mexican drug cartels (Operation Fast & Furious) who then used those firearms to kill American hero Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.

This can NEVER be allowed to happen again.

Joe Biden's nomination of gun-grabber David Chipman, who wants to ban, confiscate, and destroy the most popular self-defense and hunting rifle in America owned by millions of American patriots, is a clear indication that the ATF's war on gun owners is just beginning and is about to crank up.

I'm introducing this legislation to Eliminate the ATF to protect ALL gun owners across this country from a tyrannical, power hungry group of bureaucrats who's goal is to destroy our Second Amendment rights."

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Issues Statement On The Media's Cover Up Of Democrat Anti-Semitism
Date: Washington, DC, May 25, 2021
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement: 
"The media and Democrats and everyone feeding into it is allowing them to hide the truth, which is the disgusting anti-Semitism within the Democrat Party.

At a time when the Socialist Democrats and the Jihad Squad are supporting terrorist Hamas, and their supporters are attacking Jewish people on the streets of America, it's never been more important than now to stand up against forced vaccinations and mask mandates that the left is using to discriminate against Americans who refuse to comply.

Their attempts to shame, ostracize, and brand Americans who choose not to get vaccinated or wear a mask are reminiscent of the great tyrants of history who did the same to those who would not comply.

And everyone feeding into it is allowing them to hide the truth, which is the disgusting anti-Semitism within the Democrat Party.

The Democrats are the party of division, hate, critical race theory (pure racism), discrimination, totalitarianism, socialism, globalism, gender destruction, BDS, defunding our police, and ANTIFA / BLM terrorists.

I'm sorry some of my words make people uncomfortable, but this is what the American left is all about.

And they are America last in every single way."

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to push America First policies to fight against hate America Democrat policies by signing onto Rep. Dan Bishop’s (R-NC) “Stop CRT Act”, which prevents any taxpayer dollars from being used to advance the ideas associated with Critical Race Theory (CRT) and would codify President Trump's Executive Order to prevent agencies from using CRT in their trainings.

Previously, Congresswoman Greene cosponsored Rep. Chip Roy’s (R-TX) “Combatting Racist Training in Education Act”, which prohibits federal funds from going to any elementary, secondary school, or institution of higher education that promotes race-based theories.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene released the following statement:

“The Democrats continue to push critical race theory onto our elementary children, our college students, and now onto our military. Critical race theory is racist. It does nothing to bring us together. CRT divides and spews hatred. It’s racist to teach children to treat other children differently because of their skin color. Our tax dollars should not be funding these racist ideologies.

I ask everyone to join together -- Republicans, Democrats, Independents and “I Don’t Cares” -- to stand against racism of all kinds. Every kind of racism. Stand together against this kind of racism: critical race theory.”

Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene filed her resolution (H. Res. 327) to expel Rep. Maxine Waters from Congress for her years of inciting violence, rioting, and a drive-by shooting against National Guardsmen in Minnesota.

The case against Democrat Maxine Waters inciting violence and terrorism is extensive and thorough:

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene released the following statement: 
"Democrat Maxine Waters stood in the streets of Minnesota while breaking curfew and inciting riots that led to gunshots being fired at National Guardsmen.

She ordered Black Lives Matter terrorists to 'stay in the street' and 'get more confrontational.'

What’s more confrontational than burning cities for almost a year?

What’s more confrontational than thugs and criminals looting our businesses?

What’s more confrontational than killing innocent Americans like David Dorn?

This is nothing new from Maxine Waters. She has been inciting violence and terrorism for the last 29 years.

It's time to EXPEL Maxine Waters!"

As a sitting United States Congresswoman, Rep. Maxine Waters threatened a jury demanding a guilty verdict and threatened violence if Chauvin is found not guilty. This is also an abuse of power.

"For the past year, most of America has been closed. If any place in America needs to close, it is Congress.

Every day that the House of Representatives is open is another day with the Democrats’ progressive wish list shoved down our throats:

With the woke progressive fire hose spraying on and on and on, my Republican colleagues are constantly saying they want to stop the Democrats. But when the time comes to stop them, it’s business as usual for some.

As Republicans, we should use every single tool we have to stop this Hate America Socialist agenda. Every second, every hour, and every day we can stop radical Democrat policies, Republicans should do it.

That’s why I called for a motion to adjourn, to SHUT DOWN Congress and put a stop to the Democrats’ radical agenda.

Yet some Republicans are so annoyed at the inconvenience of voting, they are putting their personal schedules ahead of the wishes of the People who put them in office.

By voting against my motion to adjourn, some of my Republican colleagues are siding with the Democrats and enabling their policies that will destroy America.

Title: Protecting Your Gun Rights: Congresswoman Greene Introduces Gun Owner Privacy Act
Date: Washington, DC, February 18, 2021
Tags: Second Amendment

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) delivered again for Americans and the Second Amendment by introducing the Gun Owner Privacy Act (GOPA). This pro-gun legislation ensures that gun ownership is not monitored and logged by the federal government, and provides legal recourse by allowing damages to be collected by citizens whose rights have been violated.

As Democrats in Congress push for registration and licensing of firearms with H.R. 127, GOPA will prohibit such a gun control scheme by providing legal protections for Americans. The Gun Owner Privacy Act (GOPA) prevents the government from unlawfully compiling and storing data from background checks on gun owners.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“The right to keep and bear arms is a God-given right protected by the Constitution. I'm proud to stand up and defend against threats to our Second Amendment rights in Congress. That's what the people of Northwest Georgia sent me to do.

The Gun Owner Privacy Act protects the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the Feds from collecting data to monitor and log gun ownership in America. This legislation will give Americans legal recourse and the ability to sue the Feds and collect damages for records illegally stored.

Privacy is critical to every free nation, but currently Democrats in Congress with the backing of the White House have introduced legislation (H.R. 127) which would strip that right of privacy and make gun owners targets of a tyrannical government."

Congressmen Scott Perry (PA-10) and Thomas Massie (KY-4) have joined Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) as cosponsors of GOPA.

Title: ‘Put Americans First,’ Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Signs Letter Addressing President Biden on Open Border Policies
Date: Washington, DC, February 10, 2021
Tags: Congress

Content:
This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene joined Rep. Chip Roy’s (TX-21) letter addressing the Biden administration’s reckless and dangerous Open Borders policy that creates an express lane for illegal aliens into America.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene released the following statement: 
"As I’ve said repeatedly, Joe Biden in the White House is a threat to America’s safety and security. His radical and dangerous border policy is the perfect example. Illegal aliens knew President Joe Biden would open our southern border WIDE OPEN. The flood of adult aliens illegally crossing our border with Mexico, has increased by 178% to 180,633 individuals in the first three months of fiscal year 2021. Drug overdoses are one of the #1 silent killers in the United States. President Biden will allow this epidemic to continue by allowing our borders to be wide open.

When will American Lives matter? When will Kate Steinle and Chrishia Odette’s deaths matter? Kate Steinle, who was murdered on a pier in California. She died in her father’s arms. Chrishia Odette’s father served our country with four tours in the Middle East to protect our freedoms. When he came back home, his daughter was killed by an illegal alien in Texas.

But it’s much worse than that. For decades now, this government has sold out our American worker, sent our jobs overseas to foreign countries. We’ve opened our borders wide open to be flooded with illegal aliens coming into our country. This is the precedent that has been, and it will continue to happen unless we secure our border.

President Biden should put Americans First.”

Title: Congresswoman Greene Cosponsors Legislation to Prevent Hate America Flags From Flying Over American Embassies
Date: Washington, DC, February 1, 2021
Tags: Congress

Content:
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene continues her America First Agenda by cosponsoring Rep. Jeff Duncan’s Old Glory Only Act (H.R. 85), which would ensure that only the American flag flies over U.S. embassies.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“During my campaign for Congress, I promised that I would always put America First. That means that only the Stars and Stripes should fly over our embassies in foreign countries. President Biden's State Department has already raised a flag over our embassies that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans.

In the past, rogue members of the State Department flew the flag of the radical Marxist group, Black Lives Matter. The domestic terrorists represented by that flag have burned down our cities with the mission of defunding our police. We should NOT be flying a flag of a group who wants to erase our history and bring mass destruction to our country through Communism.

The federal government should only be flying the flag that represents ALL people, the American flag. We need to bring back pride in our country and raise the Star Spangled Banner proudly. Old Glory represents our great American military and their sacrifices to ensure our freedom. This isn’t a political issue. This is about Patriotism, and we need more of it."

This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene took a stand for women and girls in America by originally cosponsoring Rep. Greg Steube'sProtection of Women and Girls in Sports Actto prohibit men from unfairly competing against women in sports.

This legislation would enact Title IX protection to recognize the sex of athletes at birth and stop the dangerous trend of biological males infiltrating women's sports to achieve a competitive advantage.

Congresswoman Greene issued the following statement: 
"As a former competitive athlete and a mother to a daughter who is a D1 collegiate athlete, I staunchly oppose biological males in girls/women’s sports, locker rooms, and bathrooms.

This completely violates women’s rights in every way. Women's sports should be women's sports."

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against President Joe Biden
Date: Washington, DC, January 21, 2021
Tags: Congress

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden for his corrupt actions involving his quid pro quo in Ukraine and his abuse of power by allowing his son, Hunter Biden, to siphon off cash from America’s greatest enemies Russia and China.Congresswoman Greene released the following statement: 
"President Joe Biden is unfit to hold the office of the Presidency. His pattern of abuse of power as President Obama's Vice President is lengthy and disturbing. President Biden has demonstrated that he will do whatever it takes to bail out his son, Hunter, and line his family's pockets with cash from corrupt foreign energy companies.

President Biden is even on tape admitting to a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government threatening to withhold $1,000,000,000 in foreign aid if they did not do his bidding. President Biden residing in the White House is a threat to national security and he must be immediately impeached."The case against President Joe Biden is vast and detailed:

Joe Biden abused the power of the Office of the Vice President, enabling bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors, by allowing his son to influence the domestic policy of a foreign nation and accept various benefits—including financial compensation—from foreign nationals in exchange for certain favors.

The evidence of widespread knowledge, corruption, and collusion on behalf of the Biden family with foreign nationals is clear and compelling.

As Vice President, Joe Biden was the senior Obama Administration official overseeing anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Hence, any illegal activity involving corruption conducted by Hunter Biden within or in relation to Ukraine would fall under the purview of the Office of Vice President Biden and the Obama State Department’s anti-corruption efforts. In fact, many State Department officials within the Obama Administration repeatedly registered reservations about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a corrupt company. Thus, any instances of corruption on behalf of Hunter Biden via his role as a board member of the Ukrainian-operated Burisma energy firm were intentionally not investigated or covered up.

In 2016, Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had an active and ongoing investigation into Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter Biden continued to serve on Burisma’s board of directors. According to news reports, then Vice-President Biden “threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss [Shokin].” After that, Ukraine’s Parliament fired Shokin.

During his father’s vice presidency, Hunter Biden built many business relationships with foreign nationals and received millions of dollars from foreign sources, seemingly in exchange for access to his father. The financial transactions which Hunter engaged in illustrates serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.

President Biden gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. Through blatant nepotism, he enabled his son to influence foreign policy and financially benefit as a result of his role as Vice President. He supported his son engaging in collusion with Chinese Communist party-linked officials. He allowed his son to trade appointments with his father and other high-ranking administration officials in exchange for financial compensation. He permitted his son to take money from Russian oligarchs, including Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.

Title: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Continues Her Mission To END Abortion in America By Cosponsoring Critical Pro-Life Legislation
Date: Washington, DC, January 15, 2021
Tags: Protecting The Unborn

Content:
Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene continued her mission to end abortion in America by becoming an original cosponsor to Rep. Alex Mooney’s Life at Conception Act (H.R. 616) and Rep. Ann Wagner’s Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (H.R. 962).

Congresswoman Greene announced her support of this life saving legislation that brings our nation closer to ending abortion:

“My number one priority is to end the genocide of abortion. Killing a baby in the womb is the worst lie sold to women and it doesn’t solve problems, nor is it women’s ‘healthcare.’

Abortion is the most vile evil committed in America. I’m proud to cosponsor the Life at Conception Act which grants rights to babies at the moment they are conceived, and the Born Alive Protection Act, that will protect innocent lives who miraculously escape death.

Becoming an original cosponsor to these vital pieces of legislation is just the beginning of my mission to end abortion in America. More powerful pro-life legislation is on the way.”

The Life at Conception Act (H.R. 616):

·.Declares and codifies that each human being is guaranteed the right to life under the U.S. Constitution at all stages of life.

The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (H.R. 962):

·Establishes pro-life standards for the degree of care a health care practitioner must exercise in the event a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion.

·Imposes legal repercussions to anyone who intentionally kills or attempts to kill a child born alive after an abortion.

·Requires the health care practitioner who is present to exercise the same degree of care to a child born alive in the same gestational age to a hospital.

·Gives women who undergo or attempt an abortion the right to file a civil action for damages against an individual who violated this bill.

Title: Congressional Democrats Threaten Yet Another Coup Attempt Against President Donald Trump
Date: Washington, DC, January 11, 2021
Tags: Congress

Content:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJANUARY 8, 2021Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene released the following statement on the Democrat threat of Impeachment:“For the entire four years of the greatest Presidential term of our lifetime, Democrats led by Speaker Pelosi and radical Socialists in her party attempted coup after coup against President Donald Trump.

Whether it was threatening to remove the President with phony 25th Amendment attacks, ridiculous Russian collusion conspiracy theory lies, or false criminal accusations about a perfect phone call with the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Democrats tried to overturn the 2016 election because they simply couldn’t handle the results.

Not only have the radicals in the Democrat Party tried to throw out the will of the American people, they have attacked anyone who dares support this President.

Everyone remembers the last four years of political censorship by the Silicon Valley Cartel targeting President Trump and his millions of supporters. Everyone remembers the occupation of the Senate office buildings by the Communist Women’s March screaming lies about Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Everyone remembers the harassment of Republicans including Senator Rand Paul, who was surrounded by a violent Black Lives Matter mob in the streets of Washington, DC. And, of course, everyone remembers the entire year of domestic terrorism conducted by Antifa / BLM militants, and championed by Democrat elected officials.

Now, 12 days before the 2021 Presidential Inauguration, these same Democrats, following their marching orders from the activist spokesmen in the Fake News Media, are launching another lie-filled assault on our Republic by threatening to impeach our duly-elected President, yet again.

Speaker Pelosi’s pursuit of impeachment will not “heal and unite” this nation as Joe Biden has called for in speeches. Another coup attempt will only further inflame half of the country.

This Hail Mary attempt to remove President Trump is another attack on the Silent Majority that Democrats have always looked down upon.

I have a message for Democrats, including Joe Biden: the time of demeaning and destroying conservative Americans simply for their beliefs has come to an end.

The new generation of MAGA Republicans will not back down to your threats. We will not back down from the smear campaigns from the Enemy of the American People, the Fake News. And we will not be silenced by Big Tech who wants to end free speech.

We will stand up and defend the 75 Million Americans who you are trying to cancel and ruin the lives of for daring to reject your Marxist ideology.

President Trump taught us how to defend our values.

We aren’t going away. We will never give up.

America First. Always.”###

Rome, GA– Incoming Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene released the following statement on today's Electoral College vote in Georgia: "The Republican slate of electors in our great state of Georgia showed unprecedented courage in casting their votes for the rightful winner of Georgia, President Donald Trump.

Without the widespread voter fraud, out-of-state voters, mail-in ballots from dead people, and “discovery” of hidden ballots, we all know that President Trump wins our state in a landslide.

The brave men and women who recognized the theft of our election system in Georgia by Joe Biden and the rest of the Radical Socialist Democrat Party should be supported and thanked for their bravery to cast their votes for the President.

These Republicans refuse to allow our election to be stolen and I will continue that fight in Washington D.C. on January 6th when I join my colleague Rep. Mo Brooks to reject fraudulent electoral votes from crucial states who ignored state and federal law to change the manner in which our elections have been conducted for hundreds of years.

This fight isn’t over. It’s just begun."
