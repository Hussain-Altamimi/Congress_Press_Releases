Title: Hawley Releases New Whistleblower Claims Alleging Secret Service Director’s Role in Scaling Back Agency’s Manpower, Retaliating Against Agents who Speak Out
Date: Thursday, August 01, 2024

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe after new whistleblower claims
point to his actions as a reason for the agency’s failures to protect former President Donald Trump.
“Since your testimony before the Senate of July 30, new and disturbing information has come to light about Secret Service planning for the Butler, Pennsylvania Trump campaign event—and your own involvement,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“The whistleblower further alleges that you personally directed significant cuts to CSD, up to and including reducing the division’s manpower by twenty percent,”
Senator Hawley continued.
“The whistleblower also alleges retaliation against those within the Secret Service who expressed concern about the security at President Trump’s events.”
Senator Hawley’s letter
follows
his heated
exchange
with Rowe this past Tuesday, when the Acting Director
confirmed
that the Secret Service did, in fact, refuse drones from local law enforcement—a detail brought to light by a whistleblower in contact with Senator Hawley’s office.
Acting Director Rowe also
acknowledged
other whistleblower allegations brought to Senator Hawley’s office that claimed agents
abandoned
their post on the roof where Trump’s attempted-assassin shot from due to the heat.

August 1, 2024
The Honorable Ronald L. Rowe, Jr.
Acting Director
U.S. Secret Service
245 Murray Ln SW, Building T-5
Washington, D.C. 20223
Dear Acting Director Rowe,
Since your testimony before the Senate of July 30, new and disturbing information has come to light about Secret Service planning for the Butler, Pennsylvania Trump campaign event—and your own involvement.
A whistleblower has alleged to my office that the Secret Service Counter Surveillance Division (CSD), the division that performs threat assessment of event sites before the event occurs, did not perform its typical evaluation of the Butler site and was not present on the day. This is significant because CSD’s duties include evaluating potential security threats outside the security perimeter and mitigating those threats during the event. The whistleblower claims that if personnel from CSD had been present at the rally, the gunman would have been handcuffed in the parking lot after being spotted with a rangefinder. You acknowledged in your Senate testimony that the American Glass Research complex should have been included in the security perimeter for the Butler event. The whistleblower alleges that because CSD was not present in Butler, this manifest shortcoming was never properly flagged or mitigated.
The whistleblower further alleges that you personally directed significant cuts to CSD, up to and including reducing the division’s manpower by twenty percent. You did not mention this in your Senate testimony when asked directly to explain manpower reductions.
The whistleblower also alleges retaliation against those within the Secret Service who expressed concern about the security at President Trump’s events. The whistleblower claims that following an event with the former President at a golf tournament in August of last year, Secret Service personnel present expressed serious concern that the Secret Service’s use of local law enforcement was not adequate for security needs: local law enforcement were not properly trained for the event or otherwise prepared to execute the tasks given them. Further, Secret Service personnel expressed alarm that individuals were admitted to the event without vetting. The whistleblower alleges that those who raised such concerns were retaliated against.
Please provide the following information to me by no later than August 8, 2024:
1.) All responsive records during your time as Deputy Director in which policy and personnel changes were made to CSD, the Secret Service division that specifically performs advance site threat assessments;
2.) The nature of your personal involvement in revising, updating, or otherwise changing Secret Service policies and personnel related to CSD;
3.) The number of Secret Service agents who have raised concerns about security practices within the Secret Service and are currently facing disciplinary action, as well as the nature of the concerns and the type of disciplinary action; and
4.) The breakdown of Secret Service personnel at the July 13 rally by division or unit.
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Bill Would Strengthen Rural Broadband Buildout, Bring FCC Dollars Back to Missouri
Date: Thursday, August 01, 2024

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
new legislation to help deliver reliable internet to more rural Americans by returning dormant federal funding back to the state it was intended for.
“Missourians and rural Americans across the country are losing out on internet service thanks to failed funding policies,”
said Senator Hawley.
“My bill would put states in charge of their own broadband funding—not government-backed companies that overpromise and under-deliver.”
The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) current funding structure favors large companies that reap billions in federal government contracts meant to provide high-speed internet access to rural communities. These companies, however, often fail to meet obligations, leaving federal funds in default and America’s rural communities without internet service.
So far, the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund has seen more than $2.8 billion in defaulted funds.
Senator Hawley’s
Broadband Fairness Act
would
:
Allocate defaulted FCC funds to the state that originally received the award for broadband deployment;
Ensure that the geographic region where an award defaulted is eligible for other broadband funding opportunities; and
Allow states to supplement other grant funding to complete broadband projects.
The Missouri Farm Bureau has endorsed Senator Hawley’s legislation.

Broadband Fairness Act

Title: Senate Passes Hawley-Backed Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Kids Online, Hold Big Tech Accountable for Child Exploitation
Date: Thursday, August 01, 2024

Content:
This week the Senate passed the bipartisan
Kids Online Safety Act
(KOSA), cosponsored by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), to fight back against Big Tech’s targeting of kids online.
“Despite Big Tech’s endless lobbying, the Senate has taken a serious first step this week toward keeping kids safe online. The next step is to take the fight to the platforms—to give parents the right to sue. America’s sons and daughters deserve justice, not exploitation,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley has led the charge to hold Big Tech companies accountable for their platforms’ harmful algorithms and prolific dissemination of child sexual abuse material since coming to the U.S. Senate.
In January of this year, Senator Hawley
forced
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to apologize to families of child exploitation victims during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after citing horrifying statistics of minors’ interactions with sexually explicit material on Facebook and Instagram.
Senator Hawley has worked across the political aisle to
advance
the
STOP CSAM Act
which would crack down on child sexual abuse material social media channels host online.
He also
introduced
the
Parental Data Rights Act
this Congress, legislation that would require Big Tech companies to give parents control over their children’s data and hold accountable companies that fail to comply.
The Senator continues to
fight
for victims’ rights to sue social media platforms that knowingly host CSAM in an effort to put power back in consumers’ hands.

Title: Hawley, Gillibrand Introduce Bill Boosting Mental Health Resources for First Responders
Date: Wednesday, July 31, 2024

Content:
Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced the bipartisan
First Responders Wellness Act. The bill would establish a new grant program to boost mental health and wellness resources for law enforcement. It would also direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national mental health hotline for first responders experiencing a crisis or in need of help.
“I’m proud to partner with Senator Gillibrand on another piece of vital legislation. Our first responders put their lives on the line every day for us. The least we can do is support them in the halls of Congress,”
said
Senator Josh Hawley.
“Our first responders put themselves in extremely challenging and life-threatening situations in order to keep us safe. Unfortunately, it takes a toll; first responders face higher rates of PTSD and suicide compared to the civilian population,”
said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
“We must support the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting ours. The bipartisan
First Responders Wellness Act
would create a new grant program to provide professional and culturally competent mental health services to law enforcement officers and establish a mental health hotline for the first responder community. I’m proud to work with Senator Hawley on this important legislation and look forward to getting it across the finish line.”
First responders—including our men and women in blue, firefighters, EMS personnel, and public safety telecommunicators—face higher rates of PTSD than civilians. To address this, the
First Responders Wellness Act
would:
Amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to develop a professional program to provide confidential and independent mental health services to law enforcement officers.
Increase the number of mental health service providers available to law enforcement officers.
Establish a first responders mental health hotline to provide peer and emotional support, information, brief intervention, and mental or behavioral health and substance use disorder resources.
Require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit an annual report to Congress on the hotline and its implementation.

Title: ‘No One Has Been Fired’: Hawley Pushes for Accountability from Secret Service on Trump Assassination Attempt
Date: Tuesday, July 30, 2024

Content:
In a joint hearing today with members of the Senate Judiciary and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) confronted United States Secret Service (USSS) Acting Director Ronald Rowe, demanding answers for the lack of accountability in the attempted assassination of former President Trump.
In his questioning, Senator Hawley asked Acting Director Rowe for names of those who were in charge of multiple security efforts the day the former President was shot, and Acting Director Rowe declined to identify them because they “are still operational, still doing investigations.”
“Isn’t the fact that a former President was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded, isn’t that enough mission failure for you to say that [they] should probably be fired?”
Senator Hawley asked. Acting Director Rowe continued to deny identification of those in charge and emphasized that he refrain from making any judgements while the investigation continues.

Senator Hawley continued, “What more do you need to investigate to know that there were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable?”
The Senator has been a leading voice
demanding
accountability for the USSS’ botched security rollout on July 13, and in revealing whistleblower allegations from the
absence
of drone usage to law enforcement officers
abandoning
their posts.

Title: NEW Whistleblower Allegations: Hawley Reveals Secret Service Declined Drone Usage Day of Trump Butler Rally
Date: Thursday, July 25, 2024

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a follow-up letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,
demanding
his agency turn over all records concerning the United States Secret Service’s (USSS) availability or use of drones during former President Donald Trump’s July 13 rally.
Senator Hawley’s letter comes after new whistleblower claims to his office allege that USSS officers at the rally refused to deploy drones—the same technology President Trump’s attempted-assassin used to gauge his shots at the former president—to secure the rally before it began.
“According to one whistleblower, the night before the rally, U.S. Secret Service repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally. This means that the technology was both available to USSS and able to be deployed to secure the site. Secret Service said no,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
His letter also states that, according to the whistleblower, USSS then “changed course” and “asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site,” but only in the aftermath of the attack.
Senator Hawley has been a leading voice
demanding
accountability for the USSS’ botched security rollout on July 13.
Senator Hawley
sent
a separate letter to Secretary Mayorkas earlier this week, demanding answers after other whistleblower allegations suggested law enforcement officers assigned to the roof of the building the attempted-assassin shot from, abandoned their post due to the heat.
Last week, Senator Hawley
traveled
to Butler, PA—the site of the assassination attempt against President Trump—before now-former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle visited it herself.

July 25, 2024
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
Since I last wrote to you on July 22, my office has received new whistleblower allegations that further call into question your department’s preparations. The American people deserve answers about your historic failure to protect former President Trump on July 13, 2024.
According to reports, the shooter used a drone to survey the site in preparation for his attack. This was confirmed by FBI Director Christopher Wray in his testimony just yesterday. In fact, he confirmed that the shooter was operating the drone approximately two hours before President Trump took the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania.
This raises an obvious question: why was the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) not using its own drones?
According to one whistleblower, the night before the rally, U.S. Secret Service repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally. This means that the technology was both available to USSS and able to be deployed to secure the site. Secret Service said no. The whistleblower further alleges that after the shooting took place, USSS changed course and asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site in the aftermath of the attack.
It is hard to understand why USSS would decline to use drones when they were offered, particularly given the fact USSS permitted the shooter to overfly the rally area with his own drone mere hours before event. The failure to deploy drone technology is all the more concerning since, according to the whistleblower, the drones USSS was offered had the capability not only to identify active shooters but also to help neutralize them.
So that Congress can continue its investigation, please provide no later than seven days from now all records and communications concerning the availability or use of drones at the July 13, 2024 rally in Butler, PA. You must also testify before Congress next week about these staggering security failures by your department.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: NEW Hawley Bill Would Declassify Key Docs on Trump Assassination Attempt
Date: Thursday, July 25, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
Trump Assassination Attempt Transparency Act
to require the federal government to declassify any and all information related to the U.S. Secret Service’s preparations for the rally, their interactions with the shooter, and their response to the assassination attempt on July 13.
“We need the truth about the assassination attempt against President Trump. We can’t let the federal government hide behind the ‘classified’ label. This investigation must be done out in the open for the American people to see – no more stonewalling, no more evading questions. Time for accountability,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley has been a leader in fighting for answers following the attempted assassination of President Trump and has
been to the scene
in Butler, Pa., to investigate the scene himself. Multiple whistleblowers have also come forward to Senator Hawley,
confirming
the event was considered a “loose” security event, and that officers were supposed to be stationed on the roof but
left their posts
due to the heat. Senator Hawley has
demanded
that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee launch a comprehensive, transparent investigation into the incident with sworn testimony from DHS and Secret Service officials.
Senator Hawley’s
Trump Assassination Attempt Transparency Act
would:
Require the declassification of all information related to the assassination attempt.
This legislation would require the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to declassify any critical information about the assassination attempt, the motive of the shooter, and requests by former President Trump for additional resources.
Require a report on the assassination attempt.
The legislation also requires the Director of National Intelligence produce a report to Congress on the rally containing and expanding upon the declassified information required by this Act.
Require the Inspector General to certify compliance.
The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community must certify to Congress that the Director of National Intelligence has complied with the bill’s requirements.

Title: Hawley & Peters’ Bipartisan Legislation Banning Congressional Stock Trading Passes Through Committee
Date: Wednesday, July 24, 2024

Content:
Today legislation negotiated by U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.)
passed
out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC)
to ban
stock ownership and trading for sitting members of Congress.
Earlier this month Senators Hawley, Ossoff, Merkley, and Chairman Peters negotiated the
landmark bipartisan agreement. This is the first time a bill banning stock ownership has passed out of committee.
“Members of Congress should not be here to turn a profit on the people’s time. They should certainly not be trading or owning individual stocks, especially not in companies they oversee through their government work. This bill takes a giant step forward to that end, and I’m proud that it has passed through Senator Peters’ committee,”
said Senator Hawley.
The new bipartisan agreement would:
Immediately ban members of Congress, the President, and Vice President from buying and selling covered assets. Covered assets include securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts, and other comparable holdings.
Require elected officials, their spouses, and dependent children to divest covered assets beginning in 2027. There is no blind trust loophole.
Increase penalties for violations of STOCK Act disclosure requirements from $200 to $500.
Senator Hawley has been fighting to stop members of Congress from trading stocks. He has previously introduced the
Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, the
Eliminating Executive Branch Insider Trading Act, and the
Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, demanding answers for new whistleblower information that suggests law enforcement personnel were assigned to be on the roof of the building on the day of President Trump’s attempted assassination, but the post was abandoned.
“Contrary to Director Cheatle’s public statements about the “safety” of the sloped roof of American Glass Research Building 6, one whistleblower with direct knowledge of Secret Service planning for the event alleges that there was supposed to be a law enforcement presence on the roof that day […] but this person abandoned his or her post due to the hot weather,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“The whistleblower further alleges that concerns over the heat prompted law enforcement to forego patrolling Building 6 and instead to station security personnel inside the building,”
Senator Hawley continued.
On Friday, Senator Hawley
was on the ground visiting
the scene in Bulter, Pa. following the attempted assassination of President Trump. Multiple whistleblowers have come forward

Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
Since my last correspondence to you on July 19, additional whistleblowers have contacted my office with troubling information about the assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump.
Contrary to Director Cheatle’s public statements about the “safety” of the sloped roof of American Glass Research Building 6, one whistleblower with direct knowledge of Secret Service planning for the event alleges that there was supposed to be a law enforcement presence on the roof that day. In fact, the whistleblower alleges that at least one individual was specifically assigned to the roof for the duration of the rally, but this person abandoned his or her post due to the hot weather. The whistleblower further alleges that concerns over the heat prompted law enforcement to forego patrolling Building 6 and instead to station security personnel inside the building.
Additionally, I have heard from a DHS official that Homeland Security Investigations has nearly completed a report on its personnel’s involvement in providing security for the July 13 rally. Please furnish a copy of this report to my office immediately.
To inform ongoing investigations, please respond to the following questions by no later than July 26, 2024:
If the whistleblower’s allegations are accurate, when did the individual abandon the post?
Which law enforcement units were assigned to the roof? Please provide all security plans indicating which units were assigned to the roof and the building.
Did any law enforcement personnel fail to report to their assigned stations that day?
I await your response.

“For example, detection canines were not used to monitor entry and detect threats in the usual manner. Individuals without proper designations were able to gain access to backstage areas.

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
I write to raise concerns brought to me by whistleblowers about your department’s stunning failure to protect former President Trump on July 13, 2024. As Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), you are ultimately responsible for your agency and its components, including the U.S. Secret Service (USSS).
Whistleblowers who have direct knowledge of the event have approached my office. According to the allegations, the July 13 rally was considered to be a ‘loose’ security event. For example, detection canines were not used to monitor entry and detect threats in the usual manner. Individuals without proper designations were able to gain access to backstage areas. Department personnel did not appropriately police the security buffer around the podium and were also not stationed at regular intervals around the event’s security perimeter.
In addition, whistleblower allegations suggest the majority of DHS officials were not in fact USSS agents but instead drawn from the department’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). This is especially concerning given that HSI agents were unfamiliar with standard protocols typically used at these types of events, according to the allegations.
As a Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight jurisdiction over your department, I will continue to investigate your department’s role in the staggering security failures on July 13. Unfortunately, your department has not been appropriately forthcoming with Members of Congress—abruptly ending the only call with USSS before most senators could even ask a question. This is completely unacceptable and contrary to the public’s interest in transparency.
Instead, we have learned more from whistleblowers than your department’s officials. I will continue to protect the anonymity and confidentiality of all who contact my office and ensure that they receive the full protections under the law to which they are entitled. So that my office can continue its investigation into the events of July 13, 2024, please provide the following information no later than 7 days from now:
1. How did DHS determine to staff the event, including any decision to rely on state or local officers?
2. What percentage of the DHS agents at the event were from HSI rather than USSS? Were a majority of officers at the event drawn from HSI or other DHS components, rather than USSS? If so, why?
3. Were HSI agents properly trained in staffing these types of events?
4. Did gaps exist in the security perimeter, and were the usual protocols followed for the use of canines and magnetometers?
5. Were agents not appropriately stationed around the podium?
6. Were the standard protocols followed for issuing designated pins to vetted personnel that are allowed backstage?
7. How long did agents physically spend on the ground surveying the site before the event? Did any paperwork obligations prevent a longer and more robust site survey?
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal Demand Answers from AT&T, Snowflake After Massive Data Breach Targets Millions of Customers

U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)—Ranking Member and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, respectively—sent letters to
AT&T
and data cloud company
Snowflake, Inc., demanding answers behind the recent massive data breach that affected millions of subscribers’ cellphone information.
“Taken together, the stolen information can easily provide cybercriminals, spies, and stalkers a logbook of the communications and activities of AT&T customers over several months, including where those customers live and traveled—a stunning and dangerous breach of its customers’ privacy and intrusion into their personal lives,”
the Senators wrote.
“Disturbingly, the AT&T breach appears to have been easily preventable,”
the lawmakers continued.
“While Snowflake, AT&T, and other clients have avoided taking direct responsibility, according to Mandiant, it appears that the cybercrime group behind the breaches obtained companies’ passwords from malware infections, including malware bundled with pirated software.”
The Senators also

concerns over the recent series of data hacks targeting other major Snowflake customers, including Ticketmaster, Advance Auto Parts, and Santander Bank.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: The Promise of Pro-Labor Conservatism
Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2024

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | July 16, 2024 |
Compact Magazine
Suffice it to say, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien’s speech came as something of a shock at the Republican National Convention Monday night. The commentariat couldn’t believe he was there. Many of the delegates couldn’t believe how much they agreed with him. As more than one delegate said to me, “That guy makes a lot of sense.”
No kidding.
The C-suite long ago sold out the United States, shuttering factories in the homeland and gutting American jobs, while using the profits to push diversity, equity, and inclusion and the religion of the trans flag. Once upon a time, the head of General Motors could say, with an entirely straight face, “What’s good for GM is good for America.” Those days are long over.
Many Republican politicians have stupidly gone along with the suits. They have broken the backs of unions at every opportunity. They have forged trade deals that led directly to the hemorrhaging of 4 million good jobs to China. They have watched whole towns fall into decrepitude, and an entire generation of working men falter. In a word, they put money before people. Politicians that claimed to stand for morality instead stood for greed.
But as O’Brien correctly observed Monday night, that isn’t the Republican Party’s true tradition. There was a time when Republicans knew that American strength depends squarely on American workers—and their way of life: family, neighborhood, church, union hall.
[…]
As O’Brien’s appearance Monday night suggested, this is a watershed moment. Thanks to Donald Trump, there is much that Republicans and labor can already agree on. China is ripping us off, and strong tariffs must be maintained and expanded. We ought to support our auto workers with an America First energy policy, rather than kneecapping that storied industry with idiotic electric-vehicle mandates. We should renegotiate trade deals, protect Social Security and Medicare, and initiate antitrust suits against the most egregious corporate abuses.
O’Brien gives us the roadmap to go even further in 2025. And we should. I have stood on the picket line with the UAW and the Teamsters—all Republicans should do it. I voted to stop Amazon’s labor exploitation, give more sick days to rail workers, and worked across the aisle to limit bank-executive pay. Republicans can begin there. But if given power, we should embrace even more. Let’s cap credit-card interest rates, take the fight to Big Pharma, end exploitative forced labor, and rid politics of corporate money once and for all.

Title: Hawley Demands Full-Scale Investigation by Congress into Attempted Assassination of President Trump
Date: Sunday, July 14, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a letter to U.S. Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.), calling on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Chairman to immediately
launch
an investigation into the attempted assassination of former President Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally yesterday.
“This HSGAC investigation must include public testimony, hearings, and robust oversight over the relevant federal departments as they respond to this assassination attempt. Sworn testimony must be heard from Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle. Nothing should be classified or withheld from the public,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Our prayers are with President Trump, the family of the slain American, and the innocent civilians who were injured. We owe it to the victims and the American people to get to the bottom of what happened. The American people have questions. And they deserve answers,”
he concluded.
Senator Hawley previously
released
statements following yesterday’s shooting,
condemning
the political violence and demanding answers from President Biden’s Justice Department on the identity of the shooter.
July 14, 2024
The Hon. Gary Peters
Chairman
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
340 Senate Dirksen Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairman Peters:
Yesterday, the world witnessed an assassination attempt on Donald J. Trump—the former president and presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency. President Trump has stated that he was shot in the upper part of his ear; he was nearly killed. One civilian at the Pennsylvania rally was murdered and two were critically injured. There is no place for this egregious violence in our republic. These events warrant an immediate, comprehensive, and public congressional investigation.
Although we still do not have all the facts, the little that we do know suggests a staggering security failure. Evidently, the shooter was able to gain an elevated position on a rooftop with a clear line of sight of the President, well within accurate range, with a firearm. The details of this tragedy must be vigorously investigated by Congress, including the motive of the shooter, and the serious operational failures that occurred on July 13.
These matters fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC), which includes oversight over the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Secret Service.
I call on you to launch a full, public, and comprehensive committee investigation into this assassination attempt and failures to adequately protect the former president.
This HSGAC investigation must include public testimony, hearings, and robust oversight over the relevant federal departments as they respond to this assassination attempt. Sworn testimony must be heard from Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle. Nothing should be classified or withheld from the public.
Our prayers are with President Trump, the family of the slain American, and the innocent civilians who were injured. We owe it to the victims and the American people to get to the bottom of what happened. The American people have questions. And they deserve answers.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: ‘What World Are You Living In?’: Hawley Rebukes Former NIH Chief For Claiming Zero Censorship Took Place During COVID Peak
Date: Thursday, July 11, 2024

Content:
In a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
questioned
Carrie D. Wolinetz who served as Chief of Staff for former National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins during the peak of COVID-19.
Senator Hawley
pressed
Wolinetz on her claim that censorship did not occur during her tenure at the NIH, specifically referring to questions around the origin of COVID-19.
“You don’t believe censorship took place? What world are you living in?”
Senator Hawley asked Wolinetz.
“Tell that to the scientists who basically lost their credentials. Tell that to the people who were kicked off of social media and banned because they asked about a lab leak. . . . The privilege is astounding.”
Senator Hawley also
called out
Wolinetz and her team of so-called scientists formerly at the NIH for working to discredit the COVID-19 lab leak theory before even testing it as a hypothesis.
“Why was your office so intent on pushing to the public the idea that this could not possibly have been a lab issue?”
he continued.
“Is it because of the NIH’s role in funding gain-of-function research at the lab?”
Last month, Senator Hawley
criticized
professor and scientist Dr. Robert Garry for continuing to peddle propaganda about the origin of COVID-19.

Title: Senator Hawley Delivers National Conservatism Keynote: The Christian Nationalism We Need
Date: Thursday, July 11, 2024

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | July 8, 2024 |
National Conservatism
This week, Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
delivered
a keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference on
The Christian Nationalism We Need. Read Senator Hawley’s full remarks as prepared
here.
Speech excerpts as prepared for delivery:
I want to speak to you tonight about the future. About the future of the conservative movement and of this nation. But every future is rooted in some earlier past—or as Seneca said, “Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.”
[…]
[A]s Rome lay shattered and smoldering, a thousand miles away across the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Christian bishop of Hippo—a man named Augustine—took up his pen to describe a new age. His vision would inspire the West for millennia to come and help define the destiny of this country. He called his work “The City of God.”
[…]
[W]hile Augustine said all nations are constituted by what they love, his philosophizing actually described an entirely new idea of the nation unknown to the ancient world: a new kind of nationalism, if you like—a Christian nationalism organized around Christian ideals. A nationalism driven not by conquest but by common purpose; united not by fear but by common love; a nation made not for the rich or for the strong, but for the “poor in spirit,” the common man.
[…]
We are a nation forged from Augustine’s vision. A nation defined by the dignity of the common man, as given to us in the Christian religion; a nation held together by the homely affections articulated in the Christian faith—love for God, love for family, love for neighbor, home, and country.
And some will say now that I am calling America a Christian nation. And so I am. And some will say I am advocating Christian nationalism. And so I do. Is there any other kind worth having?
The nationalism of Rome led to blood-thirst and conquest; the old pagan tribalisms led to ethnic hatred. The empires of the East crushed the individual, and the blood-and-soil nativism of Europe in the last two centuries led to savagery and genocide.
By contrast, Augustine’s Christian nationalism has been the boast of the West. It has been our moral center and supplied our most cherished ideals. Just think: Those stern Puritans, disciples of Augustine, gave us limited government and liberty of conscience and popular sovereignty.
Because of our Christian heritage, we protect the liberty of all to worship according to conscience. Because of our Christian tradition, we welcome people of all races and ethnic backgrounds to join a nation constituted by common loves.
The truth is, Christian nationalism is not a threat to American democracy. Christian nationalism founded American democracy. And it is the best form of democracy yet devised by man: the most just, the most free, the most humane and praiseworthy.
And my claim to you tonight is that we must recover the principles of our Christian political tradition now for the sake of our future. This is true whether you are a Christian or not, a person of a different faith or none at all. The Christian political tradition is our tradition; it is the American tradition; it is the greatest source of energy and ideas in our politics—and always has been. It has inspired conservatives and liberals, reformers and activists, and moralists and trade unionists down our history. And now we need this grand tradition again.
[…]
God, work, neighborhood, home. The great affections of the West. They are dissolving before our eyes.
And why? Not by happenstance. The modern Left wants to destroy our common loves and replace them with others, to destroy our common bonds and replace them with another faith, to dissolve the nation as we know it, and remake it in their image. This has been their project for 50 years and more.
But it is the Right that is failing this country most acutely.
[…]
In this hour of chaos and crisis, conservatives’ only hope, and the hope of the nation, is to recover the Christian tradition on which this nation subsists.
[…]
For the future, to save this country, this must be our mission: defend the loves that unite our country; defend the loves that make us a country—defend the common man’s work, the common man’s home, and the common man’s religion.
[…]
These are the things we love together. That sustain our common life together. That make us a nation—and provide the ground of our unity.
And this is what Christian nationalism means, in the truest and deepest sense. Not every citizen of America is a Christian, obviously, and never will be. But every citizen is heir to the liberties, to the justice, to the common purpose our biblical and Christian tradition gives us.
[…]
And those great loves on which our nation was founded have not failed. They are as compelling today as they were when Augustine first wrote of them. They are as vibrant now as when the Puritans first set sail for these shores.
We need only recommit ourselves to defending them, to strengthening them—to reviving our devotion. And when we do, we will save the nation.

Title: Hawley Confronts Biden Director Over Admin’s Hostile Takeover of Missouri Family Farms
Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2024

Content:
In a Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs hearing today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
pressed
Eric Beightel, the Biden-appointed Executive Director of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, on his agency’s endorsement of the Grain Belt Express. This green-energy transmission corridor is set to cut across Missouri,
confiscating
farmers’ land in its tracks while failing to adequately compensate landowners.
“Why is it a good idea to go over the heads of the people of Missouri and give this expressway—which is being developed by a private company that’s making probably billions of dollars on it as they take farmers’ land—why is that a good idea?”
asked Senator Hawley.
Watch the full exchange
here
or above.
Senator Hawley also
made
Director Beightel aware that the Grain Belt Express is highly controversial throughout Missouri and farmers in the state strongly oppose the construction of it.
“On behalf of the people from my state, I think it’s outrageous that a private corporation can take this kind of land. We’re talking about a massive corridor right across the central part of Missouri. We’re talking about taking land from farmers whom whose families it has been in for generations,”
Senator Hawley continued.
They don’t hire lobbyists. They don’t appear before your agency—clearly.
Senator Hawley has repeatedly gone to bat for Missouri farmers against the Biden Administration’s hostile takeover of family farms.
Last November, Senator Hawley
sent
a letter to Invenergy CEO Michael Polsky, demanding the private company make commitments to operate in good faith, as well as adequately compensate landowners affected by the Grain Belt Express construction campaign.
Senator Hawley has also
introduced
the
Just Compensation Act of 2023
to prevent the federal government and private companies from confiscating Missourians’ property without adequate compensation.

Title: Hawley Bashes Biden Admin for Prioritizing Ukraine Over Air Defense Against China
Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo)
sent a letter
to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin calling out the Biden Administration’s
prioritization of air and missile defense for Ukraine, while neglecting support for U.S. and Taiwanese forces in the Pacific.
“The tradeoff between sending weapons to Ukraine and supporting U.S. forces and allies in the Pacific can no longer be denied […] The Biden administration’s actions do not just place Taiwan at risk: these actions will endanger U.S. forces in the Pacific. Air and missile defenses are critical to protect U.S. forces from a potential Chinese attack,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “Let us be clear: China, not Russia, poses the greatest threat to American security. This should not be controversial […] If China successfully invades Taiwan, Beijing will be primed to dismantle America’s alliance network in East Asia and eventually dominate the region. And time is short to deter China.”

or below.
July 10, 2024
Honorable Lloyd J. Austin III
Secretary of Defense
U.S. Department of Defense
1000 Defense Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20301
Dear Secretary Austin,
I write with concern over reports that the Biden administration will prioritize the delivery of Patriot, National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), and associated interceptor missiles to Ukraine, even at the expense of the U.S. military and our allies.
The tradeoff between sending weapons to Ukraine and supporting U.S. forces and allies in the Pacific can no longer be denied. Air and missile defenses, above all Patriot and NASAMS systems, are vital to deterring or denying a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This is not news. For years, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense has asked the U.S. to let them purchase additional air and missile defenses to protect themselves from such an invasion. Despite their pleas, this administration has instead prioritized Ukraine. Americans concerned about the state of U.S. deterrence in the Pacific have been repeatedly lectured that there is no tradeoff between Ukraine and Taiwan. Yet while Taiwan enters its third year waiting for $2.81 billion in Patriot-related articles and services via the glacial Foreign Military Sales regime, your Department has sent a third Patriot battery to Ukraine directly from U.S. military stocks, and we now hear the United States will prioritize Ukraine to receive additional Patriot interceptors and other air and missile defenses.
The Biden administration’s actions do not just place Taiwan at risk: these actions will endanger U.S. forces in the Pacific. Air and missile defenses are critical to protect U.S. forces from a potential Chinese attack. China’s rocket forces have greatly advanced in recent years, in both quantity and quality. Within the first hours of an invasion of Taiwan, Chinese missile barrages could successfully strike U.S. bases at least as far as Guam. The U.S. missile defense architecture in the Western Pacific is currently insufficient to deter China from potential attacks in the coming years. Moreover, if the Joint Force is to credibly execute the Joint Warfighting Concept and Agile Combat Employment against China, it needs more air and missile defenses to protect a distributed basing architecture across the Pacific. At a time when air and missile defense stockpiles are dangerously low, sending additional Patriot batteries and interceptors to Europe rather than the Pacific will further embolden China’s ambitions.
This is not the first time the United States has sacrificed air and missile defense in Asia for Ukraine. Last year, this administration pressured Japan and South Korea to send their own stocks of Patriot interceptors to Ukraine. It is no wonder that the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that the United States’ shipments of “existing stocks of weapons and munitions to Ukraine” has “undermin[ed] the island’s [Taiwan’s] readiness” against a Chinese invasion.
Let us be clear: China, not Russia, poses the greatest threat to American security. This should not be controversial: your own Department’s National Defense Strategy affirms that you will prioritize China ahead of Russia, even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite this rhetoric, the Biden administration has repeatedly diverted weapons to Europe and away from Asia.
If China successfully invades Taiwan, Beijing will be primed to dismantle America’s alliance network in East Asia and eventually dominate the region. And time is short to deter China. Last year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified that China will be able to invade, and even seize, Taiwan by 2027—less than three years from today.
These concerns in mind, I request your written responses to the following questions no later than August 9, 2024:
From which intended recipients will air and missile defense systems be diverted to Ukraine? Please include a full list of allies and partners, as well as quantities and types of Patriot, NASAMS, and any other systems.
Given the heavy delays in the defense industrial base already, by how long will this diversion delay U.S. military force development efforts to optimize the Joint Force for a denial defense along the first island chain? Please include assessments with respect to both air and missile defense platforms and munitions stocks.
How does the Joint Force propose to execute the Joint Warfighting Concept—especially Agile Combat Employment—in the Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility against China given the consequent deficiencies in air and missile defense forces?
When can Taiwan expect to receive additional Patriot, NASAMS, and other air and missile defense systems on which it is still waiting?
What is your assessment of the military balance between the United States and China, and U.S. forces’ current ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan?
How would the fall of Taiwan affect America’s ability to deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific? Is DoD developing plans for a scenario in which China has seized Taiwan?

Title: Hawley, Peters, Merkley, Ossoff Announce First-Ever Bipartisan Agreement to Advance Bill Barring Congress Members from Stock Trading
Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2024

Content:
At a bipartisan press conference today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), alongside Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.),
made
the case for banning stock trading for sitting members of Congress and unveiled new legislation to make it a reality. The bipartisan legislation will be considered at the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee business meeting on July 24. This is the first time a Senate committee will move forward to consider legislation banning members of Congress from stock trading.
“Why should members of Congress be spending their time day trading rather than focusing on the priorities the American people sent us here to achieve and focus on?”
Senator Hawley asked.
“Congress should not be here to make a buck. Congress should be here to serve the people,”
he continued.
“There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get and the rest of the American people don’t get.”
The new bipartisan agreement would:
Immediately ban members of Congress, the President, and Vice President from buying and selling covered assets. Covered assets include securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts, and other comparable holdings.
Require elected officials, their spouses, and dependent children to divest covered assets beginning in 2027.
Increase penalties for violations of
STOCK Act
disclosure requirements from $200 to $500.
Senator Hawley has been fighting to stop members of Congress from trading stocks. He has previously introduced the
Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act,
the
Eliminating Executive Branch Insider Trading Act,
and the
Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act.

Title: Hawley Demands Tyson Foods Come Clean About Chicken Plant Closures in Missouri
Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a letter to Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King demanding transparency and accountability after a lawsuit brought against his company alleged that Tyson lied about its intentions to sell its chicken plant in Dexter, Mo., to a competitor.
The letter comes after Senator Hawley
secured
a commitment from King, pledging that Tyson would sell its Missouri plant to any interested party—including a competitor—in an effort to support the more than 2,000 Missourians who lost their jobs.
Senator Hawley has continued to push forward in his fight to protect Missouri farmers and workers from Tyson’s anticompetitive and unethical practices.
Last September, he
introduced
the
Strengthening Antitrust Enforcement for Meatpacking Act
to empower antitrust enforcers to break up giant meatpacking and poultry monopolies and place power back in the hands of Missourians.
He also sent a letter last September to King,
demanding
answers after a disturbing new report from
The New York Times
exposed unsafe, illegal child labor practices within the company.

here
or below.
July 9, 2024
Donnie D. King
Chief Executive Officer
Tyson Foods
2200 W. Don Tyson Parkway
Springdale, AR 72762
Dear Mr. King:
Last summer, your company announced plans to close its poultry plants in Noel and Dexter, Missouri. On September 15, 2023, you personally assured me that you would not prevent a competitor from acquiring these plants. Now, a class-action lawsuit filed against your company alleges that this was a lie.
Your plant closures last year didn’t just affect the plant workers themselves. The closures affected all the farmers who had previously contracted with your company. This recent lawsuit was filed by Grandview Poultry, on behalf of similarly situated chicken farms, who had contracted with Tyson to produce chickens for the processing plant. The farmers built their farms for chicken production in reliance on those contracts. And if Tyson had sold the Dexter plant to a competitor, these farms would have been well positioned to continue in the same business.
That, apparently, did not happen. The lawsuit alleges that your company sold the Dexter plant to Cal-Maine Foods, a non-competitor which does not process broiler chickens, but produces table eggs. Farmers who built their farms for chicken production, reasonably assuming that your company would be there for them or at least not block a sale to a competitor, have now allegedly been left out in the cold.
Crucially, the lawsuit alleges that you “misled” me and Congressman Jason Smith about your intentions for the Dexter plant, and that “internal documents” contravene commitments you made to me and Rep. Smith. However, the key details on this point have been redacted from the publicly available court filings. I understand that this information is currently subject to a protective order issued by the Circuit Court of New Madrid County that would preclude the plaintiffs from disclosing it.
These are serious allegations, and the people of Missouri deserve to know the truth. You should immediately make this redacted information public, and additionally provide my office with an unredacted copy of the class action petition and all internal documents it references. I will follow up with you upon receipt.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Condemns Biden DOJ’s Indictment of Texas Doctor who Sounded Alarm on Illegal Transgender Procedures at Children’s Hospital
Date: Friday, June 21, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray,
denouncing
the Justice Department’s prosecution of Dr. Eithan Haim and requesting all documents related to the agency’s investigation. President Biden’s Justice Department
indicted
Dr. Haim after he blew the whistle on Texas Children’s Hospital for secretly conducting illegal child sterilization surgeries in the name of transgender healthcare.
“This prosecution is intended to silence Dr. Haim, deter future whistleblowers, and allow deception and medical malpractice to continue apace. The Biden Administration is obviously doing this at the behest of far-left activists, whose views on youth gender medicine are wildly out of step with scientific evidence and the emerging medical consensus,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Accountability is coming. You both must immediately take steps to preserve all documents related to this case, in anticipation of future investigation,”
he concluded.
Senator Hawley has previously
fought
against medical abuses at the Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri.
Senator Hawley has also
introduced
the
Protecting Our Kids from Child Abuse Act, which would allow those harmed by gender-transition procedures as minors to bring lawsuits against the participating individuals and entities.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
June 20, 2024
Dear Attorney General Garland and Director Wray:
The world is awakening to the reality that for years, youth gender medicine has gone horribly awry. Countless children—many with mental health conditions—have been subjected to life-altering puberty blockers, sex change hormones, and even surgical interventions without proper screening. Countries including the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Finland have clamped down on these practices. But not you. Instead, you are retaliating against courageous whistleblowers willing to call out this medical malpractice for what it is.
In response to public pressure and legal action by the Texas Attorney General, Texas Children’s Hospital assured Texas lawmakers that it had stopped performing gender treatments on underage children. But that was a lie, as Dr. Haim established. He did so by adducing redacted records that demonstrated the Hospital’s abuses, including the sterilization of underage children. At no point did Dr. Haim reveal confidential patient information.
Nevertheless, DOJ has now prosecuted Dr. Haim for alleged violations of HIPAA, threatening him with ten years behind bars and fines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Significantly, Dr. Haim is only being prosecuted for the way in which he obtained the records in question—not for disclosing any confidential patient information, which he did not do. The information uncovered by Dr. Haim—evidence of a hospital lying to lawmakers about an issue of significant public concern—is critically important for responsible governance. And yet you are attempting to squelch it.
Let’s be clear about what’s happening here. This prosecution is intended to silence Dr. Haim, deter future whistleblowers, and allow deception and medical malpractice to continue apace. The Biden Administration is obviously doing this at the behest of far-left activists, whose views on youth gender medicine are wildly out of step with scientific evidence and the emerging medical consensus. This prosecution is an unconscionable abuse of legal process, in service of shoddy and irresponsible gender ideology.
Accountability is coming. You both must immediately take steps to preserve all documents related to this case, in anticipation of future investigation. In the meantime, please provide copies of all documents relevant to the decision to investigate and charge Dr. Haim.
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: ‘How Can I Believe You?’: Hawley Exposes Biden Judicial Nominee for Lying About Ties to Antisemitic Organization, Support for Far-left Candidate

pressed
one of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees, Karla Marie Campbell, on why she repeatedly lied under oath about her ties to a left-wing organization that has advocated for the abolition of America’s police and the destruction of Israel.

Senator Hawley further signaled his opposition to Campbell’s nomination after she wouldn’t explain her previous financial support for a far-left political candidate who claimed Republican Senators were satanists.
“Either all of these people are liars or you are . . . But given what you’ve told us under oath today, I think the answer is, you are. And, for that reason, you are utterly unqualified to sit on the federal bench,”

Title: Hawley Introduces Legislation to Honor the National Churchill Museum As a National Historic Landmark
Date: Thursday, June 20, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
new legislation to designate America’s National Churchill Museum, located on the Westminster College campus in Fulton, Missouri, as a National Historic Landmark.
On March 5, 1946, Churchill spoke at Westminster College and spoke the famous words, “From Stettin in the Baltic, to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.” In the 1960s, Westminster College set out to celebrate what would be the 20th anniversary of Churchill’s visit, and imported a 17th century church from London to Fulton. The church of St. Mary Aldermanbury was moved stone-by-stone to Westminster’s campus. Reconstruction was completed in 1969, and is today’s location of the museum.
“Nearly 80 years ago, Sir Winston Churchill marked the beginning of the Cold War with his ‘Iron Curtain’ speech in Fulton, Missouri. I am proud to honor one of the world’s greatest leaders, and one of America’s closest allies, with this legislation,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
America’s National Churchill Museum National Historic Landmark Act
would:
Direct the Secretary of Interior to establish America’s National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri as a National Historic Landmark.
A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. There are currently over 2,600 National Historic Landmarks in the United States, including 37 in Missouri.
Direct the National Park Service to conduct a Special Resource Study to consider future potential designations for the site.
Before enacting a law to add a unit, Congress often first enacts a law requiring NPS to conduct a Special Resource Study (SRS) of the area, typically to assess its national significance, suitability and feasibility, and management options.

Title: ‘You’re the Problem’: Hawley Bashes Boeing CEO for Prioritizing Profit over Safety, Transparency, and Quality
Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2024

Content:
Today in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun on Boeing’s safety failures and his lack of accountability as CEO.
“I think the truth is Mr. Calhoun, you’re not focused on safety, you’re not focused on quality, you’re not focused on transparency […] I think actually you’re focused on what you were hired to do which is that you’re cutting corners. You are eliminating safety procedures. You are sticking it to your employees. You are cutting back jobs because you’re trying to squeeze every piece of profit you can out of this company,”
said Senator Hawley.
Watch the full exchange
here
or above.
Senator Hawley pressed Mr. Calhoun on his salary of nearly $33 million while the company under his leadership has persistent quality and safety issues.
He continued, “For the American people, they’re in danger. For your workers, they’re in peril. For your whistleblowers, they literally fear for their lives, but you’re getting compensated like never before.”
In response Mr. Calhoun said, “Senator I don’t recognize any of the Boeing you described.” He continued to say that he was proud of Boeing’s safety record and every action Boeing has taken.
“I think the American public, when they fear to get on their airplanes, they understand your safety record. And frankly sir, I think it’s a travesty that you’re still in your job,”
Senator Hawley concluded.

Title: Hawley Slams Fauci-Aligned Scientist Who Peddled COVID Origins Propaganda and Aided Censorship of Lab Leak Theory
Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2024

Content:
In a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
criticized
professor and scientist Dr. Robert Garry for
continuing
to peddle propaganda about the origin of COVID-19.
“Our own government deliberately withheld information . . . from the American people, tried to propagandize the American people, used the arms and agencies of government to actively censor Americans who dared to question the propaganda,”
Senator Hawley said.
“And they’re
still
lying to us.”
Watch the full exchange
here
or above.
Senator Hawley further
pressed
Dr. Garry on his research work that the Biden administration used to justify its censorship of countless Americans on social media.
“People . . . lost their jobs, they lost their standing, they were kicked off Facebook, they were kicked off Twitter. Do you regret being part of this effort, this propaganda effort?”
asked Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley has a proven track record of fighting for transparency behind the origins of COVID.
In March of 2023, President Biden
signed
Senator Hawley’s
COVID Origins Act
into law. The legislation required the Biden administration to declassify all intelligence related to any potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of the Covid pandemic.
Senator Hawley later
called out
the Biden administration for failing to comply with the
COVID Origins Act
after it only
released
a heavily redacted 10-page document consisting of a cover page and appendix that made up half of the report.
Senator Hawley has also repeatedly held Doctor Anthony Fauci’s feet to the fire on his COVID and gain-of-function lies and has
called for
his resignation since 2021.

Title: Hawley Demands Biden Admin Cease Plans to Give Millions of Illegal Aliens Amnesty
Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
condemning
President Biden’s
latest plan
to offer amnesty to potentially millions of illegal aliens in the United States. Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
called for
an investigation into the Biden Administration’s move to dismiss asylum cases and removal proceedings against more than 350,000 migrants.
“Amnesty for illegal aliens is absolutely unacceptable. It is a lure that will drive millions more illegal immigrants to flood across our southern border. It is a slap in the face to U.S. taxpayers. And it is totally unfair to immigrants who entered the U.S. legally,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “In the months to come, with Congress and the presidency in better hands, we will investigate these lawless plans for amnesty, your ongoing abuse of parole authority, and your dereliction of duty. In the meantime, you must immediately cease all plans to implement amnesty-by-parole. The American people deserve to see how your mass amnesty campaign is making this country less safe.”

June 18, 2024
The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
Amnesty for illegal aliens is absolutely unacceptable. It is a lure that will drive millions more illegal immigrants to flood across our southern border. It is a slap in the face to U.S. taxpayers. And it is totally unfair to immigrants who entered the U.S. legally. But apparently, you and President Biden now plan to do just that. Recent reports suggest that you are developing new plans to offer legal status to over a million illegal immigrants through a “parole in place” program. You must immediately end this latest iteration of your years-long pro-amnesty agenda.
You have made a habit of abusing the parole authority granted by the Immigration and Nationality Act. Immigration parole is narrow authority available in individualized circumstances. But in your hands, the immigration parole power has transformed into an end run around the entire U.S. immigration system, nullifying the framework that Congress—the American people’s democratically elected representatives—actually agreed upon.
By law, parole may be granted for two reasons, and two reasons alone: “urgent humanitarian reasons” and “significant public benefit.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Moreover, parole judgments must be made on a “case-by-case” basis. Id. You have baldly defied all of this. For years now, you have made blanket—not individualized—grants of parole to residents of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador.  And you have likewise failed to abide by the explicit statutory limitations: leaked documents reveal that Jose Ibarra, accused of murdering 22-year-old Laken Riley, was paroled into the country on the basis of “lack of detention capacity.” That is not a permissible basis for parole. Nor, of course, is a brazen across-the-board amnesty, no matter how much you cloak this in the language of “parole-in-place.”
In your hands, parole is just one thing: a get-across-the-border-free card. And you have been handing out those cards to virtually anyone who asks. In light of your abdication of responsibility to enforce the law, President Biden’s recent promises to secure the border should be seen as what they are—empty and meaningless. There will be no securing the border while a parole-based amnesty is on the horizon, and while your Department is dropping immigration cases left and right, which is another one of your strategies to advance an amnesty agenda. Indeed, this latest proposed amnesty is transparently an attempt to curry favor with far-left activist groups, who opposed even President Biden’s toothless rhetoric about border security. In the end, the far left always gets what it wants from this administration—amnesty and a functionally open border.
In the months to come, with Congress and the presidency in better hands, we will investigate these lawless plans for amnesty, your ongoing abuse of parole authority, and your dereliction of duty. In the meantime, you must immediately cease all plans to implement amnesty-by-parole, and must immediately provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with all materials relevant to your Department’s expansion of parole authority. The American people deserve to see how your mass amnesty campaign is making this country less safe.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces Resolution Honoring Natalie and Davy Lloyd
Date: Monday, June 17, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a
resolution
honoring the lives and service of Natalie and Davy Lloyd. The Missouri missionaries were tragically killed last month by gangs while serving in Haiti. The resolution recognizes Natalie and Davy’s efforts in serving the local community in Haiti and honors the incredible legacy the young couple leaves behind.
“All of Missouri mourns the loss of Natalie and Davy Lloyd. They had servants’ hearts, were exceptional missionaries, and great Americans,”
said Senator Hawley.
“They selflessly dedicated their lives to serving the Lord and others, and the U.S. Senate honors their legacy.”
Last month, Senator Hawley
urged President Biden
to mobilize all resources at his disposal to protect the transport of the remains of Natalie and Davy Lloyd as they traveled back home to Missouri from Haiti. Senator Hawley worked closely with the State Department since he first learned the Lloyd’s were in danger. First, to try and provide assistance prior to their death, and then, to bring the Lloyds back home to Missouri.
Read the full resolution
here
or below.
Honoring the lives and service of Natalie and Davy Lloyd and expressing condolences to the family of Natalie and Davy Lloyd.
Whereas Natalie Elizabeth Lloyd—
(1) was born on March 2, 2003, in Joplin, Missouri;
(2) graduated from Ozark Christian Academy and Ozark Bible Institute and College; and
(3) was known for her exceptionally kind heart and love for everyone she encountered and her dedication to caring for children;
Whereas David (referred to in this preamble as “Davy”) Joseph Lloyd, III—
(1) was born on July 3, 2000, in Tulsa, Oklahoma;
(2) grew up in Haiti, developing a heart for the Haitian community; and
(3) graduated from Ozark Bible Institute and College in Neosho in April 2022 and went on to become an effective preacher;
Whereas Natalie and Davy Lloyd were married on June 18, 2022, at the Bible Holiness Assembly of God in Neosho, Missouri;
Whereas Natalie and Davy Lloyd began their married life together in Neosho, Missouri;
Whereas Natalie and Davy Lloyd became full-time missionaries in Haiti in January 2023 with Missions in Haiti, serving the Haitian community and, in particular, Haitian children through a local orphanage; and
Whereas Natalie and Davy Lloyd were tragically killed by unlawful Haitian gangs on May 23, 2024: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) extends heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Natalie and David (referred to in this resolution as “Davy”) Lloyd;
(2) recognizes and honors Natalie and Davy Lloyd as extraordinarily faithful missionaries, exceptional Missourians, and great Americans who selflessly dedicated their entire lives to God and serving others; and
(3) commemorates the amazing work Natalie and Davy Lloyd completed as missionaries in Haiti and the powerful legacy that the young couple leaves.

Title: Hawley Confronts Biden Admin Director for Lying to Congress about Involvement in Tree-Spiking

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
pressed
the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning on lying to Congress about her ties to tree spiking, a form of eco-terrorism that targets the timber industry and could kill or seriously maim blue-collar loggers.
“You just said . . . that you were involved. There were two people convicted in 1989 of putting 500 pounds of spikes in an Idaho forest. . . . You testified that you sent a letter to the Forest Service on their behalf,”
said Senator Hawley.

Senator Hawley further
called out
Director Stone-Manning for failing to comply with federal investigations into her involvement with tree-spiking after she falsely claimed to have never been under investigation at all.
“You lied to this committee in saying that you were never investigated. . . . In fact, you were. You lied to us blatantly—and you know it,”

Title: Hawley Joins Missouri Radiation Advocates to Give Update on RECA Following Senate Lunch with Johnson
Date: Wednesday, June 12, 2024

Today U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
joined
Missouri radiation advocates in the U.S. Capitol to provide an update on his continued push to reauthorize and expand the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) that
lapsed
last week thanks to inaction from House leadership.
Today’s RECA update following a Republican Senate lunch with Speaker Johnson comes after the Speaker
failed
to follow through on his promise to meet with Missouri radiation advocates.
“. . . Now, nobody in my state—nobody in any state—who is sick and dying of cancer, or any other illness caused by radiation, can even apply for relief. And, so far, Speaker Johnson, after promising these survivors that he would meet with them, he has not met with them. . . . He has not addressed the failure of the House to renew and reauthorize RECA,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“We are in overtime here. . . . The program has expired, and it is vital that the House act—and act immediately.”
The Senate has already
passed
Senator Hawley’s proposal to reauthorize and expand RECA twice in strong bipartisan fashion.

Title: Hawley Demands Transparency from Energy Department in Fight For Missouri Farmers Against Federal Government Land Grab
Date: Wednesday, June 12, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a follow-up letter to Energy Secretary Granholm, urging transparency from her Department on its proposed designation of the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC), which is projected to cut across the entirety of Missouri.
“Constituents in my state have rightfully complained that the proposal lacks essential information needed to adequately provide comments on the plan,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“I have previously called on you to rescind this proposal. And that would be the right thing to do. But at the very least, to respond to serious concerns of constituents in my state, you should disclose the exact location of the proposed corridor, notify the affected landowners, and extend the comment period by at least another 45 days. Farmers and landowners should not live in fear that their land may be subject to a federal takeover,”
he concluded.
Last week, Senator Hawley
voted against
a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nominee who failed to oppose the use of federal eminent domain, a mandate which threatens government seizure of Missourians’ land.
Senator Hawley also
sent
a letter to Secretary Granholm and
introduced
new legislation last month to protect Missouri farmers from federal attempts to take over their land.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
June 12, 2024
The Honorable Jennifer Granholm
Secretary
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Ave., S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20585
I write to you once again with concern about the Department of Energy’s proposed National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) designation. The proposed corridor that spans my state is vague, leaving farmers and landowners in my state with unanswered questions. To allow landowners additional time to interpret the proposal, I urge you to extend the 45-day comment period that is currently expected to end on June 24, 2024.
As you know, on May 8, 2024, the Department of Energy released a list of 10 new proposed National Interest Electric Corridors, spanning more than 3,500 miles across the country. The Midwest-Plains Potential NIETC runs from Kansas to Indiana, cutting across the entirety of Missouri. Alarmingly, guidance document provided by the Department of Energy does not specify the exact area covered by the corridor. It only provides an image of the line across the state and explains that the proposed corridor is five miles wide. How are landowners expected to comment on the proposal if they don’t know if it will be on their land?
Constituents in my state have rightfully complained that the proposal lacks essential information needed to adequately provide comments on the plan. The maps provided are simply not specific enough. Landowners should be notified if the proposed route is going to touch their land. Instead, they are left to guess whether or not their land could be taken by the federal government. And they can only be sure that the corridor is on their land when it is finalized.
Further, the Midwest-Plains Potential Electric Corridor appears to span the entire path of the Grain Belt Express and Tiger Connector, a transmission line that farmers in my state have fought for years. In 2022, Missouri passed legislation requiring a proportional amount of energy be dropped in the state and that adequate compensation be granted for eminent domain. Now, a NIETC designation opens the door for the federal government to exercise federal eminent domain for new transmission lines in Missouri without consent of landowners in its path. With the stroke of the pen, your department has jeopardized all of the progress made by farmers in my state.
I have previously called on you to rescind this proposal. And that would be the right thing to do. But at the very least, to respond to serious concerns of constituents in my state, you should disclose the exact location of the proposed corridor, notify the affected landowners, and extend the comment period by at least another 45 days. Farmers and landowners should not live in fear that their land may be subject to a federal takeover. I urge you to listen to them.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Kelly Introduce Bill Boosting Police Recruitment and Retention
Date: Wednesday, June 05, 2024

Content:
Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) introduced the
Educational and Career Opportunities for Public Safety (EdCOPS) Act of 2024.
The bill tackles the recruitment and retainment crisis plaguing local law enforcement agencies across the country and seeks to support them. The
EdCOPS Act of 2024
offers education benefits to police officers and their dependents.
“As crime rates rise and law enforcement agencies experience staffing shortages, Congress must ensure that states have the resources they need to attract and retain high-quality police officers. This bill would do just that by investing in the men and women in blue who keep our communities safe,”
said Senator Hawley.
“As the son of two police officers, I have a personal appreciation for the work local law enforcement do every day to keep us safe,”
said Senator Kelly.
“With the
EdCOPS Act, we’re supporting this crucial work by providing them with academic and career opportunities so they can reach their full potential while serving their communities. This investment will retain valuable officers and help recruit new ones, making our state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies stronger.”
Background:
A 2023 Police Executive Research
study
shows that police agencies are seeing an officer exodus that exceeds replacement rates. According to the study, agencies saw 50 percent more resignations from officers in 2022 than in 2019, and total sworn officer staffing has dropped nearly 5 percent over the past three years.
The
EdCOPS Act
would ensure that a public safety officer who has served for eight years and commits to serving four more for a single employer would be eligible to receive financial assistance to attend a higher education program. Eligible public safety officers can also transfer unused education benefits to their dependent.

Title: Hawley Slams Biden Admin Over Covert Mass Amnesty Scheme for Illegal Migrants

sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas condemning the decision to grant hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants
de facto
amnesty. Recent reporting
revealed that, since 2022, the Biden Administration has closed more than 350,000 asylum cases of migrants, leaving them in the country without requiring them to check in with authorities.
“Let’s be clear: granting mass amnesty to illegal migrants contradicts any Biden Administration claim that it is now somehow getting “tough” on the border […] Your failure of leadership and complete unwillingness to uphold the law continues to imperil the well-being and lives of American citizens,”

June 4, 2024
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
I write with alarm that your Department once again appears to be circumventing its duty to enforce immigration laws—this time by granting de facto amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants. According to recent reports, since 2022, the Biden Administration has closed the asylum cases of more than 350,000 migrants without a decision on the merits. These migrants are then no longer required to check in with authorities and can pursue other avenues to obtain legal status and remain in the country. Let’s be clear: granting mass amnesty to illegal migrants contradicts any Biden Administration claim that it is now somehow getting “tough” on the border. You must immediately reverse course and put an end to your covert mass amnesty program.
According to data gathered by Syracuse University’s Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), the Biden Administration has closed more than 350,000 asylum cases since the beginning of 2022, an unparalleled abuse compared to recent years. Individuals whose asylum cases are terminated are no longer tracked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and can pursue potential pathways to gain legal status. Effectively, you have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to remain in the United States indefinitely—for no other reason than the fact that their immigration case was not heard. In other words, you have created a mass de facto amnesty program that shields migrants from deportation.
This maneuver poses grave threats to the safety and security of the American people. The closed cases pertain to migrants who did not have a criminal record, but ICE officers have reported to news outlets an increase in cases of migrants committing crimes after their asylum cases have been closed. Just recently, reports indicated that a Venezuelan illegal alien accused of shooting of multiple New York Police Department officers had his immigration case closed in early May 2024. Migrant crime continues to be a major program in this country. Of course, Jose Ibarra, the alleged murderer of Laken Riley, was illegally paroled into the United States by the Biden Administration. Your failure of leadership and complete unwillingness to uphold the law continues to imperil the well-being and lives of American citizens.
The American people deserve answers about the Biden Administration’s attempts to create a mass amnesty program for illegal migrants. Please provide answers to the following questions by June 17, 2024:
W
hat, if anything, is your Department doing to track the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have had their asylum cases closed without a merits decision?
How
many migrants who have had their asylum cases closed have submitted applications for the following:
a.
Family-based visas
b.
Employment-based visas
c.
Temporary Protected Status
d.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
How
many of migrants who have had their asylum cases closed have then committed crimes in the United States? Please provide all responsive internal documents and break this data down by NCIC code.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

“While there is now a plan in place to fly Natalie and Davy’s remains back to Missouri, there are serious concerns about the security situation on the ground in Haiti over the next several days.

President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President,
Days ago, two Missouri missionaries, Natalie and Davy Lloyd, were brutally murdered by Haitian gangs as they were working to minister to the Haitian people. On the night they were besieged by gangs, my office urgently requested help from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. The Embassy informed us it was ‘too dangerous’ to send police to aid the Lloyds. Now they are dead. As I write, Natalie and Davy Lloyd’s remains are still not home and reunited with their families. Their government failed them in their hour of need. Now I ask that you take all available steps to ensure that adequate security measures are in place to safely return Natalie and Davy’s remains to the United States. I ask that you take action as expeditiously as possible.
While there is now a plan in place to fly Natalie and Davy’s remains back to Missouri, there are serious concerns about the security situation on the ground in Haiti over the next several days. Natalie and Davy’s bodies will need to be transported to the final point of departure, and until that time, there are major risks. The situation on the ground in Port-au-Prince remains anarchic. Haitian gangs are heavily armed and could delay or even hijack the vehicles carrying the Lloyds’ bodies. I must stress the critical importance of sufficient security personnel to protect the transport during the journey to the final point of departure.
Natalie and Davy devoted their lives to spreading the Gospel and serving others. As Missouri mourns their loss, I ask you to mobilize all resources at your disposal to protect the transport of the Lloyds’ remains back to Missouri. This is the least your government owes our citizens.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Rubio Blast McKinsey Lies, Push Firm to Dissolve Ties with China
Date: Wednesday, May 22, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sent a letter to Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, pressuring the company to dissolve its ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Senator Hawley has
introduced
legislation to prohibit federal agencies from working with consulting firms that hold a contract with the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party, or subsidiaries, affiliates, or proxies thereof. This bill—the
Time to Choose Act—
recently passed
the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) with strong bipartisan support. HSGAC Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Senator Rubio have joined the bill as co-sponsors.
“Your company’s inability to come clean about its dealings with the PRC disqualifies it from future work with the United States government,”
the Senators wrote. “We will continue to work to ensure McKinsey does not receive another dollar from the U.S. government until such time as the company owns up to its work on behalf of the Chinese government, severs all ties to the PRC, and commits to patriotic service on behalf of the United States of America.”
In February, Mr. Sternfels testified under oath that the company had no ties with China. Meanwhile, reporting revealed that the Urban China Initiative – a McKinsey-helmed project –released a book that directly contributed to China’s Made in China 2025 industrial plan, which accelerated Chinese trade abuses and the deterioration of U.S.-China relations.

or below.
May 21, 2024
Mr. Bob Sternfels
Global Management Partner
McKinsey & Company
555 California Street
Suite 4700
San Francisco, CA 94104
Dear Mr. Sternfels:
We write once again regarding McKinsey & Company’s work on behalf of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). You have stated, under oath, that “we do no work, and to the best of my knowledge never have, for the Chinese Communist Party or for the central government in China.” McKinsey spokespeople have stated on other occasions that the company’s client service policy forbids work in the PRC “on topics connected to defense, intelligence, justice or police issues.” Public reporting suggests these statements are false. At best, they are lawyerly evasions that fail to grapple with McKinsey’s role in supporting the most powerful adversary of the United States.
The Financial Times reported earlier this year that a McKinsey-led think tank, the Urban China Initiative, produced a report, which our offices possess, to inform the PRC’s 13th Five-Year Plan and “Made in China 2025” industrial strategy. The report, titled, The Trend and Impact of World Technological Revolution and Industrial Transformation, made scores of recommendations to enhance the military and industrial capabilities of the Chinese government. For example, the report urges the Chinese government to “vigorously promote” military-civil fusion, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy of absorbing commercial research and technology for military purposes. The report also contemplates how the PLA can deploy robots and autonomous systems to “improve the success rate of combat operations.” It also schemes about how the PRC can strengthen its national champions in advanced sensors to “eventually take control of the industry from foreign firms”—a takeover that is in progress today.
While the report was written in the staid language of management consulting, ultimately it was an attempt to help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dominate the United States and other countries in cutting-edge fields, including cloud computing, the internet of things, big data, mobile internet, robotics, 3D printing, advanced materials, self-driving vehicles, artificial intelligence, nonconventional oil and gas, electric vehicles, energy storage, renewable energy, and human genomic technology. The implications go beyond economic competition. The report notes that technologies such as these “will have a great impact on future wars and the development of the national defense industry.”
Of course, McKinsey claims that “[t]he Urban China Initiative is not McKinsey, and it did not perform work on McKinsey’s behalf.” Another evasion. McKinsey co-founded the Urban China Initiative. The think tank was based at the same address as McKinsey’s Beijing office. The Urban China Initiative website, which was hosted on a domain owned by McKinsey, directed press inquiries to McKinsey’s Beijing office. McKinsey’s top China hand, Lola Woetzel—who then went by the name “Jonathan”—wrote the foreword to the report. The foreword acknowledges that “McKinsey has compiled the relevant research data and added economic benefit indicators for quantitative screening” for the report. In fact, some passages detail examples in the United States which appear to mirror previous McKinsey reports. Woetzel also hand-delivered the report to the PRC’s second-highest-ranking official at the time, Premier Li Keqiang. McKinsey understandably wishes to disown the Urban China Initiative now that its work for the CCP has come to light, but one has to admit the offspring bears a strong resemblance to the parent.
Of course, the Urban China Initiative is not the only evidence of your firm’s assistance to the CCP. A few of the more notable pieces of evidence include:
McKinsey has performed work on behalf of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in the PRC, which are the industrial arms of the Chinese government and its representatives in overseas trade. The New York Times claims that McKinsey & Company has worked for “at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies” in the PRC. McKinsey & Company’s SOE clients reportedly include the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which has constructed military outposts for the PLA in the South China Sea, and the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), a key part of the PLA’s naval logistics.
McKinsey disclosed a commercial relationship with “the Chinese government” in a September 2020 court filing.
McKinsey’s official website for its PRC-related work, since scrubbed from the Internet, claimed that McKinsey has “served over 20 different central, provincial, and municipal government agencies on a wide range of economic planning, urban redevelopment, and social sector issues.”
The PRC and its propaganda organs have credited McKinsey for consulting on various initiatives.
McKinsey held a corporate retreat in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in 2018, where the government of the CCP is committing genocide against the Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.
Your company’s inability to come clean about its dealings with the PRC disqualifies it from future work with the United States government—a government your company has worked to undermine both economically and militarily at the behest of our nation’s primary geopolitical adversary.
We will continue to work to ensure McKinsey does not receive another dollar from the U.S. government until such time as the company owns up to its work on behalf of the Chinese government, severs all ties to the PRC, and commits to patriotic service on behalf of the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley                         Marco Rubio

Title: Hawley, Gillibrand Announce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Postal Workers from Rising Crime
Date: Monday, May 20, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)
introduced
the bipartisan
Protect Our Letter Carriers Act
to protect postal workers from an alarming uptick in
violent assaults
committed against them and modernize postal collection boxes to crack down on mail theft.
“Postal carriers work day in and day out to fulfill critical needs, like package deliveries, that Americans often take for granted. The recent uptick in violent assaults against these men and women is unacceptable and inexcusable. Congress should protect our postal workers on the job, and that starts by increasing enforcement of the law for crimes committed against them,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Amid a concerning uptick in postal crime, I’m proud to be introducing this critical bipartisan legislation to protect our mail and those who deliver it,”
said Senator Gillibrand.
“This bill will make long-overdue upgrades to mailboxes around the country to safeguard against the theft of Americans’ sensitive information. It will also strengthen penalties for assaulting a postal worker, helping ensure that the hard-working men and women who deliver our mail are not put in harm’s way because of their jobs. I look forward to getting this bill passed.”
The
Protect Our Letter Carriers Act
would:
Empower the Attorney General to vigorously prosecute any case of assault against a postal worker.
Direct the Attorney General to appoint an assistant U.S. attorney in each judiciary district to oversee the investigation and prosecution of alleged postal crimes.
Require the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend its guidelines, ensuring that the assault or robbery of a postal worker is prosecuted in the same manner as the assault or robbery of a law enforcement officer.
Authorize $7 billion over five years to install high security collection boxes and to replace older versions of the universal mailbox key with an electronic version.
Senator Hawley recently
pressed
the Postmaster General and United States Postal Service CEO for answers on a string of Missouri postal issues, including the
delayed rebuilding
of the Baring, Mo. Post Office and ongoing
mail and delivery delays
in the greater St. Louis, Mo. and Kansas City, Mo. regions.

Title: Hawley, Whitehouse Bill to Support Law Enforcement and Prevent Officer Suicides Passes Committee
Date: Thursday, May 16, 2024

Content:
Today a bill introduced by U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the
Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis (STOIC) Act, unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The bill provides grant funding for law enforcement family-support services and establishes suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers.
The senators first introduced the STOIC Act
in 2019, and it was
signed into law
later that year. Earlier this month,
they introduced a bill
to reauthorize the program before it expires. Passing committee is the first step toward securing reauthorization.
“There’s no better way to honor National Police Week than by having the backs of those who have ours,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The STOIC Act reaffirms our commitment to law enforcement at a time when they need support and life-saving resources more than ever. I’m grateful my colleagues have joined me and Senator Whitehouse in standing with our men and women in blue.”

Title: Hawley Fights to Defend Missouri Landowners From a Federal Takeover
Date: Wednesday, May 15, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary Granholm and
introduced new legislation
to block federal attempts to seize Missourians’ land.
The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA), led by Senate Democrats and signed by President Biden, gave the Department of Energy (DOE) authority to designate new transmission line corridors and seize land from Missouri landowners. Last week the DOE
announced the next stage
in this National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) process, proposing a corridor across Missouri. If implemented, this designation will allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve eminent domain for new transmission lines even when they have been previously denied by state regulators.
Senator Hawley
wrote
to DOE Secretary Granholm urging her to stop the implementation and protect Missouri landowners.
“This issue is important to farmers in my state, who have already had to deal with Invenergy’s attempts to build electric transmission lines through farmlands […] by designating a new NIETC in Missouri, you have chosen to federalize this issue and take any future consideration away from state regulators […] I strongly urge you to stop any further consideration of this project and listen to the farmers of Missouri,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
Following his letter, Senator Hawley introduced new legislation, the
Protecting Our Farmers from the Green New Deal Act
to repeal these provisions permanently and give back Missouri landowners’ rights to advocate for their property.
The
Protecting Our Farmers from the Green New Deal Act
would:
Prohibit FERC from issuing electrical siting permits where State regulators already have jurisdiction to authorize these projects.
Require FERC to find that any proposed electrical transmission projects it approves minimizes adverse effects on landowners and farmers, adequately compensates them for any loss, and provides benefits to consumers in the State.
Prohibit FERC from reviewing any electrical siting applications where a State regulator has previously denied an application.

Title: Hawley Bill Cracking Down on McKinsey, Management Consultants’ CCP Ties Passes Committee
Date: Wednesday, May 15, 2024

Content:
Today a bill introduced by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), the
Time to Choose Act,
passed
the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC).
The bill, which Senator Hawley
first put forth
in 2022, and
reintroduced earlier this year, prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms like McKinsey & Company who are also doing business with the Chinese government or its affiliates.
“American companies should be dedicated to advancing American interests, but firms like McKinsey are compromised—and our government is rewarding them,”
said Senator Hawley.
“My bill would require government contractors to choose between standing with the U.S. in its efforts to protect Americans against China’s imperial ambitions or standing with the CCP, and I’m glad the committee has advanced it.”
The
Time to Choose Act
would:
Prohibit federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms that hold a contract with certain foreign entities, including the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party.
Impose penalties on consulting firms that intentionally hide or misrepresent contracts with certain Chinese and other foreign entities, including:
Terminating affected federal contracts.
Debarring relevant firms from future work with the federal government.
Requiring relevant firms to pay damages equivalent to three times the amount spent by the U.S. government, pursuant to the
False Claims Act.

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill to Prohibit Taxpayer Dollars from Funding New Biden Admin Illegal Immigrant ID Program
Date: Tuesday, May 14, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Immigrant Identity Cards Act,
barring
President Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using taxpayers’ dollars to issue identity cards to illegal immigrants.
“Joe Biden opened the border and ushered in an era of unprecedented chaos in the U.S. And, now, rather than getting the crisis under control, he wants to use Americans’ money to fund ID cards for illegals,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Enough. Biden should be deporting illegal immigrants and securing our border—not giving them IDs and making it easier for them to take advantage of taxpayer benefits.”
Under a new DHS initiative set to
launch
this summer, the ICE Secure Docket Card Program is poised to provide thousands of illegal immigrants with “Secure Docket Cards” featuring a photograph and biographical information. These identity cards risk enabling illegal immigrants to exploit certain privileges and government benefits, such as housing, healthcare, or transportation—all at American taxpayers’ expense—while incentivizing more illegal immigration into the country.
The
No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Immigrant Identity Cards Act
would:
Restrict the DHS Secretary from using taxpayer funds to establish the ICE Secure Docket Card program or any other program that would provide taxpayer-funded identity cards to illegal immigrants.
Require the DHS Inspector General to report any costs associated with the ICE Secure Docket Card program or any other program that would provide taxpayer-funded identity cards to illegal immigrants.
Senator Hawley previously
raised
concerns over the Biden Administration’s carelessness concerning illegal immigrants’ use of identification forms in a 2022 letter to the Transportation Security Administration. He demanded answers about illegal aliens using arrest warrants and notices of deportation as valid identification to pass checkpoints and board commercial airplanes.

Title: Senators Hawley, Vance, and Rubio Urge Biden to Block U.S. Steel Sale to Foreign Company
Date: Friday, May 10, 2024

Content:
Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), JD Vance (R-Ohio), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sent a
letter
to President Biden calling on him to block Nippon Steel from acquiring U.S. Steel.
President Biden has repeatedly and publicly expressed his
support
for preventing a foreign takeover of one of America’s flagship companies. Nonetheless, Biden has refused to use his authority as president to block the deal.
“By law you possess the authority to block the sale of U.S. Steel unilaterally under the Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C. § 4565(d), or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a), when a national emergency is declared. You may exercise these powers now,”
the Senators wrote.
They continued, “Pronouncements about what you consider ‘vital’ or what you think ‘should’ happen to U.S. Steel are worthless unless you act to keep U.S. Steel under American control.”
Senator Hawley has been a leader on this issue. In December of last year, he sent a
letter
with Senators Vance and Rubio to Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury and Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), urging her to block the sale of U.S. Steel to the Japanese steel company.

May 9, 2024
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Biden:
We write to express our frustration with your public statements regarding the sale of U.S. Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”) to Nippon Steel Corporation (“Nippon”).
For weeks you have maintained that “it is vital for [U.S. Steel] to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.” You have since asserted that it “should remain an American company . . . American-owned and American-operated.” These statements amount to wishes, not declarations, and belie your authority as President of the United States.
By law you possess the authority to block the sale of U.S. Steel unilaterally under the Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C. § 4565(d), or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a), when a national emergency is declared. You may exercise these powers now. Pronouncements about what you consider “vital” or what you think “should” happen to U.S. Steel are worthless unless you act to keep U.S. Steel under American control.
Your predecessor displayed no such reticence. President Trump exercised his powers to suspend or prohibit foreign transactions unilaterally more than any other president. He forced divestitures to safeguard the American semiconductor industry and protect Americans’ data from firms linked to foreign adversaries. He has already declared that he would block the sale of U.S. Steel.
We urge you to summon the courage to do the right thing. Declare whether you will exercise your presidential authority to prohibit or suspend the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

expire
on June 7—compensates American victims whom the federal government has poisoned through its nuclear testing programs.
Senator Hawley specifically addressed Speaker Mike Johnson, urging him to send RECA to the House floor before it is too late:
“There’s only one month remaining before this vital program, this commitment that this nation has made to the working people of this nation, to the veterans of this nation, who have served this country, before this commitment runs out,”
said Senator Hawley.
“We have one month to go—and the House has not acted,”
he continued.

“The bill for this radiation has been paid. It’s been paid by the American people. . . . They’re the ones who are dying. They’re the ones who are having to forgo cancer treatments, treatments for their children . . . because their government has exposed them to this radiation negligently . . . It’s time the government bore its share,”
Senator Hawley concluded.

May 7, 2024
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
Across the country, campuses are in chaos. It is time for you to open an investigation into the reason why, and who’s funding it.
In university after university, antisemitic radicals have taken over entire buildings and large tracts of outdoor space. They are vandalizing property, blocking students from moving around their own campuses, and terrorizing Jewish students. All the while, many administrators have failed to take action to promote safety on campus.
Crucially, this is not just spontaneous student unrest. It is coordinated and funded by a powerful network of anti-Israel advocates. That is why, in October of last year, I sent you a letter seeking information on how many pro-terrorist student organizations—the groups calling for the effective destruction of Israel and justifying the massacre of Jewish people—received significant funding from third-party groups.
Now, we have answers—just not from your Department. Earlier this week, Politico detailed the vast amounts of dark money subsidizing this mayhem. Their report found that key groups backing the campus protests—like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow—received financial support from George Soros’s Tides Foundation. David Rockefeller’s Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Democratic megadonors Susan and Nick Pritzker were also cited in the report.
This pattern is disturbing. It is also almost certainly illegal. As IRS Revenue Ruling 75-384 established, no organization may retain its tax exemption if it backs protests at which members are urged to commit acts of civil disobedience. The IRS explained at length that illegal acts are “inconsistent with charitable ends,” and stressed that “[i]llegal activities, which violate the minimum standards of acceptable conduct necessary to the preservation of an orderly society, are contrary to the common good and the general welfare of the people in a community and thus are not permissible means of promoting the social welfare[.]” In short, by supporting illegal acts while enjoying tax-exempt status, dark-money groups and foundations are defrauding the American people and putting Jewish students and faculty at risk.
In order to properly inform our congressional oversight on this issue, you must immediately provide answers to the following questions:
1.) How many anti-Israel protests at American universities are currently receiving funding from third-party groups, and which groups are engaged in such support?
2.) What steps will you take to immediately enforce the requirements of IRS Revenue Ruling 75-384 against organized groups responsible for funding or otherwise sponsoring the ongoing campus lawbreaking?
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Warren File Bipartisan FAA Amendment to Protect Consumer Refunds from Airline Corporate Greed
Date: Thursday, May 02, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
filed
a bipartisan amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024 to ensure consumers’ right to an automatic refund if an airline cancels or significantly delays their flight.
“Passengers shouldn’t have to beg airlines for a refund when their flight gets delayed or is canceled altogether. This amendment would protect consumers and put Americans before airline profits,”
said Senator Hawley.
“When your flight gets delayed for hours or outright canceled, you shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to get your money back. Congress should come together to make this important change for automatic refunds and put American families ahead of airline profits,”
said Senator Warren.
Under a recently announced Department of Transportation
rule
set to take effect next month, airlines are mandated to refund passengers should their flight be canceled or significantly delayed. However, this year’s version of the FAA Reauthorization Act, which the Senate is currently negotiating, includes a provision that puts consumers last—stripping the automatic refund guarantee and forcing passengers to jump through endless bureaucratic hoops for reimbursements.
Senator Hawley’s bipartisan amendment would crack down on these burdensome corporate processes put in place to maximize airlines’ profits.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) in sending a bipartisan, bicameral
letter
to Speaker Mike Johnson, urging House leadership to immediately reauthorize and expand the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Reauthorization Act
(RECA) before compensation for radiation victims expires on June 7, 2024.
“Between 1945 and 1992, the U.S. conducted 206 above-ground nuclear weapons tests, dispersing radioactive material across vast swathes of the nation,”
wrote the lawmakers.
“The United States government exposed these Americans to radiation as part of our national security efforts through World War II and the Cold War. […] Their livelihoods, often devastated by the long-term consequences of radiation exposure, depend on your leadership and commitment to rectifying past injustices.

The Honorable Mike Johnson
Speaker
United State House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Hakeem Jefferies
Minority Leader
United State House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Speaker Johnson and Minority Leader Jefferies,
We are writing to urge you to immediately act to pass the Radiation Exposure Compensation Reauthorization Act, which was approved by the Senate on March 7, 2024 by a vote of 69-30. This critical legislation is critical to the communities and individuals historically marginalized and left suffering from the consequences of the United States’ nuclear testing program.
Between 1945 and 1992, the U.S. conducted 206 above-ground nuclear weapons tests, dispersing radioactive material across vast swathes of the nation. The landmark film Oppenheimer has brought renewed attention to these events, particularly highlighting the first nuclear explosion in New Mexico in 1945. The “downwinders,” along with those involved in uranium mining, milling, and transportation, are still enduring the health impacts from their exposure to this radiation. Initially established in 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) acknowledges these sacrifices by offering a one-time benefit to those afflicted with diseases due to their exposure to atomic testing and uranium industry work. Since its establishment, we have learned that far more communities were impacted by radiation exposure but were left out of the program. With RECA set to expire in June 2024, time is running out to ensure these individuals are not forgotten.
Although the Senate took a laudable step by passing an amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2024 to strengthen RECA, it was omitted in the final bill. Recently, the Senate passed a scaled down but nonetheless vital measure that proposes a five-year extension of the RECA program and expands compensation to downwinders in Western states, including New Mexico, and to post-1971uranium workers, alongside residents in Missouri, Kentucky, Alaska, and Tennessee who have suffered from exposure to improperly stored nuclear waste.
The action in the Senate to strengthen RECA was a meaningful step in seeking long overdue justice. But it is important that the scope of the RECA’s coverage be expanded to cover others who suffer the health consequences of the U.S.’s pursuit of national security to include regions in Pike and Scioto County, Ohio; Armstrong County, Pennsylvania; and communities near the Hanford site in Washington, where people have been adversely affected by the mishandling of nuclear waste. The residents in these areas deserve recognition and compensation for the health challenges they face due to government nuclear activity.
We urge to act immediately to strengthen the RECA program before its impending sunset in June 2024. The United States government exposed these Americans to radiation as part of our national security efforts through World War II and the Cold War. It is long past time that RECA is strengthened to give these Americans their recognition and compensation. Their livelihoods, often devastated by the long-term consequences of radiation exposure, depend on your leadership and commitment to rectifying past injustices. Let us honor the commitment we made to these citizens by ensuring they receive the support and recognition they so rightly deserve.
Thank you for your attention to this crucial matter.

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent
a letter to United States Postal Service (USPS) Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb Hull, urging an audit of all post offices and distribution centers in St. Louis County, St. Charles County, and St. Louis City as Missourians continue to experience consistent mail and delivery delays.
“Recently, a growing number of Missouri residents from the St. Louis area have contacted my office, citing insufficient mail delivery services. For some constituents, the result has been routine delivery delays, while others have not received deliveries at all,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“One resident in the St. Louis area said she had not received her mail in more than three months, resulting in late bills and financial harm to her small business operations. Others have described losing access to their prescription medications and Social Security checks.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
pressed
Postmaster General and USPS CEO Louis DeJoy for an update on the ongoing postal delays in St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. and questioned him on his plan to address the problems.

The Honorable Tammy Whitcomb Hull
Inspector General
United States Postal Service
1735 N. Lynn Street
Arlington, Virginia, 22209-2020
Dear Inspector General Hull,
I write to express my concern about continued mail delays from the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the St. Louis area. To help address these ongoing problems, I urge you to audit all post offices and distribution centers in St. Louis County, St. Charles County, and St. Louis City.
Recently, a growing number of Missouri residents from the St. Louis area have contacted my office, citing insufficient mail delivery services. For some constituents, the result has been routine delivery delays, while others have not received deliveries at all.  One resident in the St. Louis area said she had not received her mail in more than three months, resulting in late bills and financial harm to her small business operations. Others have described losing access to their prescription medications and Social Security checks.
It is critical that Missourians receive their mail in a timely manner. To assess the root causes of these delays and ensure they are appropriately addressed, I respectfully request that you investigate the service complaints from St. Louis County, St. Charles County, and the City of St. Louis, and conduct an audit of the offices in those localities.
Please reply to my office by May 13, 2024, to detail your plans and expected timeline to complete this audit of the St. Louis region’s post offices.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Biden Use National Guard to Protect Jewish Students Amid Pro-Hamas Campus Protests
Date: Tuesday, April 23, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to President Biden calling on him to
mobilize the National Guard
to protect Jewish American students in response to anti-Israel, pro-terrorist demonstrations that have broken out on college campuses.
“On college campuses across the United States, Jewish Americans are at risk […] In your statement on Passover, you stated that ‘in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant Antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.’ Now, you must take action to match those words,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “You must immediately mobilize the National Guard and any other authorities necessary to ensure the safety of Jewish American students and citizens.”
Last October, the Senate unanimously
passed
Senator Hawley’s resolution condemning Hamas and the antisemitic rhetoric emanating from campus student groups, which have continued to celebrate the Oct. 7 terrorist attack against Israel. The passage of Senator Hawley’s resolution came after Democrats initially
blocked
the measure.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
April 22, 2024
President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Mr. President:
On college campuses across the United States, Jewish Americans are at risk. Most alarmingly, in-person classes at Columbia University have been cancelled today—on the Jewish holiday of Passover—in response to a dayslong, illegal pro-Hamas demonstration. You must immediately mobilize the National Guard and any other authorities necessary to ensure the safety of Jewish American students and citizens.
Over the past several days, a coordinated, anti-Israel action has erupted at Columbia. Demonstrators have illegally established a “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” on the university’s campus and engaged in shocking displays of antisemitism—assaults on Jewish students, the theft and attempted burning of an Israeli flag, and violent, genocidal rhetoric such as “Never forget the 7th of October. That will happen not 1 more time, not 5 more times, not 10 more times, not 100 more times, not 1,000 more times, but 10,000 times.”
Campus police and local law enforcement have failed to secure the campus. On Sunday, Rabbi Elie Buechler, the Director of the university’s Orthodox Union-Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, stated that these authorities “cannot guarantee Jewish students’ safety” and recommended that Jewish students “return home as soon as possible.” And today, on Passover, Columbia University President Minouche Shafik cancelled in-person classes, citing “too many examples of intimidating and harassing behavior on our campus.”
In your statement on Passover, you stated that “in recent days, we’ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant Antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.” Now, you must take action to match those words.
In 1957, pursuant to Executive Order 10730, President Dwight Eisenhower deployed the National Guard and 101st Airborne Division to ensure the safety of black students attending Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas. I urge you to similarly mobilize the National Guard and other necessary authorities to protect Jewish American students on Columbia University’s campus, and any other campus where Jewish students are at risk. “Never again” means never again.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces Amendment to Halt Expansion of FBI’s Surveillance Authority into Americans’ Lives
Date: Friday, April 19, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
released
the following statements, warning against a new power grab by the FBI through Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) section 702 reauthorization—which the House of Representatives has already passed and the Senate is currently negotiating. Senator Hawley
announced
the introduction of an amendment to protect Americans from this further government overreach.
Senator Hawley has repeatedly
condemned
the FBI for abusing its authority to surveil Americans and colluding with Big Tech to harvest Americans’ data.
On FISA: Everyone should know about the Turner Amendment.
This part of the House bill gives the FBI the power to press even MORE individuals into helping facilitate government surveillance.
Could your landlord or your handyman be sharing your info with the FBI? Maybe.
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
April 18, 2024
And who are we giving more power to by making FISA broader? The FBI. An agency that has repeatedly proven they don’t deserve it.
Remember the Durham report? It found the FBI abused their power to open an investigation into the Trump campaign.
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
April 18, 2024
And the FBI’s record on Section 702 is just as bad. In 2022, a judge identified around 278,000 improper searches on Americans in the FISA database.⁰
This is the same FBI the House decided to give even MORE power too. It’s insane. And it must be stopped.
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
April 18, 2024
Bottom line: the government doesn’t deserve more open-ended surveillance authority. I’ve introduced an amendment to stop this new power grab before it’s too late.

Title: Hawley Condemns Pending Release of Dangerous Criminal Robert Courtney
Date: Thursday, April 18, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Colette Peters opposing the pending release of Robert Courtney. Courtney was sentenced to thirty years in federal prison after diluting tens of thousands of prescription medications for his own profit. Courtney
is scheduled
for transfer to a halfway house in June, before his sentence is completed.
“Courtney’s greed led him to dilute 98,000 prescriptions, placing countless vulnerable Missourians at risk and sparking hundreds of wrongful death lawsuits […] The protection of the public must always be the Bureau’s primary duty. Releasing Courtney early, even if only to a halfway house, is an abdication of that duty,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
In 2020, Senator Hawley
called for
Courtney to serve his entire sentence in prison when he was set to be released early due to COVID protocols.
Read the full letter

April 18, 2024
Colette Peters
Director
Federal Bureau of Prisons
320 1st Street NW
Washington, DC 20534
Dear Director Peters:
I write to express my strong opposition to the Bureau’s decision to release Kansas City pharmacist Robert Courtney, who diluted thousands of medication prescriptions for thousands of Missouri patients.
Courtney’s greed led him to dilute 98,000 prescriptions, placing countless vulnerable Missourians at risk and sparking hundreds of wrongful death lawsuits. Mr. Courtney is unarguably a danger to the public and should serve out the entirety of his 30-year prison term.
The protection of the public must always be the Bureau’s primary duty. Releasing Courtney early, even if only to a halfway house, is an abdication of that duty. For the safety and security of law-abiding Missourians, I urge you to reconsider the decision to begin releasing Mr. Courtney before his sentence is fully served.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: ‘Is this a Record that You are Proud of?’: Hawley Lambasts Mayorkas for Americans Killed by Illegal Immigrants
Date: Thursday, April 18, 2024

Content:
Today in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
questioned
Department of Homeland Security DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, condemning him for repeatedly lying to Congress and willfully implementing President Biden’s open-border policies that have caused growing numbers of Americans to die at the hands of illegal immigrants.
“You have lied repeatedly to Congress and to the American people about [Ibarra’s criminal history]. . . . I just want to know, why did you change your story so often?”
asked Senator Hawley. . . . “Well, hopefully [Ibarra] will get more of a trial than you got. Otherwise, they’ll be no justice for anyone at all.”
Senator Hawley specifically chronicled the crimes of illegal immigrants Jose Ibarra, who allegedly murdered 22-year-old Laken Riley of Georgia, and Endrina Bracho, who allegedly killed 12-year-old Travis Wolfe of Missouri.
“This is your policy in action, Mr. Secretary: A criminal is permitted into this country on grounds . . . flatly contradictory to the statute. [Ibarra] commits a crime against a child, and then he gets a work permit,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley closed by again urging Secretary Mayorkas to resign.
“Mr. Secretary, I know that you think your policies are a success. . . . Maybe they’re working for your political objectives . . . but they’re not working for Laken Riley or Travis Wolfe or the people of my state. . . . What you have done is a travesty, and, sir, it is long past time for you to go,”
concluded Senator Hawley.

Title: ‘This is Hell’: Boeing Whistleblower Tells Hawley Planes Aren’t Safe & He’s Being Targeted by Execs

Today in a Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee Hearing on Investigations, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
questioned
Boeing’s current Quality Engineer Sam Salehpour on the alarming safety concerns surrounding the aviation company’s planes. Salehpour outlined Boeing’s repeated retaliatory behavior against him for blowing the whistle on safety concerns and internal engineering problems with the 787 and 777 aircraft.
“It is unbelievable to me, that in the midst of this safety crisis at this corporation, that what they’re doing is threatening their own engineers whose job it is to help identify potential safety concerns,”
said Senator Hawley.
“And, rather than saying, . . . we need to maybe do something about this, they’re telling you to hide it; they’re reassigning you; they’re threatening you; they’re trying to shut you up.”
[ . . . ]
“You just try to escape from that because this is hell that I was subjected to, and then [Boeing] threatens you,”
Salehpour admitted.
Senator Hawley continued his line of questioning, noting the windfalls Boeing executives are earning while endangering the public and manipulating its employees.
“In the meantime, I noticed this guy Dave Calhoun . . . He’s the CEO. I guess he’s leaving at the end of the year. I wonder how much he’s getting paid. I bet it’s a lot,”

destroyed
in 2023. Senator Hawley also asked for an update on the ongoing postal delays in Kansas City and St. Louis, Mo.
In regard to the Post Office in Baring, Mo.,
Senator Hawley said, “this is a rural community in my state, and they don’t have a post office at all. What bothers me is I haven’t heard anything about the timeline for getting it rebuilt […] I’m frustrated by the fact that it has been months and months, and I was told ninety days in September, and this is now the middle of April, and here we are.”
Mr. DeJoy did not provide an update on the timeline for the rebuild, but committed to Senator Hawley that he would get him one.
Regarding the ongoing postal delays in Kansas City, Mo.
Senator Hawley said, “We have seen a tripling of casework reports in Kansas City, folks who are just saying they’re just not getting their mail […] This is happening in Kansas City, and frankly in St. Louis on the other side of the state as well.”
Senator Hawley then asked for an update on the implementation of the Inspector General’s recommendations on the delayed mail process.
Mr. DeJoy explained that contracting issues resulted in the delays, but claimed that the issue should slowly be resolved and conditions improved.

Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who serves as Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)
wrote
a letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group (UHG) following its disastrous data breach by ransomware group BlackCat in February.
The senators seek answers as to “how its critical health care systems were breached, why the firm suffered such an egregious and unexplained outage, and whether patient and provider data was compromised in the attack.” The letter goes on to demand that UHG proactively advance payments for all claims – not just UHG claims – to providers and asks what steps the group has taken to ensure such a breach never occurs again.
“The result of UHG’s failure to properly safeguard against cyber threats and the subsequent, extended outage of its services has been dire. Providers were unable to fill prescriptions, verify patients’ eligibility for treatment, and submit insurance claims. Over three weeks later, the outage is not completely resolved,”
the letter continues.

here
or below.
April 1, 2024
Andrew Witty
Chief Executive Officer
UnitedHealth Group
UnitedHealth Group Center
990 Bren Road East
Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343
Dear Mr. Witty,
We write demanding information regarding the disastrous disruption of UnitedHealth Group’s (“UHG”) subsidiary Change Healthcare (“Change”) by the ransomware group BlackCat, and seek answers about how its critical health care systems were breached, why the firm has suffered such an egregious and unexplained outage, and whether patient and provider data was compromised in the attack. Further, and importantly, we demand that UHG proactively advance payments for all claims – not just UHG claims – to providers so they can keep their doors open as you resolve this inexcusably lengthy shutdown of your systems.
While we recognize that UHG was indeed the victim of an outside attack, the entire sector is now the victim of UHG’s lack of preparedness and built in redundancies, which could have potentially mitigated the widespread impact of the breach. The lessons from this cyber- attack and UHG’s response to it have significant implications for the readiness and resiliency of the entire healthcare and public health sector – which is why UHG’s transparency is of the utmost importance.
On February 21st, Change suffered a catastrophic cyberattack that took down its entire infrastructure, and left the American health care system “paralyzed.” Change had become “critical infrastructure” to the American health care system, processing 15 billion health care transactions and $1.5 trillion in healthcare claims annually. Because of the company’s overwhelming reach—handling as many as one of every three patient records in the country— the breach of Change was tantamount to targeting the health care system in its entirety.
The result of UHG’s failure to properly safeguard against cyber threats and the subsequent, extended outage of its services has been dire. Providers were unable to fill prescriptions, verify patients’ eligibility for treatment, and submit insurance claims. Over three weeks later, the outage is not completely resolved. Patients, whose illnesses cannot be put on hold for UHG’s failures, face uncertainty in accessing treatment and the prospect that their Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI)—extremely private information—is now in the hands of criminals.
The disruption has also led to alarming downstream risks for the financial stability of the health care sector, especially for rural and small providers. With its systems still offline, the company is paying out far fewer insurance claims than usual. Even as providers and practices verge on bankruptcy, UHG has not meaningfully cleaned up the damage. When providers have turned to the emergency lending program held out by UnitedHealth, they have received pitiful offers as low as $10.
Even when providers receive loans, the terms and conditions have been described as “shockingly onerous.” UHG has allegedly modified its financial assistance program to provide more generous advance payments, announcing that $2 billion in fund have been advanced only after your initial loan program was harshly criticized, but providers are still struggling financially: in Connecticut, as of this writing, our providers report that they have yet to receive meaningful assistance from your company. Without a useable bridge program for providers, UHG’s delayed efforts can be seen as little more than a public relations strategy to placate stockholders and win over public opinion.
The origin of this crisis can be traced back to 2021, when UHG moved to buy Change Healthcare. At the time, UHG’s subsidiary Optum was one of Change’s primary competitors in the health care IT space. Medical trade groups warned that the merger would not only result in a near-monopoly in health IT, but also give UnitedHealth Care—the country’s largest insurer and a subsidiary of UHG—access to competitors’ claims and policy information. The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued unsuccessfully to block the deal, and the merger was allowed to proceed.
UnitedHealth and Change became too big to fail, and then they did—disastrously. Accountability needs to fall on the companies responsible for the chaos. We ask for your responses to the following questions by April 15, 2024:
1. How did the hackers behind the Change cyberattack initially breach the company and gain such significant access to its systems?
2. Please provide a detailed timeline of all events related to the breach, including the date and background on the discovery, response, and remediation of compromised systems or disabled services.
3. According a claim from an affiliate of the BlackCat group, up to four terabytes of data were stolen in the hack, including Medicare and insurance data. What data, including provider or patient data, was compromised in the attack?
a. What, if any, processes have Change Healthcare and UnitedHealthGroup used to identify compromised provider or patient data?
b. Have Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth Group notified impacted providers or patients regarding their compromised data?
4. Why has it taken so much time for the Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems to recover from the attack, and why did Change not have sufficient redundancy to prevent an outage? Please describe Change’s plans to respond to potential cyberattacks and why those plans appear to have failed.
5. What, if any, cybersecurity improvements have Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth Group made since the attack?
a. What assurances do providers and patients have that Change’s infrastructure is secure against further breaches or disruptions?
6. Reporting indicates the BlackCat was paid $22 million in bitcoin in early March, and that the ransomware group may have stolen those funds from the affiliated hacker in possession of Change’s data.
a. Did Change Healthcare or UnitedHealth Group, or anyone acting on their behalf, make a ransomware payment, and if so for what purposes?
b. What steps have BlackCat or its affiliates taken in response to the payment of a ransom, and does Change have any reliable assurances that provider or patient data has been deleted or will not be shared?
7. Regarding UnitedHealth Group’s financial assistance program:
a. Has UnitedHealth Group proactively contacted any health care providers regarding cash assistance? If so, how have you contacted them? If not, why not?
b. Please describe the application process to request funds.
c. Please describe any terms and conditions providers are required to agree to in order to access advance payments.
8. On March 7, 2024, you announced a switch from a loan program, which was heavily criticized by providers, to an advance payment program.
a. Why didn’t UHG immediately begin create an advance payment program once it was clear an extended shutdown of Change was likely?
b. Why did you instead opt for a loan program with “onerous” conditions?
9. On March 18, 2024, you announced your company “has advanced more than $2 billion thus far through multiple initiatives.”
a. What percentage of providers serviced by Change have received an advance payment from UnitedHealth Group?
b. What has been the average payment?
c. On average, what percentage of the revenue gap providers are experiencing has UHG filled? Please provide percentages for UHG-only claims and claims for all payers.
10. UnitedHealth Group’s financial assistance program is intended to cover UnitedHealthcare claims, but obviously, UnitedHealthcare claims only make up a fraction of providers’ revenue. UnitedHealth Group has announced a program “of last resort” for providers “who work with a payer who has opted not to advance funds to providers.” Whether or not UHG advances payments for other payers’ claims will be determined on a “case-by-case basis.”
a. Considering this problem stems directly and solely from Change’s nearly month-long shutdown, why is UnitedHealth Group relying on other payers to fill the cash flow gap? How many providers have requested UnitedHealth Group advance payments on behalf of other payers, and how many of those requests have been honored?
11. Has UnitedHealth taken steps or discussed acquiring any practice or provider impacted by the Change attack? If so, please name what entities and provide information about this attempted acquisition.
12. Reporting indicates that UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum has attempted to accelerate its purchase of at least one medical practice that faced bankruptcy if it did not receive an immediate cash infusion, while avoiding patient protections and other conditions on the purchase sought by the state health authority, under the guise of the emergency it created. UnitedHealth’s attempts to “profit[] from the desperation” created by its own failures are unconscionable.
a. Has UnitedHealth agreed to the conditions sought by the Oregon Health Authority in connection with its purchase of The Corvallis Clinic?
b. Has Optum made new offers to purchase any practices since the February 21st attack? If so, how many?
i. How many of the target practices faced financial consequences resulting from the February 21st attack?
ii. How many of these practices were in negotiations with Optum prior to the attack?
c. Have other UnitedHealth subsidiaries attempted to “profit[ ] from the desperation” by making advantageous deals or other business arrangements with companies facing financial hardship as a result of the February 21st attack?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Senator Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Calls on DOJ to Investigate FICO for Anticompetitive Practices
Date: Tuesday, March 12, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter urging the Department of Justice to investigate The Fair Isaac Corporation’s (FICO) potentially anticompetitive practices.
“The credit score market is dominated by FICO, a for-profit company operated under a sweetheart deal from the federal government,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Because of this government-granted monopoly, FICO enjoys a 90 percent market share in the business-to-business credit scoring market. It is the only real competitor in the space.”
“In an apparent abuse of this market power, FICO has astronomically hiked its prices,”
he continued. “These cost increases will be borne by homebuyers who are already facing the worst housing market in this country’s history. […] This is, in short, a company abusing its market power to pad its bottom line and make life worse for Americans. It is time for the Antitrust Division to step in and investigate.”

Jonathan Kanter
Assistant Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division
Main Justice Building, Room 1137
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter:
The Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) appears to be using its monopolistic power over the credit scoring market to increase costs for mortgage lenders—an increase that will be passed on to consumers. FICO’s recent actions demand that you investigate the company for these anticompetitive practices.
The credit score market is dominated by FICO, a for-profit company operated under a sweetheart deal from the federal government. FICO’s credit scores are required for loans originated with government entities such as the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs. This means that most home buyers are forced to obtain their mortgage from a lender who uses FICO’s services. Because of this government-granted monopoly, FICO enjoys a 90% market share in the business-to-business credit scoring market. It is the only real competitor in the space.
In an apparent abuse of this market power, FICO has astronomically hiked its prices. For 2024, FICO is once again increasing the price to access its scores, including both “hard” and “soft” pulls. It did the same thing last year, bumping prices as much as 400%. In total, FICO’s actions over the last two years have increased the cost of its credit scores by 500%. During the same period, FICO’s stock price has more than doubled.
These cost increases will be borne by homebuyers who are already facing the worst housing market in this country’s history. FICO’s price increases will lead to either higher upfront costs or higher interest rates for borrowers, especially lower-income borrowers who may take longer to purchase a home. This is, in short, a company abusing its market power to pad its bottom line and make life worse for Americans. It is time for the Antitrust Division to step in and investigate. The last thing this country needs is another company distorting the housing market in the name of corporate profits.
Accordingly, I urge you to investigate FICO’s potentially anticompetitive practices at the earliest opportunity.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senate Passes Hawley Legislation to Compensate Victims of Government Radiation with Strong Bipartisan Support
Date: Thursday, March 07, 2024

Content:
Today the U.S. Senate
passed
Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) legislation to reauthorize and expand the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA), by a vote of 69-30.
“This isn’t about a handout. This isn’t about some kind of welfare program. This is about doing basic justice by the working people of this nation, whom their own government has poisoned. This is the day when we break the cycle of lies from the government, when we break the cycle of passing the buck and irresponsibility from the government,”
said Senator Hawley.
Click
here
or on the image above to watch the full remarks.
Senator Hawley’s legislation would reauthorize RECA—which is set to expire this spring—and finally compensate victims of radioactive waste in impacted areas across the country, including the St. Louis, Mo., and St. Charles, Mo., region. Without this critical funding, victims of government-caused radiation will be denied the compensation they need to treat diseases and cancers caused by their federal government’s nuclear waste.
Senators Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Eric Schmidt (R-Mo.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) are co-sponsors of this legislation.
Background
Senator Hawley has been the leading voice in the fight to secure just compensation for radiation victims in
Missouri
—and across the nation.
On Tuesday, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) General Scott Spellmon and Colonel Andy Pannier, blasting the Corps for its deliberate concealment of cleanup efforts in the St. Louis area after new disturbing reports detail more radioactive contamination in residents’ homes.
On Monday, Senator Hawley
announced
he will bring Dawn Chapman—co-founder of the grassroots advocacy group “Just Moms” in St. Louis and longtime advocate for victims of nuclear contamination in the region—as his guest to tonight’s State of the Union address.
Last week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to his Republican colleagues in the Senate, urging them to reauthorize RECA.
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
delivered
remarks on the Senate floor, blasting Senate leadership for continuing to ignore Americans who have been poisoned by the federal government and instead shoveling money to foreign wars.

from the NDAA by
congressional leadership.
Senator Hawley has committed to doing whatever it takes to reauthorize this vital legislation and bring justice to victims of government-caused nuclear radiation.

Title: Hawley Lifts Holds on FTC & NTSB Nominees
Date: Thursday, March 07, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statements, announcing his lift of holds on the nominations of Andrew Ferguson to be a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Todd Inman, who is under consideration for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Senator Hawley previously
sent a letter
to U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) this past December, citing concerns about Ferguson and Inman—two of the Senate Minority Leader’s nominees—over their policy views on several issues, including Big Tech and rail safety.
Regarding Ferguson’s nomination, Senator Hawley said,
“I have now had the chance to speak with Andrew Ferguson, nominated for the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. Ferguson answered a series of questions from me in writing and also spoke with me in person at length. I was pleased to hear him express strong support for robust antitrust enforcement. He particularly emphasized the dangers of concentration in the healthcare sector and how this concentration harms rural healthcare, drives up consumer prices, and degrades quality of care. He pledged to be a firm advocate for prioritizing working people and their rights over corporate interests and monopolies,”
He continued, “
I appreciate Mr. Fergusons commitment to this process and his responsiveness to my concerns. Based on his responses to me, I am pleased to support his nomination.”
Regarding Inman’s nomination, Senator Hawley said, “I have now had the chance to speak directly and at length with Todd Inman, nominated for the National Transportation Safety Board. I have also reviewed his answers to my written questions. I appreciated his thoroughness both in our personal conversation and in his written answers. Mr. Inman repeatedly told me he would be a strong, independent voice for Americans’ safety at the NTSB, beholden to no person or interest. Mr. Inman pledged to work tirelessly for rail safety, and told me he was “encouraged” by our recent efforts to pass a railroad safety bill in the Senate. He pledged to support the full and swift implementation of the duck boat vehicle regulations as adopted by Congress, pursuant to my legislation. He also pledged to work to implement the additional NTSB recommendations on duck boats from 2018,”
“I appreciate Mr. Inman’s commitment to this process and his willingness to see it through. Having completed the process, I am pleased to support his nomination,”
he concluded.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Call Out Biden State Dept After Failing to Address Nigeria’s Religious Freedom Violations: ‘You have again failed to meet the moment’
Date: Wednesday, March 06, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
penned a letter
to Secretary of State Antony Blinken regarding the State Department’s ongoing refusal to re-designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC). The letter points to the horrific massacre of Nigerian Christians this past Christmas season as a recent example of violence targeting Christians and expresses concerns about the deteriorating state of religious freedom in Nigeria.
U.S. Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also signed the letter.
“As you know, violence against Christians in Nigeria runs rampant. Reports estimate that roughly 5,000 Nigerian Christians have been murdered in religiously-motivated violence in each of the last two years. We wrote to you last on June 29, 2022, following the murders of at least 50 Nigerian churchgoers and the mob stoning of a Christian college student in Nigeria. But this letter was met with a total lack of action by your Department,”
the Senators wrote.
“Apparently, your Department believes these repeated, violent attacks against Christians can be attributed to climate change. That is absurd.”
They continued,
“You must not stand idly by while Nigerian Christians continue to be murdered for their faith. We urge you to immediately use the tools at your disposal and re-designate Nigeria as a CPC. We will continue to conduct oversight and hold the Biden Administration accountable until you fulfill your obligation under the law.”
Senator Hawley has
previously
pressed
Blinken on religious freedom violations in Nigeria and the State Department’s failure to act.

March 6, 2024
The Honorable Antony Blinken
Secretary of State
United States Department of State
2201 C St NW
Washington, D.C. 20520
Secretary Blinken:
We write to you once again with deep disappointment over the State Department’s refusal to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC). The horrific slaughter of Nigerian Christians around Christmas Day should have spurred you to action, but you have again failed to meet the moment. We remain very concerned about the deteriorating state of religious freedom in Nigeria and your Department’s continued failure to appropriately respond using the tools at your disposal.
During a Christmas season that should have been abundant with joy and peace, Christians in several Nigerian farming villages faced one of the deadliest massacres in the country’s recent history. From December 23 to December 25, 2023, Islamic extremists murdered at least 140 people, including women and children, with an untold number wounded and displaced as a result of this senseless violence. It was a targeted attack carried out with shocking brutality.
As you know, violence against Christians in Nigeria runs rampant. Reports estimate that roughly 5,000 Nigerian Christians have been murdered in religiously-motivated violence in each of the last two years. We wrote to you last on June 29, 2022, following the murders of at least 50 Nigerian churchgoers and the mob stoning of a Christian college student in Nigeria. But this letter was met with a total lack of action by your Department. Apparently, your Department believes these repeated, violent attacks against Christians can be attributed to climate change. That is absurd.
Nigeria continues to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for Christians. Since the Biden Administration de-listed Nigeria as a CPC in 2021, religious freedom protections have eroded under the Nigerian government. Yet the State Department again refused to re-designate Nigeria as a CPC last month—contrary to the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and numerous religious freedom and human rights organizations.
You must not stand idly by while Nigerian Christians continue to be murdered for their faith. We urge you to immediately use the tools at your disposal and re-designate Nigeria as a CPC. We will continue to conduct oversight and hold the Biden Administration accountable until you fulfill your obligation under the law.

Title: Senate Committee Passes Hawley, Booker Bipartisan Legislation to Crack Down on Child Labor, Hold Companies Accountable for Violations
Date: Wednesday, March 06, 2024

Content:
Today the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
passed
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Cory Booker’s (D-N.J.) bipartisan
Preventing Child Labor Exploitation in Federal Contracting Act
to prohibit companies that engage in illegal child labor practices from securing coveted federal government contracts.
“Companies that illegally employ children have no business leveraging lucrative federal government contracts for corporate gain. This bipartisan legislation would hold companies’ feet to the fire for engaging in child labor exploitation and rightfully hold offenders accountable,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
Preventing Child Labor Exploitation in Federal Contracting Act
would:
Require companies entering into federal contracts to annually represent, and certify when bidding on a contract, that they have not been found in violation of the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
Prohibit federal agencies from awarding federal government contracts to violating companies that have failed to complete corrective measures. Companies would remain ineligible for federal contracts for a period of at least four years.
Render stiff penalties for failure to make required representations or certifications of child labor violations.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last October, Senator Hawley
questioned
Robin Dunn Marcos, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, about the
85,000 children
the Biden Administration has lost track of, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers and dangerous child labor practices. Senator Hawley also sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding a full-scale effort be made to locate the nearly 85,000 missing migrant children.
In September of 2023, Senator Hawley

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Stop Chinese EVs Before They Destroy Our Auto Industry
Date: Tuesday, March 05, 2024

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | March 5, 2024 |
Fox News
Last year, President Biden announced sweeping new mandates on the American auto industry to force a transition to electric vehicles. Under these radical, Green New Deal rules, as many as two-thirds of all cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market by 2032 would have to be EVs.
These rules were so terrible for consumers – and met with such fierce resistance by American workers – that his administration is already second-guessing them.
Biden has the wrong target. And his commitment to climate radicalism threatens to decimate an industry that has been the foundation of the American middle class for a century.
Rather than strangle our auto sector with regulations, he should focus instead on protecting them from Chinese automakers – the very ones that are dumping vehicles on the global market, and setting their sights on the United States.
[…]
China has emerged as a dominant automaker in recent years, surpassing Japan as the world’s largest auto exporter in 2023. China’s dominance is not by accident. The Chinese Communist Party has deployed hundreds of billions of industrial subsidies, stolen intellectual property, and imposed forced technology transfers to get ahead.
It’s worked: China now holds a commanding share of the global market for autos, especially EVs and their component parts.
That’s why Biden has it entirely backwards. His EV mandates threaten to undermine U.S. automakers and make the industry even more dependent on components from China. That’s an outcome American workers cannot afford.
[…]
That’s why I am introducing tough, new legislation to stop the avalanche of Chinese EVs. My bill would impose a new 100% tariff on all vehicles from China, increasing the total tariff on these cars to 125%.
It would also close this “Mexico loophole” by establishing a new rule of origin to block Chinese automakers from circumventing tariffs by building their cars in third countries. This will go a long way to stopping the flood of EVs in the U.S. market before it starts.
[…]
The solution is simple. If he really wants to protect American workers, Joe Biden must immediately hike tariffs on Chinese autos – rather than doubling down on Green New Deal mandates.

Title: Hawley Introduces New Bill to Raise Tariffs on China’s Green Energy Sector, Protect American Energy Independence
Date: Tuesday, March 05, 2024

Content:
Today
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R Mo.)
introduced
the
Declaring Our Energy Independence From China Act
to counter the Biden Administration’s energy surrender to America’s greatest adversary. This new legislation would raise tariffs on China’s green-energy goods to prioritize and protect U.S. energy independence.
“President Biden’s climate agenda undermines U.S. energy independence and will make us more reliant on China,”
said Senator Hawley.
“We can’t afford energy policies that enrich our greatest adversary at the expense of American workers here at home. It’s time to declare our energy independence from China—and we can start by raising tariffs on China’s green energy sector.”
Last week, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
Protecting American Autoworkers from China Act, new legislation that would counter the threat posed to the U.S. auto industry by raising tariffs on autos imported from China and closing the backdoor Chinese automakers use to evade U.S. trade laws.
In May of 2023, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
Raising Tariffs on Imports from China Act
which would require the President to impose an additional tariff of 25 percent on all goods imported from China if a bilateral deficit is recorded during the preceding calendar year.
Senator Hawley’s
Declaring Our Energy Independence From China Act
will:
Require the President to apply additional tariffs to all battery components, solar energy components, and wind energy components imported from China at a 25 percent rate.
Require the President to increase the 25 percent rate by an additional five percent each of the following five years, for a final rate of 50 percent.
Require the United States Trade Representative to submit to Congress a report detailing the extent to which China has, during the preceding 15 years, provided industrial subsidies to its battery, solar energy, and wind energy sectors.

Colonel, U.S. Army
1222 Spruce Street
St. Louis, MO 63103-2833
General Spellmon and Colonel Pannier,
Decades of radioactive contamination have devastated the Coldwater Creek region of St. Louis. And this week witnessed yet another nightmare scenario: your disclosure that this contamination may extend
beneath residents’ homes. Residents are rightly horrified by the possibility that their homes are built atop radioactive waste—waste which should never have been there in the first place. USACE assumed jurisdiction of the area in 1997. Why has it taken so long for you to disclose this risk?
Your latest confirmation of new sampling activities in a subdivision with an “old creek meander” that was “covered up with fill” is alarming. Your office now says the contamination is buried deep enough it may not been a problem. That is no answer. We have no idea about the true extent of the risk, not least because you have refused for years to undertake needed testing in and around homes.
Until now, USACE has confined its testing to the historic 10-year floodplain around Coldwater Creek. I have repeatedly raised concerns that this testing plan is too narrow. Now we have confirmation. More comprehensive testing and remediation is obviously merited and immediately necessary. You must begin your new investigations without delay—and you must tell members of the community about anything else you’ve kept from public view.
As for clean up, you have stated that remediation activities will take place within a year. That is far too long a wait. This timeline must be expedited and should begin immediately.
To provide some transparency to the community, please provide answers to the following questions:
Why did USACE—St. Louis District not previously prioritize testing these residential properties along Coldwater Creek?
When was USACE made aware of the contamination you announced publicly on March 4, 2024? And how much time elapsed before you informed residents of the risk?
Are there potentially more contaminated residential properties along Coldwater Creek that USACE has not yet tested but have identified as a potential risk?
If so, when will testing of all residential properties be complete?
Is the contamination on these residential properties a health hazard for those who live in or visit the properties? What sampling are you conducting to confirm this?
Are there other areas outside the 10-year floodplain that USACE plans to test?
Are there other areas of potential contamination outside the 10-year floodplain—old meanders of the creek, locations filled with dirt from the creek, etc.—that USACE does not plan to test?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Fights for Missouri Farmers Amid EU Import Mandates
Date: Friday, March 01, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent letters to U.S. Trade Representative (
USTR
) Katherine Tai and international grain trader, Archer Daniels Midland (
ADM
)’s Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano, regarding the European Union (EU)’s new environmental mandate prohibiting the import of certain commodities, such as soybeans, if they do not satisfy specific EU “deforestation” standards. Senator Hawley urges Tai and Luciano to consider the impact on Missouri farmers.
The implementation of this foreign law on U.S. soil will cause farmers to travel lengthy distances and incur additional costs to sell their products. ADM’s enforcement of this law, such as by restricting the use of its facilities and grain elevators, will be detrimental to Missouri farmers.
In his letter to USTR Senator Hawley wrote, “This is fundamentally unfair: since the EUDR was passed in 2023, there is no way that American farmers could have adjusted their post-2020 practices to prepare in advance for this mandate. Countless farmers will now be disqualified from the European market through no fault of their own.”
In his letter to ADM Senator Hawley wrote, “[ADM’s] decision will devastate Missouri farmers. Farmers whose soybeans are ‘out of compliance’ with European law will be forced to sell them elsewhere, with all the attendant costs and burdens.”

Title: Hawley Introduces New Bill to Raise Tariffs on Chinese EVs, Protect American Autoworkers
Date: Wednesday, February 28, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
Protecting American Autoworkers from China Act, new legislation that would counter the threat posed to the U.S. auto industry by raising tariffs on autos imported from China and closing the backdoor Chinese automakers use to evade U.S. trade laws.
“If Joe Biden wants to support American autoworkers, he should start by protecting them from the existential threat posed by China,”
said Senator Hawley. “We must put American workers first, bring jobs back to American soil, and reject radical climate mandates that make China rich and America poor.”
The
Protecting American Autoworkers from China Act
comes in the wake of Joe Biden’s
sweeping mandates
on the American auto industry to force a transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Under these radical Green New Deal rules, as many as two-thirds of all autos sold in the United States would be EVs by the 2030s.
China
dominates
the global market for autos today, especially EVs and their component parts. And Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda and EV mandates will make America even more dependent on China’s auto industry. The United States must take action to prioritize the American auto industry and its workers.
The
Protecting American Autoworkers from China Act
would:
Increase the base tariff rate of auto imports from China to 100 percent, for a total tariff of 125 percent on all imported autos from China.
Apply the higher tariffs to all imported autos manufactured by Chinese automakers, irrespective of where the car is manufactured.
This means Chinese manufacturers cannot use other nations, such as Mexico, as a backdoor to avoid these new tariffs.

Title: Hawley to Google CEO Over Woke Gemini AI Program: ‘Come testify to Congress. Under oath. In public.’
Date: Wednesday, February 28, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
blasted
Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the company’s woke Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) tool and called for him to testify about it, under oath, to Congress.
The AI program
received
backlash after depicting a litany of historically inaccurate images and text in service of the left’s DEI agenda – including generating
the Pope as a black woman
and
claiming
there was “no definitive proof” that Hamas committed sexual violence during the October 7 attacks on Israel.
Come testify to Congress. Under oath. In public.
https://t.co/S4WukHUuE6
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
February 28, 2024
Senator Hawley also reiterated the need to repeal Section 230 and allow Americans to sue AI companies. He has previously introduced
bipartisan legislation
to clarify that Section 230 immunity will not apply to claims based on generative AI, ensuring consumers have the tools they need to protect themselves from harmful content produced by the latest advancements in AI technology, such as the Gemini tool.
If conservatives want to rein in Google Gemini, there’s only one way: repeal Section 230 – and allow Americans to sue these AI companies. If we don’t, they’ll soon control everything: news, information, our data, elections …
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)

Google’s AI just flat out lies to people. And deliberately lies to conservatives. Is this who you want brainwashing your kids? Give people the power to sue these AI companies and put age limits on AI for kids

Title: Hawley Exposes McKinsey Lies and Reintroduces Bill to Crack Down on McKinsey, Management Consultants’ China Contracts
Date: Tuesday, February 27, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
calling out Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, for his apparently false comments in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing
earlier this month. Senator Hawley also
announced
the reintroduction of the
Time to Choose Act
to address the consulting firm’s close ties to China.
Mr. Sternfels, who appeared in a committee hearing on February 6, 2024, told the Senator under oath that his company has “never worked with the Chinese Communist Party or the central government in China, to the best of [his] knowledge.” However, new reporting
reveals that
the Urban China Initiative – a McKinsey-helmed project –released a book that directly contributed to China’s Made in China 2025 industrial plan, which accelerated Chinese trade abuses and the deterioration of U.S.-China relations.
“Your company alleges that its purpose is to “help create positive, enduring change in the world.” You should know that helping totalitarian foreign powers undermine America does not meet that bar. This ugly record can—and must—inform whether the American government, or anyone else, can safely trust your company’s services in the future,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
You can read the full letter
here.
Senator Hawley’s newly reintroduced
Time to Choose Act
would:
Prohibit federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms that hold a contract with the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party, or subsidiaries, affiliates, or proxies thereof.
Impose penalties on consulting firms that intentionally hide or misrepresent contracts with the Chinese entities described above, including:
Terminating affected federal contracts.
Debarring relevant firms from future work with the federal government.
Requiring relevant firms to pay damages equivalent to three times the amount spent by the U.S. government on or in support of the solicitation, selection, or performance of such contracts, pursuant to the False Claims Act.

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from USPS on Mail Service Delays in Kansas City, Across Missouri
Date: Tuesday, February 27, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,
sent a letter
to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, raising concerns over the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) inconsistent mail service to Missourians in Kansas City and across the state.
“Recent reports show Missourians are continuing to experience delayed mail delivery. Some have even allegedly stopped receiving mail altogether. This is unacceptable,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“I encourage you to work with local post offices to ensure all necessary steps are taken to resolve this issue once and for all. Regular access to federal mail services through the USPS is a lifeline that keeps businesses open and families connected. It is crucial that Missourians can rely on USPS to carry out its essential services and provide the nation with reliable and affordable mail service.”
In September 2022, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the USPS Inspector General, pushing for answers on reports of consistent mail service delays in the Kansas City Northland area.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee oversees the USPS.

February 27, 2024
Mr. Louis DeJoy
Postmaster General
United States Postal Service
475 L’Enfant Plaza SW
Washington, DC 20260
Dear Postmaster General Dejoy,
I write with concern over recent reports that the United States Postal Service (USPS) continues to provide inconsistent service to citizens of Kansas City and across the state of Missouri. I urge you to promptly address this issue in cooperation with local Missouri post offices.
Recent reports show Missourians are continuing to experience delayed mail delivery. Some have even allegedly stopped receiving mail altogether. This is unacceptable. On September 28, 2022, I sent a letter to USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) Tammy Hull requesting an investigation and audit into a series of service complaints surrounding these inconsistent deliveries. But it seems that you have not fixed the problem.
On August 31, 2023, Inspector General Hull completed and published the report providing six recommendations to address inconsistent mail delivery. These include implementing plans to hire and retain employees, developing and implementing a plan to verify delayed mail, and requiring management to review package scanning performance at all postal facilities. These recommendations should be implemented so that Missouri residents can enjoy reliable delivery services.
I encourage you to work with local post offices to ensure all necessary steps are taken to resolve this issue once and for all. Regular access to federal mail services through the USPS is a lifeline that keeps businesses open and families connected. It is crucial that Missourians can rely on USPS to carry out its essential services and provide the nation with reliable and affordable mail service.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by March 15, 2024:
1.) Do you agree with the recommendations from the United States Postal Service Office of the Inspector General?
2.) How is your office assisting the USPS Kansas-Missouri District and the USPS Midwest Division in implementing the recommendations made by the USPS Inspector General regarding improving mail delivery in the Kansas City area?
3.) What issues has the United States Postal Service experienced in implementing steps to correct inconsistent mail delivery?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Urges Colleagues to Reauthorize Radiation Compensation Program for American Victims Before Funding Expires
Date: Monday, February 26, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to his Republican colleagues in the Senate,
urging
them to reauthorize the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) which is set to expire this spring. Without this critical funding, American victims of Manhattan Project-era radiation will be denied the compensation they need to treat diseases and cancers caused by the federal government’s nuclear waste.
“It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned. We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it. If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
Background
Senator Hawley has been a leading voice in the fight to make radiation victims in
Missouri
—and across the nation—whole. Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
delivered
remarks on the Senate floor, blasting Senate leadership for shoveling billions of dollars to foreign wars while ignoring Americans who have been poisoned by the federal government through its atomic program.

here
or below.
February 26, 2024
Dear Republican Colleagues:
I write to bring to your attention the critical importance of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which is set to expire this spring. We owe it to our constituents who have been exposed to government-caused radiation to extend and update this program as soon as possible. The government lied to our constituents time and again about their exposure to nuclear radiation. This legislation is the least the government can do to put right this historic wrong.
First enacted in 1990 with the support of the late Senator Orrin Hatch and President George H.W. Bush, RECA is a compensation program for Americans who were unknowingly exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project and later Cold War testing programs. Uranium mines were staffed by workers who were often given no safety equipment. Processing sites for nuclear material were situated too close to populated areas. Nuclear waste was improperly stored: at one site in Missouri, the government discarded nuclear waste in leaky barrels in the open air, later contaminating a local creek where thousands of children played over decades. Many of those children now have cancer. Tens of thousands of other Americans were exposed to radiation “downwind” from over 100 atmospheric tests in western States. In most cases, nobody was warned of this danger. In others, the government simply lied. Repeatedly.
RECA is an effort to make this right. The law on the books acknowledges that these Americans “were subjected to increased risk of injury and disease to serve the national security interests of the United States.” To date, RECA has compensated 40,000 Americans who developed cancers through a claims process run by the Department of Justice. It has been updated on several occasions. But there are still Americans waiting to have their claims processed. And many affected Americans—miners in Texas and Wyoming, downwinders in Idaho and Utah, residents near test sites or processing facilities in Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and Missouri—have been left out. We must change this now.
It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned. We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it. If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help.
I ask for your support to reauthorize the life-saving RECA program. I want to thank Senator Crapo for his years of leadership on this issue. Our reauthorization bill passed the Senate last summer with a strong bipartisan vote, and I am grateful for much support from our Conference. Now we must finish the job. There are RECA claimants in every state, including each of yours. They will benefit if this bill is passed. Simply put, this is the right thing to do.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Calls on DOJ to Block Capital One-Discover Merger

U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Justice (DOJ) Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter, urging him to
block the merger

“This is destructive corporate consolidation at its starkest. If consummated, this merger will create a new juggernaut in the credit card market, with unprecedented powers to extort American consumers. That cannot be allowed to happen,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
Yesterday, Senator Hawley

Jonathan Kanter
Assistant Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division
Main Justice Building, Room 1137
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter:
On February 19, Capital One—one of America’s largest and most powerful banks—announced its plans to acquire Discover Financial Services for $35 billion, bringing 300 million Discover card users into its existing fold of 100 million customers. As the Wall Street Journal reported, this merger will create “the third largest credit-card issuer by purchase volume” and “the sixth largest U.S. bank by assets.”
This is destructive corporate consolidation at its starkest. If consummated, this merger will create a new juggernaut in the credit card market, with unprecedented powers to extort American consumers. That cannot be allowed to happen.
It is market competition—meaningful competition—that provides consumers with their strongest defense against a handful of predatory firms. Credit card interest rates are already out of control. Many major card rates recently soared past 30%, and cumulative credit card debt exceeds $1 trillion. That’s why I introduced legislation last year, the Capping Credit Card Interest Rates Act, which would place commonsense restrictions on companies’ ability to burden consumers with these rates. But robust competition in this sector is the most lasting antidote to this problem. And it is precisely that competition which this new proposed merger endangers.
You, in partnership with other regulators, must take the lead in blocking this merger. No doubt a legion of proxies and allies for the financial industry will soon emerge, claiming that this proposed deal will benefit consumers. That is doubtful. If the last several decades of American political economy indicate anything at all, it’s that the supposed benefits of monopoly never trickle down to the public at large. Instead, consolidation redounds to the benefit of shareholders and a handful of top executives—not ordinary Americans. That pattern is poised to play out once again.
I urge you to take the first opportunity available to challenge this bad deal.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Votes Against Senate Leadership’s Bill to Bankroll Ukraine While Overlooking Nuclear Radiation Victims in U.S.
Date: Tuesday, February 13, 2024

Content:
This morning Senator Hawley voted against the multibillion-dollar foreign aid
package
put forth by Senate leadership, criticizing the legislation for fueling the U.S. Defense Industrial Complex while neglecting to compensate nuclear-radiation victims at home, within America’s own borders.
Last night Senator Hawley spoke on the Senate floor where he
blasted
Senate leadership for prioritizing unchecked military aid for Ukraine’s war and the country’s private sector over funding for American nuclear-radiation victims who have not seen compensation after decades of suffering.
Congressional leadership has
repeatedly overlooked
Americans poisoned by the federal government through its atomic program. Following its passage in the Senate in
July, reauthorization for the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) was
stripped
from the NDAA in a back-room deal cut by congressional leadership.

resolution
congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs on their Super Bowl victory. The resolution – cosponsored by U.S. Senator Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) – honors the team, the dedicated fans, the Chiefs dynasty, and the Kansas City community.
“Congratulations to Andy Reid, all the players, and Chiefs Kingdom on their Super Bowl victory. These guys played an extraordinary game. They’ve brought Kansas City a dynasty,”
said Senator Hawley.
“I couldn’t be prouder of the Kansas City Chiefs for their 10-point comeback to secure their third Super Bowl win in five years. After being counted out all season long, and being told they weren’t the same dominant team as in years past, they showed up where it counts most against a phenomenal 49ers squad.

Title: Hawley to Garland: Invoke the 25th or Prosecute Biden

Senator Hawley also reacted to President Biden’s effort to rebut Special Counsel Hur’s allegations of serious mental decline after the President addressed the nation Thursday night in a speech

Title: Hawley Files RECA Amendment to Senate Supplemental, Joins Advocates on Capitol Hill in Renewed Push to Compensate Radiation Victims
Date: Thursday, February 08, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
filed an amendment
to reauthorize and expand the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) to the foreign aid package currently being debated in the Senate. Senator Hawley’s amendment—which
passed the Senate
last year with overwhelming bipartisan support—has been updated to include compensation for communities devastated by decades-old nuclear waste in Alaska, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
Senator Hawley joined advocates from across America for their visit during today’s key votes in the upper chamber, urging congressional leadership not to overlook Americans poisoned by their own government in favor of funding to foreign nations.
“My message is to my leadership—and certainly to Senator McConnell—is don’t let Americans die. […] Hundreds of thousands of people, who depend on this program for lifesaving help, will be left literally to die if this program expires. And the people around me that you see will get no help unless we do something,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Since I offered the [RECA amendment] last time, we’ve included communities now in Tennessee and Kentucky and Alaska, who’ve all been exposed to radiation. […] More advocates came to us and said, ‘hey what about us?’ […] So, I am not going to sit back and watch [RECA] expire. We’ve got to get it reauthorized. We’ve got to get it updated,”
Senator Hawley concluded.
Background:
The RECA program—which is set to expire in a matter of months—compensates victims of nuclear radiation from the Manhattan Project.
Following its passage in the Senate in
July, RECA reauthorization was
stripped
from the NDAA by
congressional leadership. Senator Hawley has committed to doing whatever it takes to reauthorize this vital legislation and bring justice to victims of government-caused nuclear radiation.

Title: Hawley Warns Aluminum Plant Owner of Potential Labor Law Violation, Urges Him to Resume Production, Save Missouri Jobs
Date: Wednesday, February 07, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Matt Lucke, owner of Magnitude 7 Metals in Marston, Missouri. Senator Hawley urged Mr. Lucke to re-open the plant and warned him of his potential violation of the WARN Act that deprives his workers of compensation they are owed under federal law.
Last week, Senator Hawley
urged
President Biden to use the
Defense Production Act
to prevent the shutdown of Magnitude 7 Metals to preserve good-paying union jobs and safeguard national security.
“Shutting down this production deprives Missouri of good-paying jobs and the nation of essential manufacturing of a critical mineral. Your actions are a mistake that harms this nation,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “I urge you to resume production because so many families depend on these jobs. But if you choose not to, you must give your employees the compensation they deserve under the law.”

Matt Lucke
Magnitude 7 Metals
St. Jude Industrial Park Highway
Marston, Missouri 63866
Dear Mr. Lucke,
Let me get straight to it. Your decision to shut down production at Magnitude 7 Metals, the aluminum plant in Marston, Missouri that you own, devastates working families and undermines U.S. national security. Moreover, the way you shut down production appears to violate federal labor law. You need to reopen the plant, immediately. If you do not, you must give your employees the compensation they are entitled to get under U.S. labor law—or face hefty civil fines. It is not too late to do right by your workers.
Before you decided to curtail production, Magnitude 7 Metals was one of three primary aluminum manufacturers in the United States and operated one of a handful of the nation’s active smelters. Your company’s annual production capacity was 263,000 metric tons, which accounted for almost 30 percent of the nation’s overall capacity. Shutting down this production deprives Missouri of good-paying jobs and the nation of essential manufacturing of a critical mineral. Your actions are a mistake that harms this nation.
Should you insist on keeping the plant shuttered, you may well be in violation of federal labor law. As you know, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 requires employers like Magnitude 7 Metals to give employees 60 days’ notice before closing a plant. 29 U.S.C. § 2102. It does not appear that Magnitude 7 Metals adhered to the notice requirement provided under the WARN Act. On January 24, 2024, your company provided written notice of an impending shutdown to occur only four days later—far short of the 60-day notice requirement.
Businesses that violate the WARN Act in this way are liable for back pay and benefits to each aggrieved employee for each day short of 60 that they failed to give notice. They are also liable for civil fines, which could exceed $10 million in your case. The way to avoid these penalties is to pay each wronged employee backpay and benefits for the 60-day period within three weeks of the date the employer ordered the shutdown.
I urge you to resume production at Magnitude 7 Metals to ensure the United States retains the capacity to produce primary aluminum. I urge you to resume production because so many families depend on these jobs. But if you choose not to, you must give your employees the compensation they deserve under the law.
I look forward to your prompt attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: The Border Bill’s Assault on American Workers
Date: Tuesday, February 06, 2024

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Feb. 5, 2024 |
Compact Magazine
This week, the Senate is supposedly voting on the biggest immigration overhaul in decades.  That is a polite way of saying that US workers are on the chopping block. The Senate’s “border deal” is a terrible bargain hashed out behind closed doors, one that sells out the American working class in favor of illegal immigrants, the biggest corporations, and Wall Street.
[…]
America’s big corporations want cheap labor. They don’t want to raise wages or improve working conditions. They’d prefer to maintain the status quo of stagnant wages, unsafe workplaces, increasingly oppressive scheduling practices, and countless other harms. They want employees who will work as cheaply as possible, which means they want massive immigration flows—legal and illegal—to continue.
At the heart of the new border bill is a radical idea: legal provisions that, after a quick intake screening, would grant immediate work authorization to individuals requesting asylum.
[…]
If illegal immigrants could get this immediate work authorization—without fear of removal—we can expect a huge influx of migrants claiming asylum purely to get these benefits. Would they ever be heard from again? Doubtful. And second, the bill would allow employers to slash wages for American workers. Why risk employing an American citizen—who might be a member of a union and might insist on fair treatment—when you can hire illegal aliens newly authorized to work?
Any talk of automatic-shutdown provisions in the bill—that the gates would shut for the day when a few thousand individuals have been processed—is nonsense. Under the bill, the president would retain the power to override any such shutdown, and it is obvious that President Biden would do just that.
[…]
But make no mistake: This bill is, above all, a betrayal of American workers. Congress is poised to hand employers the ultimate anti-worker kryptonite: a shadow army of reserve labor, at the service of companies that have plenty of cash for dividends and stock buybacks, but somehow never enough to pay American workers a fair wage. After decades of flatlining pay and deteriorating protections, American labor deserves better. And a backroom deal like this isn’t merely bad policy—it is insulting.

Title: Hawley Hammers McKinsey, Blasts Company for its China Ties & Role in Opioid Epidemic
Date: Tuesday, February 06, 2024

Content:
Today in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing on foreign influence in the United States, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called out
McKinsey & Company for its litany of contracts with companies engaged with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
“If [McKinsey] is going to advise foreign nations who are hostile to us and make gobs of money off of them, why should you be getting U.S. government contracts?”
Senator Hawley asked Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company.
“Your work right now, taking money from this government, as you help the Chinese Communist Party is absolutely unforgivable, and I will not rest until it is illegal,”
he concluded.

Senator Hawley also hammered McKinsey & Company’s contribution to the ongoing opioid epidemic in Missouri and across the U.S.
“Since I represent the state of Missouri that has been absolutely devastated by the opioid crisis—and I know you know a lot about that because speaking of money, McKinsey had made an unbelievable amount of money off of the opioid crisis,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“You don’t think marketing these drugs to doctors and children helped cause the epidemic? You don’t think [McKinsey] has any part in that?”

Senator Hawley has
previously introduced
the
Time to Choose Act
which would prohibit the Department of Defense and other federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms like McKinsey & Company who are simultaneously providing services to the Chinese government or its affiliates. The bill would force these government contractors to choose whether to stand with the United States in its efforts to protect Americans against China’s imperial ambitions, or forfeit U.S. government contracts.
In 2020, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to McKinsey & Company, blasting its proposal to ensure sales of Purdue Pharma’s OxyContin by paying pharmacies bounties for opioid overdoses.

Title: Democrat Blocks Hawley Effort to Pass Bipartisan Bill to Hold Big Tech Accountable & Crack Down on Child Sex Abuse Material Online
Date: Tuesday, February 06, 2024

Content:
Tonight U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor and called for unanimous consent on
bipartisan legislation
to crack down on the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. The
STOP CSAM Act
would empower victims to bring civil suits against Big Tech platforms that knowingly host CSAM content.
“These companies are the most profitable companies in the world. They are the biggest companies in the history of the world […] Here they are making hand over fist on destroying America’s children […] This is the only industry in the country that can make a product that will literally kill you, and if it does, you cannot do anything about it,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “This body almost thirty years ago gave these corporations a total blanket immunity that they cannot be held responsible […] Until victims can get into court and have the rights and dignity of every other American, challenging any other company, this will not change. Congress created this problem. Congress created it by giving the most powerful companies in the world a sweetheart deal.”
Watch the full clip
here
or click the image above.
Senator Hawley’s call to unanimously pass the bill was objected to by Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).
Following Senator Wyden’s objection, Senator Hawley noted that the
STOP CSAM Act
has unanimous bipartisan support in the Judiciary committee, and he committed to forcing votes on the legislation as long as it takes to get justice for the victims.
Background
Last week in a Senate Judiciary hearing, Senator Hawley
pressed
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about child exploitation on his social media platforms. Zuckerberg stood up and apologized to the families of victims of child exploitation in the hearing room, but would not commit to compensating the families who have suffered as a consequence of his inaction.
In May 2023, Senator Hawley and Senator Durbin
reached
an agreement to advance the
STOP CSAM Act, which then passed the Committee unanimously. After the adoption of his amendments, Senator Hawley
joined the bill
as the first Republican cosponsor of the legislation.

for victims of online exploitation across Meta’s platforms. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, Senator Hawley
pressed Zuckerberg
about child exploitation on his social media platforms,
forcing the Big Tech CEO to apologize
his lack of action to protect children online.
“According to your company’s own internal metrics, within a 7-day window, 24% of Instagram users between the ages of 13 and 15 receive unwanted sexual advances, 37% encounter nudity, and 17% encounter content on self-harm,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“You were made aware of these extraordinary statistics directly by your employees and did not respond—nor do you admit to firing anyone.”
He continued,
“You amassed your fortune from Facebook’s growth; but while your platform grew, so did its role in enabling child exploitation. Now you must make financial decisions with moral purpose. With just a 10 percent donation of your net worth to a victim’s compensation fund, you can provide thousands of victimized children with counseling services, you can reimburse burial services for families who lost a loved one, and you can provide resources to all victims to help get their dignity back. Your company, Meta, should also contribute from its vast revenues to help compensate these victims.”

Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
Yesterday, you publicly apologized to the families of children exploited by your platforms. That apology was long overdue. Now you can show the world that you were sincere. I urge you to immediately create a fund endowed by your own personal wealth for the purpose of compensating those who have been victimized by your platforms. These families can never be made whole—but they can get some measure of justice and accountability from you.
Every day, Meta’s products harm children and families. This has been made perfectly clear by investigations, whistleblower disclosures, and by the families personally present to watch you testify under oath. According to your company’s own internal metrics, within a 7-day window, 24% of Instagram users between the ages of 13 and 15 receive unwanted sexual advances, 37% encounter nudity, and 17% encounter content on self-harm. You were made aware of these extraordinary statistics directly by your employees and did not respond—nor do you admit to firing anyone. This is a stunning abdication of responsibility to the children who use your products.
But it’s not too late for you to work to provide justice. Your personal wealth—estimated at an enormous $140 billion—can go a long way to help ease the suffering. You amassed your fortune from Facebook’s growth; but while your platform grew, so did its role in enabling child exploitation. Now you must make financial decisions with moral purpose. With just a 10 percent donation of your net worth to a victim’s compensation fund, you can provide thousands of victimized children with counseling services, you can reimburse burial services for families who lost a loved one, and you can provide resources to all victims to help get their dignity back. Your company, Meta, should also contribute from its vast revenues to help compensate these victims.
You have the ability to transform not only your platform, but also the lives of every child your products have harmed over the last decade. I urge you to seize this chance to do it.

“Your job is to be responsible for what your company has done. You have made billions of dollars on the people sitting behind you here. You’ve done nothing to help them, you’ve done nothing to compensate them, and you’ve done nothing to put it right. You could do so here today, and you should,”

Title: Hawley Urges Oscars to Recognize American Victims of Nuclear Testing, as “Oppenheimer” Film Reaps Honors
Date: Friday, January 26, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences urging them to recognize
American victims of nuclear testing
as they prepare for the 2024 Academy Awards. Senator Hawley’s letter comes as the Academy announced the 2023 summer blockbuster “Oppenheimer”—which chronicles the Manhattan Project’s nuclear testing—is the leading film, receiving 13 award nominations.
“As you continue preparations for the ceremony on March 10, I write to urge you to include programming that recognizes the victims of America’s nuclear testing,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“The Oppenheimer film tells a compelling story of these test programs. But it does not tell the story of the Americans left behind—still reckoning with the health and financial consequences of America’s nuclear research, after all these years. Shouldn’t the victims who are still paying the price have a voice, too?”
He continued,
“The Oppenheimer film closes with a haunting image of the world consumed in nuclear fire. That particular future has not yet come to pass. But countless good Americans have already paid a price for their government’s negligence in testing and failure to clear up nuclear waste. They have the right to be heard on a national stage—especially yours.”
Senator Hawley has been fighting for Congress to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECA) before it expires in a few short months. Last year, his NDAA amendment to do so passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support but was ultimately
stripped from the final version
of the bill by Congressional leadership. Senator Hawley has
vowed to continue working
to pass the renewal and make American victims of nuclear radiation whole.

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
8949 Wilshire Boulevard
Beverly Hills, California 90211
Dear Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences:
This week, the Academy announced its full slate of nominees for the 2024 Academy Awards. Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer is in the lead, with 13 award nominations across a variety of categories. Public interest in J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life story has never been greater, and the ongoing significance of his legacy will undoubtedly be a major focus at the 96th Academy Awards.
As you continue preparations for the ceremony on March 10, I write to urge you to include programming that recognizes the victims of America’s nuclear testing. The Oppenheimer film tells a compelling story of these test programs. But it does not tell the story of the Americans left behind—still reckoning with the health and financial consequences of America’s nuclear research, after all these years. Shouldn’t the victims who are still paying the price have a voice, too?
Across the nation, thousands of Americans currently suffer from cancer and other debilitating medical conditions, brought on by long-term radiation exposure. In places like my home state of Missouri, the radioactive waste of the Manhattan Project was never fully cleaned up. In many Western states, Americans living downwind from nuclear tests were never told the truth of their exposure and its consequences. In both cases, innocent people have suffered for decades. And now Congress stands poised to allow what limited compensation the government has offered victims to expire. That cannot be allowed to happen. These victims deserve justice through fair compensation from their government—and you can help by telling their stories.
The Oppenheimer film closes with a haunting image of the world consumed in nuclear fire. That particular future has not yet come to pass. But countless good Americans have already paid a price for their government’s negligence in testing and failure to clear up nuclear waste. They have the right to be heard on a national stage—especially yours.

Title: Hawley Demands Biden Use Defense Production Act to Save Missouri Aluminum Plant and Union Jobs
Date: Thursday, January 25, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to President Joe Biden, urging him to use the Defense Production Act
to prevent the shutdown
of Magnitude 7 Metals—an aluminum manufacturer in Marston, Mo., that accounts for nearly 30 percent of the nation’s primary aluminum production. Senator Hawley warned that the closure of Magnitude 7 Metals would deliver a devastating blow to working families in Missouri and undermine U.S. national security.
“Magnitude 7 Metals’ ‘curtailment’ of its aluminum smelter will put more than 500 workers out of a job by Sunday, January 28, 2024,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
The impending shutdown of the smelter will also materially degrade our defense posture, as the Department of Defense has deemed aluminum a strategic material of interest.”
He continued,
“As recently as 2000, the United States ranked as the world’s largest producer of primary aluminum. However, the United States now accounts for less than 2 percent of global primary aluminum. This steep production decline results from several factors, including state-led overproduction in China that has led Chinese aluminum manufacturers to dump subsidized aluminum into global markets, thereby depressing the commodity’s price and undermining U.S. manufacturers’ financial viability.”
“To this end, I urge you to take all appropriate actions, including invocation of the Defense Production Act of 1950, to prevent the shutdown of Magnitude 7 Metals. Doing so will preserve good-paying union jobs and safeguard national security,”
Senator Hawley concluded.

January 25, 2024
The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
President of the United States
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear President Biden,
I write with alarm regarding yesterday’s announcement that Magnitude 7 Metals—a primary aluminum manufacturer based in Marston, Missouri—has shut down production at its aluminum smelter. Not only is this development a devastating blow to working families and good-paying union jobs in my state, but it directly threatens the national economic security of the United States. This smelter accounts for nearly 30 percent of the nation’s primary aluminum production. I urge you to take the appropriate actions necessary to keep the smelter open, to ensure the continuity of operations, and to preserve production jobs—including by deploying the authorities of the Defense Production Act of 1950.
Magnitude 7 Metals’ “curtailment” of its aluminum smelter will put more than 500 workers out of a job by Sunday, January 28, 2024. The impending shutdown of the smelter will also materially degrade our defense posture, as the Department of Defense has deemed aluminum a strategic material of interest.
Magnitude 7 Metals is one of three primary aluminum manufacturers in the United States and operates one of handful of active smelters nationwide. Its annual production capacity is 263,000 metric tons, which accounts for almost 30 percent of the nation’s overall capacity, according to some estimates. As you know, primary aluminum is used in various industrial goods, including aircraft, automobiles, solar panels, and many types of military equipment. The Department of Defense has deemed aluminum a strategic material of interest mainly because of the latter.
Primary aluminum production has declined in the United States during the past two decades—catastrophically. As recently as 2000, the United States ranked as the world’s largest producer of primary aluminum. However, the United States now accounts for less than 2 percent of global primary aluminum. This steep production decline results from several factors, including state-led overproduction in China that has led Chinese aluminum manufacturers to dump subsidized aluminum into global markets, thereby depressing the commodity’s price and undermining U.S. manufacturers’ financial viability.
The precipitous decline of the primary aluminum industry and the importance of aluminum for U.S. national security informed the Trump Administration’s decision to impose 10 percent tariffs on aluminum products, pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. However, in the past 18 months, two other primary aluminum smelters have been curtailed, one in Washington and another in Kentucky. The curtailment of Magnitude 7 Metal’s smelter makes a third. It’s clear more must be done to stabilize and revitalize the nation’s primary aluminum industry.
To this end, I urge you to take all appropriate actions, including invocation of the Defense Production Act of 1950, to prevent the shutdown of Magnitude 7 Metals. Doing so will preserve good-paying union jobs and safeguard national security.
I look forward to your prompt attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Peters Urge Postal Service to Reopen Post Office Destroyed in Baring, Mo., Tornado & Prioritize Rural Communities’ Infrastructure
Date: Thursday, January 25, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) – a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) – and HSGAC Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.)
sent a letter
to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy urging the United States Postal Service (USPS) to reopen the Baring, Mo., Post Office. The Senators also requested that the USPS reopen other post offices it has placed under “emergency suspension” due to natural disasters or the need for repairs. Senators Hawley and Peters’ letter comes after the USPS claimed that within 90 days it expected to have a timeline for rebuilding the Baring, Mo., Post Office.
“The Baring facility closed after receiving severe tornado damage in August 2023, but residents have received no information about when it will be reopened,”
the Senators wrote.
This situation reflects similar delays nationwide in repairing post offices and resolving suspensions, which USPS should promptly address.
They continued,
“As you know, Americans living in rural areas face severe challenges to daily life without a functioning post office. This includes significant barriers to accessing reliable medical delivery, payment disbursements, and communications. We urge you to finalize and disclose USPS’s plan to reopen the Baring Post Office within 30 calendar days. We also urge you to cooperate with the PRC by providing detailed plans and timelines for resolving all post offices suspended from 2017 through 2023.
Following
a letter sent
to Postmaster General DeJoy in September seeking an update on the status of the Post Office in Baring, Mo., Senator Hawley introduced the
Rural Post Office Reconstruction Act of 2023. This legislation would establish a clear timeframe for reopening rural post offices that experience closure due to natural disaster damage or other unforeseen circumstances.

Mr. Louis DeJoy
Postmaster General
United States Postal Service
475 L’Enfant Plaza SW
Washington, DC 20260
Dear Postmaster General DeJoy:
We write to request an update on reopening the Post Office in Baring, Missouri and urge you to expeditiously reopen other post offices that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has placed under “emergency suspension” due to natural disasters or the need for repairs. The Baring post office and other suspended post offices remain critical lifelines for constituents in rural areas and other USPS customers.
The Baring facility closed after receiving severe tornado damage in August 2023, but residents have received no information about when it will be reopened. This situation reflects similar delays nationwide in repairing post offices and resolving suspensions, which USPS should promptly address.
On September 6, 2023, Senator Hawley sent a letter to USPS requesting the expeditious reopening of the Baring Post Office building In response, USPS claimed that within 90 days, it expected to have a timeline for rebuilding the facility, in cooperation with the building’s landlord. USPS policies also require it to develop a “plan of action” for resolving a post office emergency suspension within 3 months of the suspension. Although 90 days have now passed since USPS’s reply, USPS has not shared this timeline or additional details on when Baring’s post office will reopen.
Post offices closed due to “emergency suspension” are a concern for USPS customers nationwide. Since this initial letter, we have heard about this issue on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee from Commissioner Robert G. Taub of the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), who affirmed that USPS tends to “drag their feet” in decisions to resolve suspended post offices like the Baring Post Office.[6] In its oversight of suspended post offices, the PRC highlighted that at the end of FY 2022, there were 381 suspended post offices, including 88 post office suspensions that remain unresolved since 2017 and 98 newly suspended in FY22.[1] As of the end of 2023, USPS reported to the PRC that there are a total of 373 suspended post offices. The PRC has ordered USPS to provide a detailed plan and timeline for resolving post offices suspended in recent years (from FY 2017 through FY 2023).
As you know, Americans living in rural areas face severe challenges to daily life without a functioning post office. This includes significant barriers to accessing reliable medical delivery, payment disbursements, and communications. We urge you to finalize and disclose USPS’s plan to reopen the Baring Post Office within 30 calendar days. We also urge you to cooperate with the PRC by providing detailed plans and timelines for resolving all post offices suspended from 2017 through 2023.
As members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight over USPS, we know the important work that USPS performs on a daily basis for millions of Americans. We are committed to ensuring USPS maintains a high level of service for all customers, including for rural residents and those impacted by natural disasters.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Files NetChoice v. Paxton Amicus Brief with Supreme Court to Fight Big Tech’s Censorship Crusade
Date: Wednesday, January 24, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
filed an amicus brief
with the U.S. Supreme Court in Texas’ case
NetChoice v. Paxton
to
define Big Tech platforms’ role
in disseminating users’ speech.
In his brief, Senator Hawley argues that the Supreme Court must narrow Big Tech’s power by defining whether these social media companies are self-conscious editors of content or neutral platforms that simply host users’ posts. He urges the Supreme Court not to permit Big Tech to algorithmically promote
virulent, pro-terrorist propaganda
while claiming a right to
censor conservatives’ free speech. Senator Hawley brings this illogical contradiction to light as he argues in favor of Texas’ anti-censorship law.
“Big Tech companies want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to censor users’ content while not being held accountable by either the government or private lawsuits,”
said Senator Hawley, in response to filing his brief.
“The Court should rule in favor of Texas’ anti-censorship law and not grant the tech companies’ wish to be above the law.”
Senator Hawley has been a longtime advocate for holding Big Tech companies accountable and fighting for Americans’ rights on their platforms, including by introducing
multiple
pieces
of legislation empowering users to sue Big Tech for the harm they cause.
In December 2022, Senator Hawley
filed an amicus brief
with the Supreme Court in the case of
Gonzalez v. Google, challenging the Section 230 immunity Big Tech companies receive for their algorithmic recommendations.

Title: Hawley Blasts Mayorkas for Record Number of Illegal ‘Gotaways’ Crossing the Border Without CBP Apprehension
Date: Wednesday, January 24, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling out his failure to secure the southern border. A new
report
reveals that in fiscal year 2023 alone, 860,000 illegal immigrants crossed into the United States without encountering a border official.
“These ‘gotaways’ outnumber the combined populations of Kansas City and St. Louis, the two largest cities in Missouri,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “At the very least, you owe the American people full transparency into what your Department knows about illegal immigrants who have entered our nation without being stopped or tracked.”
He continued, “It is abundantly clear that the longer you remain in office, the worse the crisis at our southern border becomes. […] These unprecedented figures underscore the need for you to be fully transparent about your Department’s own accounting of the southern border crisis.”

January 24, 2024
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretary Mayorkas:
The numbers tell the tale: you have utterly failed to secure the southern border. According to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a record-setting 860,000 illegal immigrants crossed into the United States without encountering a border official in fiscal year 2023 alone. These “gotaways” outnumber the combined populations of Kansas City and St. Louis, the two largest cities in Missouri. At the very least, you owe the American people full transparency into what your Department knows about illegal immigrants who have entered our nation without being stopped or tracked.
It is abundantly clear that the longer you remain in office, the worse the crisis at our southern border becomes. The yearly number of gotaways has increased dramatically under your watch, up from nearly 600,000 in fiscal year 2022 and more than double the 389,515 in fiscal year 2021. All told, nearly 2 million illegal immigrants have successfully evaded border officials during the Biden Administration. Furthermore, though your Department still has not yet released official numbers, border officials report that they encountered more than 300,000 illegal immigrants at the southern border last month—which would be an all-time high. These unprecedented figures underscore the need for you to be fully transparent about your Department’s own accounting of the southern border crisis.
To date, your Department’s estimates have been totally opaque. The American people deserve direct, concrete answers from your Department regarding the scale and nature of the gotaways problem. Accordingly, please provide the following information by no later than February 6, 2024:
Please provide Congress with the Department of Homeland Security’s full estimates and methodology regarding individuals who have illegally crossed into the U.S. without encountering a border official since January 2021.
Does the Department of Homeland Security corroborate CBO’s estimate of 860,000 gotaways in fiscal year 2023?
How many gotaways does the Department estimate illegally crossed into the U.S. in fiscal year 2023 and were observed doing so?
How many gotaways does the Department estimate illegally crossed into the U.S. in fiscal year 2023 and were not observed doing so?
How many suspected terrorists, violent criminals, and other felons does the Department estimate are among the gotaways in fiscal year 2023?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from TSA After Agency Green-lights Illegal Immigrants to Fly Without Valid Photo ID
Date: Monday, January 22, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator David Pekoske
calling out the agency
for undermining national security by allowing illegal immigrants to board commercial flights without valid photo identification.
“If this report is accurate, this is outrageous,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Millions of Americans are subject to the TSA screening process, which is often a burdensome, long inconvenience—and which includes photo identification. But every day, Americans take on this burden to increase the safety of their fellow passengers.”
He continued,
“Therefore, it makes no sense to give special privileges to illegal immigrants, who should not even be allowed in the United States in the first place, let alone allowed to board U.S. aircraft. This is symbolic of the Biden Administration’s prioritization of open border policies over Americans’ safety.”

here
or below.
January 19, 2024
The Honorable David P. Pekoske
Administrator
Transportation Security Administration
601 12th St S
Arlington, VA 20598
Administrator Pekoske:
I write concerning recent reports that your agency is permitting illegal immigrants to board commercial aircraft without standard forms of photo identification. This practice not only undermines the rule of law but also raises significant security concerns for commercial airflight.
One recent report shows that at the Miami International Airport, migrants are not obligated to use photographic identification at security checkpoints.[1] Specifically, they are permitted to present their alien identification number or biographic information, and choose whether they would like to have their photo taken by the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). The report says this procedure is part of a test initiative between TSA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which uses the CBP One platform at select checkpoints to validate the travel documentation of illegal immigrants.
If this report is accurate, this is outrageous. Millions of Americans are subject to the TSA screening process, which is often a burdensome, long inconvenience—and which includes photo identification. But every day, Americans take on this burden to increase the safety of their fellow passengers. Therefore, it makes no sense to give special privileges to illegal immigrants, who should not even be allowed in the United States in the first place, let alone allowed to board U.S. aircraft. This is symbolic of the Biden Administration’s prioritization of open border policies over Americans’ safety.
This story also fits an emerging pattern. On January 31, 2022, I sent your office a letter expressing my strong disapproval of TSA’s indefensible practice of allowing illegal immigrants to display arrest warrants as identification at security checkpoints.[2] During a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing, you testified that TSA had allowed over one thousand illegal migrants to board aircraft after presenting a warrant for arrest as identification.[3] Rather than remedy the issue, it appears that you have reduced airport security even further by ditching photo identification altogether.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by February 15, 2024:
1.     Please confirm the accuracy of these allegations.
2.     Which DHS component(s) developed this policy?
3.     How many aliens have deferred being photographed to confirm their biographical information?
4.     How many aliens have been able to board U.S. commercial aircraft and were permitted to travel without presenting photographic identification?
5.     How does this new policy comport with 8 U.S.C. § 1325, which criminalizes the improper entry into the United States by an alien?
6.     Please produce all records relating to the development, discussion, and coordination of these policies, including any and all communications with the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security and with the Department of Justice.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces New Legislation to End DHS Funding for Liberal Propaganda
Date: Monday, January 22, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
Ending DHS Funding for Liberal Propaganda Act
to prevent the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from distributing grant funds to organizations that promote discrimination against conservative viewpoints.
Just last week,
reporting
revealed that DHS paid leftist academics to create propaganda to “counter” conservatives, under the guise of “media literacy.”
“The Biden Administration has time and again demonstrated its willingness to weaponize its power against conservatives,”
said Senator Hawley. “My bill simply bars Secretary Mayorkas from funneling taxpayer dollars to programs dedicated to targeting this Administration’s political opponents.”
This legislation follows Senator Hawley’s
letter
to Secretary Mayorkas calling out the agency’s weaponization of taxpayer dollars to attack conservatives.
The
Ending DHS Funding for Liberal Propaganda Act
will:
Stop DHS grant funding from being shipped to entities that will use the funds for viewpoint discrimination, particularly against conservatives.
Ensure that taxpayer dollars do not flow to programs that engage in partisan political advocacy or discriminate on the basis of political affiliation.
Bar DHS from distributing grants to entities that will use the funds to counter political narratives or views on issues such as COVID-19, immigration, and crime.

Title: Hawley Calls Out Democrats who Labeled Republicans Racist for Questioning Nominee Linked to Pro-Hamas Organization
Date: Thursday, January 18, 2024

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called out Democrats
in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for labeling him and other Republican colleagues as racists after questioning judicial nominee Adeel Mangi—who formerly served on the board of a pro-Hamas organization—about his views on terrorism. In December, Senator Hawley
questioned this Biden judicial nominee
who repeatedly refused to answer whether or not he thought Israel was a “violent, settler, colonial state.”
“I resent the insinuation that those of us who asked him questions are somehow anti-Muslim or prejudiced in some way. […] As someone who has worked across the aisle on any number of pieces of legislation, […] I have to say, it’s hard to do when [Democrats] call us anti-Muslim, racists,”
Senator Hawley said.
“I don’t care what his religion is or if he has a religion. I don’t care, but I do care that he was a director of a center that was basically a mouthpiece for Hamas,”
he continued.
And he said over and over all his concerns were academic. My question is, did he not have concerns about Jewish students?”

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
According to new reports, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) paid an activist group $700,000 to “write blog posts that criticized Donald Trump and other conservatives under the guise of ‘media literacy.’” Your Department has consistently weaponized the federal government to attack conservatives using taxpayer dollars, first by colluding with private social media companies to censor conservative viewpoints and now by funding private actors to create affirmative propaganda to “counter” conservatives. This is an outrageous use of federal funds and abuse of power. All these funds should be clawed back by the federal government immediately, and anyone involved in making this grant should be fired.
Your Department provided a grant to the University of Rhode Island’s Media Education Lab to create “counter-propaganda.” This grant was given through the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program, which “provides funding … to prevent targeted violence and terrorism.” In its application, the Lab wrote that it would address “propaganda and misinformation concerning topics including immigration, racial justice, the coronavirus, and vaccination” and “build on top of concerns about so-called ‘fake news’ and ‘cancel culture.’” The Lab planned to use funds to create “counter-propaganda.” Your Department gave them $700,000 to do so.
There appears to be a pattern of funneling taxpayer dollars through the TVTP program to disparage conservatives. Last year, reports indicated that your Department provided a grant to a University of Dayton program to fight “domestic violent extremism and hate movements.” The year prior to the grant award, the university’s Human Rights Center—which runs the program—hosted a seminar during which the Christian Broadcasting Network, the National Rifle Association, Fox News, and other mainstream conservative organizations were included in a “pyramid of far-right radicalization” with neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Your Department gave the University of Dayton program more than $350,000.
This amounts to the use of government funds to further President Biden’s political agenda. Such an allegation would have been inconceivable four years ago, but you have consistently weaponized the Department against conservatives through the creation of the Disinformation Governance Board and the so-called Homeland Intelligence Experts Group, which includes John Brennan, James Clapper, and others who tried to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. Your Department has also coordinated with Big Tech companies to censor conservative views—as the Fifth Circuit has found in Missouri v. Biden. Now, we are learning that the Biden Administration has been outsourcing so-called counter-propaganda to private liberal entities. You should claw back all funds provided to entities to combat so-called misinformation and ensure this never happens again.
In addition, please provide the following information by January 31, 2024:
How many other grants has the Department approved to private entities to create propaganda?
Who participated in approving this grant and will you hold them accountable?
What other similar entities have received funding under the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Crack Down on Human Trafficking by Empowering Victims
Date: Tuesday, January 16, 2024

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)
introduced bipartisan legislation
to hold human traffickers accountable by giving victims their day in court.
“Human trafficking survivors deserve justice, not forced arbitration,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This legislation puts power in the hands of survivors and gives them the power to hold human traffickers accountable.”
“Forcing victims of modern-day slavery into a rigged arbitration system deprives them of one of the most powerful tools they have to hold their traffickers accountable: access to justice,”
Senator Blumenthal said.
“This narrowly crafted and bipartisan legislation will make human traffickers pay for their crimes.”
Under current law, traffickers shield themselves from accountability through coercive loopholes in employment contracts that effectively force victims to relinquish their legal remedies available under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
These forced arbitration clauses, as they are known, prevent victims from having their day in court while allowing traffickers to escape legal responsibility. Many forced arbitration clauses also include a confidentiality requirement—which prevents perpetrators from being held publicly accountable—as well as a provision barring survivors from joining together in class action lawsuits against traffickers.
Empowering survivors by cracking down on forced arbitration will help break the dangerous cycle of human trafficking crimes too often committed by repeated offenders.
“Forcing survivors into arbitration for trafficking claims denies access to justice and hides traffickers from public accountability. Survivors deserve to have their claims heard by a judge and jury and the chance to receive full payment for the work they performed and the exploitation they endured. The public deserves to know if companies in their communities and supply chains are exploiting their workers. This small change will create a huge impact for trafficking survivors in the US,”
said Jean Bruggeman, Executive Director of Freedom Network USA.
“We hope to see Congress listen to survivors and pass this bill without delay.”
“Victims and survivors of trafficking are regularly forced into silence through their traffickers’ threats, intimidation, abuse and deprivation. Mandatory arbitration creates yet another barrier to their ability to seek justice for these abuses, and allows exploiters to escape legal consequences for their actions,”
said
Catherine Chen, CEO, Polaris.
“Polaris supports The Ending Forced Arbitration of Human Trafficking Act to eliminate this loophole and ensure victims and survivors get the justice they deserve.”
“Forced arbitration thwarts trafficking survivors’ efforts to seek justice. These arbitration clauses prevent trafficking survivors from filing lawsuits that would provide vindication — and financial damages. Instead, trafficking survivors must submit to a forum that is expensive, secretive, and rigged against them,”
said Martina Vandenberg, President of the Human Trafficking Legal Center.
“Forced arbitration has become a weapon to hold workers in forced labor, preventing them from leaving their abusive situations. This cannot continue. Forced arbitration in sex trafficking and forced labor cases must end.”
“We’ve seen the effects of human trafficking and understand the devastating harm it creates. Seeking justice through federal litigation may provide meaningful relief for survivors by bringing their claims to light, allowing access to important procedures that level the playing field, and providing a deterrent effect for employers who traffic,”
said Keeli Sorensen, Director of Policy and Government Affairs at Justice in Motion.
“This bill will protect vulnerable workers and give survivors access to the fair and transparent process they so richly deserve.”
“Like victims of sexual harassment and assault, victims of human trafficking must not be subjected to forced arbitration in disputes alleging conduct related to or constituting human trafficking. Therefore, I strongly support Senator Blumenthal and Hawley’s bill to amend Chapter 4 of title 9, United States Code, to ban arbitration of disputes involving human trafficking,”
said Kirsten Foot, PhD, CEO & Executive Director of Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking.
“Human trafficking victims include those who have been compelled to provide labor or sex acts through force, fraud, and/or coercion. They should not have to risk further exploitation through forced arbitration. The proposed amendment will protect victims of human trafficking and empower them to pursue the forms of justice and outcomes that are best for them.”

Title: Hawley Slams Biden Admin for Prioritizing its Radical, Pro-China Climate Agenda over American Workers
Date: Thursday, January 11, 2024

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called out
the Biden Administration over its hyper-fixation on a radical climate agenda that is propping up China’s manufacturers on the backs of American workers. During an Energy Committee hearing, Senator Hawley questioned U.S. Department of Energy Deputy Secretary David Turk about the Administration’s policies and advocated for the nation’s autoworkers, including those at the
General Motors plant in Wentzville, Mo., who fought for fair wages amid the recent United Auto Workers (UAW) strike.
“Why is it good for the American worker that we force our supply chains to a country that’s our greatest rival and adversary, and why is it good for the American consumer?”
Senator Hawley asked.
Senator Hawley also raised concerns that foreign countries may soon take over America’s industrial base due to the Biden’s Administration’s radical electric vehicle mandates.
“My nightmare scenario is that we repeat—because of this Administration’s climate agenda, climate fixation, I would argue—we repeat and hyper-charge the loss of industry we saw in the ’70s, and the ’80s, and the ’90s, and we do it all over again,”
continued Senator Hawley,
“and, so, the remaining few things that we actually produce in this country, like automobiles, we won’t produce anymore.”

How are we going to make sure […] they are able to vindicate their rights? Because they do have rights, and they should have rights.”
Senator Hawley also raised concerns over growing deepfake technology that can manipulate users’ data, arguing that Americans should be able to protect their image and likeness online.
“I just think the idea that at any moment you live in the fear that some image of me out there could be manipulated and turned into something completely else, ruin my reputation—and what’s your alternative? Go file a legal suit? […] Most people don’t have money for that.”

Title: Senators Hawley, Vance, Rubio Urge CFIUS to Block Sale of U.S. Steel & Protect America’s Industrial Base
Date: Wednesday, December 20, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)
sent a letter
to Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury and Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), urging her to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan-based Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC). NSC announced plans to acquire U.S. Steel on Monday, a deal that raises national security concerns and threatens to weaken America’s industrial base.
“The transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind. When U.S. Steel announced its “review of strategic alternatives” in August, it pledged to adopt a “measured approach.” But the board’s fiduciary duty was to its shareholders, and U.S. Steel has admitted that the very reason for the sale was its desire to “maximiz[e] value for [. . .] stockholders.” The transaction was not the product of careful deliberation over stakeholder interests, but rather the result of an auction to maximize shareholder returns,”
wrote the Senators.
They continued,
“Trade protections can and should induce foreign investment that expands domestic production and creates American jobs. This corporate takeover is out of step with those goals. Allowing foreign companies to buy out American companies and enjoy our trade protections subverts the very purpose for which those protections were put in place.”
“The Committee cannot rebalance American trade or reshape its corporate governance, but it can mitigate some of the worst consequences of both. It can and should block the acquisition of U.S. Steel by NSC, a company whose allegiances clearly lie with a foreign state and whose record in the United States is deeply flawed,”
the Senators concluded.

December 19, 2023
The Hon. Janet Yellen
Secretary
U.S. Treasury Department
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Secretary Yellen:
We write to you in your capacity as Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to express my concern about the acquisition of the United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”) by Japan’s Nippon Steel Corporation (“NSC”). The transaction marks a turning point for an icon of American industry and has dire implications for the industrial base of the United States.
The transaction was not entered into with U.S. national security in mind. When U.S. Steel announced its “review of strategic alternatives” in August, it pledged to adopt a “measured approach.” But the board’s fiduciary duty was to its shareholders, and U.S. Steel has admitted that the very reason for the sale was its desire to “maximiz[e] value for . . . stockholders.” The transaction was not the product of careful deliberation over stakeholder interests, but rather the result of an auction to maximize shareholder returns. The joint press release announcing the all-cash transaction led off with a declaration about the transaction’s “certain and immediate value to U.S. Steel shareholders.”
Despite the absence of any security-focused deliberation on U.S. Steel’s part, domestic steel production is vital to U.S. national security. Democratic and Republican administrations have both acted decisively over the last forty years to bolster the industry. The endurance of President Trump’s Section 232 tariffs on steel imports demonstrates that the preservation of the domestic steel industry remains vital to our national security. Trade protections can and should induce foreign investment that expands domestic production and creates American jobs. This corporate takeover is out of step with those goals. Allowing foreign companies to buy out American companies and enjoy our trade protections subverts the very purpose for which those protections were put in place.
The problems with this transaction run even deeper than that, however. NSC does not share U.S. Steel’s storied connection to the United States, and its financial interests are tied into those of Japan. Earlier this year, NSC received more than $3 billion in subsidies from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. And NSC has even flouted American trade law. As recently as August 2021, NSC was found guilty of unlawfully dumping flat-rolled steel products into the U.S. market.
This acquisition is not occurring in a vacuum. The United States has run a trade deficit for nearly half a century. Our cumulative trade debt now stands at more than $14 trillion. Over the last five years, we have run an average annual trade deficit of more than $65 billion with Japan alone. One of the promised benefits of such unbalanced trade is that we run a capital account surplus: we import the world’s goods, and they consume our financial assets in return. In theory that may sound fine. But issues become apparent when those financial assets include critical pieces of the American industrial base.
The Committee cannot rebalance American trade or reshape its corporate governance, but it can mitigate some of the worst consequences of both. It can and should block the acquisition of U.S. Steel by NSC, a company whose allegiances clearly lie with a foreign state and whose record in the United States is deeply flawed. We urge the Committee to initiate a review of the transaction unilaterally, particularly in light of the fact that U.S. Steel received competitive bids from American companies who would not pose the same risks.
Thank you for your efforts to safeguard American national security.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Holds Nominees, Calls for Further Evaluation of McConnell Nominees
Date: Wednesday, December 20, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), citing concerns about two of his recommended nominees. Senator Hawley appended questions to his letter for the nominees to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to answer regarding their policy views on several issues, including Big Tech and rail safety. Senator Hawley is currently holding both nominees.
Senator Hawley’s letter comes as the Senate looks to pass a negotiated nominations package, likely to include dozens of Democrat-recommended nominees and only a few Republican appointees.
“If Republicans are planning to install dozens of Biden nominees for positions across the federal government—without a vote—in exchange for just a handful of our own selections, I want to be sure that we get our nominees right,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“For example, Andrew Ferguson, nominated to be a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), should answer additional questions on his philosophy concerning Big Tech, given the importance of that issue to our Conference. I also believe that Todd Inman, who is under consideration for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), should be asked to further articulate his views on various transportation policies, including rail safety and autonomous vehicles.”

or below.
December 20, 2023
The Honorable Mitch McConnell
Minority Leader
U.S. Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Leader McConnell:
I write today regarding the expected year-end nominations package and my specific concerns with two of your own recommended nominees.
The expected nominations package will likely include dozens of nominees that have been recommended by Senate Democrats. Many of these Biden nominees will no doubt advance policies and values antithetical to those held by members of the Republican Conference. By agreeing to such a negotiated package in exchange for just a few Republican appointees you have personally deemed a priority, I believe we risk giving away too much.
In particular, two of the nominees you have sought to include in this package need more time for careful evaluation by our own Conference, especially by non-Committee members. If Republicans are planning to install dozens of Biden nominees for positions across the federal government—without a vote—in exchange for just a handful of our own selections, I want to be sure that we get our nominees right. For example, Andrew Ferguson, nominated to be a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), should answer additional questions on his philosophy concerning Big Tech, given the importance of that issue to our Conference. I also believe that Todd Inman, who is under consideration for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), should be asked to further articulate his views on various transportation policies, including rail safety and autonomous vehicles.
I have appended written questions below that I have for each of these two nominees. As you are aware, I am currently withholding my consent for these nominees to be confirmed without a floor vote—as is any senator’s right to do—until I and others can evaluate satisfactory responses to these important policy questions.
I would like to meet with the nominees to discuss these questions.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Army Delivers Funding for Family Housing at Fort Leonard Wood Following Commitment to Senator Hawley
Date: Wednesday, December 20, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced that the Army has now delivered $41.49 million for new family housing at Fort Leonard Wood. This follows Senator Hawley’s repeated demands that overdue investment in families’ homes be made and a commitment by the Army to deliver these funds.
“Fort Leonard Wood’s military families lead a life of service and deserve homes that meet their basic needs. I’m glad to see the Army finally delivering on their promise to replace all aging homes on the base. I urge the Army to ensure that the additional $50 million in promised funding for FY2024 is delivered on time,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley has long advocated for improved family housing at Fort Leonard Wood and has pressed the Army to deliver on its pledge to replace all military housing on the base.
In December 2022, Senator Hawley
announced the Army had committed to
spending $41.4 million in FY2023 and another $50 million in FY2024 for new housing at Fort Leonard Wood. Senator Hawley sent letters to the Secretary of the Army in
March
and
October
demanding that the Army meet its own deadline in delivering $41.4 million to Fort Leonard Wood by the end of FY2023. The Army’s response to commit to $41.49 million by the end of this calendar year—slightly more than its initial $41.4 million pledge—will provide service members at the base with the quality housing they deserve.

Title: Hawley’s Bipartisan AI Bill to Empower Parents to Hold Big Tech Accountable Blocked on Senate Floor
Date: Wednesday, December 13, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate Floor and called for unanimous consent to pass his bill, the
No Section 230 Immunity for AI Act. This legislation would clarify that Section 230 immunity does not apply to claims related to generative AI, ensuring consumers have the tools they need to protect themselves from harmful content produced by the latest advancements in AI technology.
“We have seen what [Big Tech companies] do with their subsidy from government when it comes to social media […] [Big Tech companies] censor the living daylights out of anybody they don’t like […] This government protects [Big Tech],”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “[This bill] just says that these huge companies can be liable like any other company—no special protections from government […] It just breaks up the Big Government, Big Tech cartel. That’s all it does, and it says parents can go into court, same terms as anybody else, and make their case.”

Senators Hawley and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – the Ranking Member and the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, respectively –
introduced the
No Section 230 Immunity for AI Act
in June to put power in the hands of consumers and give Americans impacted by nascent AI technology their day in court to hold Big Tech companies accountable.
Senator Hawley also previously announced
five guiding principles for the future
of AI legislation.
Senator Hawley’s call to unanimously pass the bill was objected to by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

Title: Senator Hawley Forces Procedural Vote to Delay NDAA & Shares Stories of Nuclear Radiation Victims Betrayed by Congressional Leadership
Date: Tuesday, December 12, 2023

Content:
Today on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
shared stories from victims
of government-caused radiation poisoning, after
Congressional leadership stripped reauthorization
of the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) from the FY ’24
National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA). Senator Hawley called for a motion that would have extended debate on the NDAA and delayed its final passage in the Senate.
The RECA program—
which is set to expire in the coming months
—compensates victims poisoned by the federal government through nuclear waste. A reauthorized and updated program would include numerous residents of the greater St. Louis area. Despite
passing the Senate with strong bipartisan support
and
receiving an endorsement
from President Biden, dealmakers scrubbed RECA reauthorization from the defense bill behind closed doors.
“When the government causes injury, the government should make it right. […] That’s what the radiation compensation program does—and it’s wrong to let it expire,”
said Senator Hawley.
[…] It is a scar on the conscience of this body and of this nation. And I will come to the floor as long as it takes until we do right by these Americans who have done right by their country because they deserve better than this.”
“I realize my colleagues are all too eager to move on, but I think it is important we take as much time as is necessary to understand the stakes of what we are doing and to understand the stakes of turning our backs on these people,”
he concluded.

delivered remarks on the Senate floor, vowing to oppose the NDAA and slow down its passage. The Senate also voted on an extra procedural motion last Thursday after Senator Hawley

Title: “Grave Injustice:” Hawley Slams Congressional Leadership for Betraying Nuclear Radiation Victims & Stripping Compensation from NDAA
Date: Thursday, December 07, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
delivered remarks
on the Senate floor after
Congressional leadership betrayed
American nuclear program victims through backroom negotiations. Dealmakers stripped Senator Hawley’s bill to reauthorize the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act
(RECA) from the FY ’24
National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA).
Senator Hawley vowed to oppose the final bill and slow down its passage. The Senate voted on an extra procedural motion today after Senator Hawley
threw up a roadblock.
The RECA program—
which is set to expire in the coming months
—compensates victims poisoned by the federal government through nuclear waste. This includes numerous residents of the greater St. Louis area and across the country. Despite
passing the Senate with strong bipartisan support
and
receiving an endorsement
from President Biden, RECA reauthorization was scrubbed from the bill behind closed doors.
“This is a grave injustice. […] This [NDAA] turns its back on the people of the United States in defense of the lobbyists, and the suits, and the corporate entities who are going to get paid,”
said Senator Hawley.
“To the people of this nation—tens of thousands who have depended on this compensation, life-saving help, who are now at risk of losing all of it—this fight is not over. […] I will come to this floor as long as it takes […] until we compensate the people of this nation, who have sacrificed for this nation, and do not leave them behind,”
he concluded.

Title: Hawley Introduces New Legislation to Justly Compensate Landowners & Stop Federal Confiscation of Farmland
Date: Wednesday, December 06, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Just Compensation Act of 2023
to prevent the federal government and private companies from confiscating Missourians’ property without just compensation.
“Missouri farmers work tirelessly to keep our state, and country, fed. The last thing they should have to deal with is big corporations and the federal government coming to try and take their land,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Congress must make it a priority to protect Missouri landowners and their property rights.”
This legislation follows Senator Hawley’s defense of farmers affected by the Grain Belt Express construction campaign. Last month, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Invenergy CEO Michael Polsky, demanding the company make commitments to operate in good faith and adequately compensate landowners impacted by the proposed transmission line.
Senator Hawley’s
Just Compensation Act of 2023
would:
Prohibit the federal government from delegating the power to exercise eminent domain to any private entity;
Require the federal government to provide just compensation of 150 percent fair market value when exercising eminent domain; and
Impose annual reporting requirements on the Attorney General.

Title: “Major Betrayal:” Hawley Statement After Compensation for Victims of Government Poisoning Stripped from Defense Bill
Date: Wednesday, December 06, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released
the following statement
after his legislation to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was stripped from the FY ’24 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The proposal would have compensated victims who have been poisoned by their government through nuclear waste, including those in the greater St. Louis area.
Without Congressional action,
the entire RECA program will expire
in the coming months and leave victims without support. The provision was removed despite
passing the Senate with strong bipartisan support
and
receiving an endorsement from President Biden.
I am told RECA renewal is NOT in the final defense bill. The backroom dealmakers took it out – even after the big bipartisan vote in the Senate. This is a major betrayal of thousands and thousands of Missourians who have been lied to and ignored for years
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
December 6, 2023
It is also a betrayal of the tens of thousands of Americans made sick by their government’s nuclear waste who have relied on this program for life-saving help. They are now left to fend for themselves as the program expires

December 6, 2023
As I promised, I will vote against this bill that betrays the commitment this nation made to nuclear test victims – and do everything in my power to stop it

Title: Hawley Slams Director Wray on FBI’s Targeting of Catholic Americans as ‘Violent Extremists’
Date: Tuesday, December 05, 2023

Content:
Today in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray on the FBI’s targeting of traditionalist Catholics. Senator Hawley discussed
a report
issued by the House Judiciary Committee revealing a memo outlining the weaponization of the FBI against Catholics, and repeatedly demanded that Director Wray hold accountable the individuals involved.
“Now we know that in fact, FBI agents did approach a priest and a choir director to ask them to inform on parishioners […] Good heavens, Director, this is one of the most outrageous targetings – you have mobilized your division, the most powerful law enforcement division in the world, against traditionalist Catholics,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “your memo labels traditional Catholics as racially, and ethnically, motivated violent extremists in need of investigation […] You have repeatedly said ‘we don’t target churches, we don’t list churches,’ [but] they’re listed in the memo.”
Senator Hawley has previously
called on
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for answers on the FBI’s targeting and subsequent arrests of people of faith, particularly Catholics.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Don’t Let Government Get Away With Poisoning Americans
Date: Monday, December 04, 2023

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Dec. 4, 2023 |
Real Clear Politics
This year, Americans had the opportunity to revisit the origins of our nation’s nuclear program with the blockbuster film “Oppenheimer.” But there’s one story line that didn’t make the big screen: those Americans who are still paying the price.
For decades, the federal government poisoned an untold number of its citizens through our atomic program. It happened everywhere, impacting uranium mine workers in Texas, Native Americans living downwind from nuclear tests in the Mountain West, and communities exposed to Manhattan Project waste in Missouri. And that’s just a small sample.
[…]
Now, the law that delivers some justice and compensation to these victims is about to expire. Congress must include a reauthorization of this life-changing program as part of the annual defense bill. It’s our chance to give justice to victims who have been silenced and forgotten for years.
[…]
Tens of thousands of American workers across the country helped to mine and process uranium and worked in facilities that built our atomic weapons, and they breathed in the toxic substances every day.
[…]
In 1990, Congress finally acknowledged the government’s egregious neglect and passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to compensate victims who were sickened with cancer from nuclear tests.
[…]
But in just a few months, funding for the program will be cut off. This cannot be allowed to happen. Since its creation, RECA has helped tens of thousands of Americans and assisted those exposed to radiation rebuild and renew their lives. How can we turn our back on them?
Many more communities still need access to this program before it runs out. In my home state of Missouri, mismanaged nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project era sat exposed for years and contaminated communities in the St. Louis region – and now these areas have elevated cancer rates. In multiple other states, “downwinders” still need compensation.
[…]
Back in July, Congress took the first step to getting this done when the Senate adopted, as part of the defense bill, my amendment with Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico to extend and strengthen the RECA program. I was proud to see that amendment pass with a bipartisan supermajority, reflecting the broad support among both parties for obtaining justice for victims. President Biden has since supported it as well.
House and Senate leadership must not strip this life-changing program from the final defense bill. It would amount to a slap in the face to victims everywhere if our leaders in Congress decide to kneecap the Americans who suffered from these nuclear programs and instead ship billions and billions to defense contractors or foreign wars. There’s no excuse for forgetting about the people we serve.
When the government poisons its own people, it must make it right. We have no other choice.

calling on Congress to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in the FY ’24 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to compensate victims of government-caused radiation in the greater St. Louis area. If Congress does not act, the entire existing RECA program that provides support for victims of radiation around the country will expire in a few months. Senator Hawley has
pledged to oppose the NDAA
if it does not include compensation for Missouri victims.
Americans poisoned by our government’s nuclear tests & waste are set to lose the lifesaving help they’ve relied on for over 30 years. RECA must be reauthorized in this NDAA before it expires in just a few months. Thousands of radiation victims depend on this program to survive
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
December 1, 2023
This past Tuesday, Senator Hawley
welcomed Missouri grassroots advocates
impacted by federal government-caused nuclear waste to the U.S. Capitol, so Washington leadership could hear their stories.
Background:
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community and all Missourians impacted by government-caused nuclear contamination.
On July 27, 2023, in a
strong bipartisan vote, Senator Hawley
secured passage
of an amendment to the FY 2024 NDAA that would provide compensation to victims of government-caused nuclear contamination. The legislation extends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover victims of improperly-stored nuclear waste in affected areas in the St. Louis region. The measure—which was cosponsored by U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.)—also reauthorized and strengthened the RECA program to cover more impacted Americans from nuclear tests along with uranium miners. President Biden has
endorsed the legislation.

Title: Hawley Introduces New Legislation to Protect Livestock Producers & Tackle Rising Costs
Date: Thursday, November 30, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Protecting Interstate Commerce for Livestock Producers Act
to protect farmers from costly regulations – made in other states – that will hurt their business and drive-up costs for consumers.
In 2018, California voters passed Proposition 12 which would ban the sale of pork, eggs, and calves for veal that were not produced with certain space requirements. It is estimated that California accounts for 13 percent of all pork consumption in the United States. When this law goes into full effect early next year, farmers across the country – including in Missouri – will have to comply with California’s preferred requirements to access the California market.
“Missouri’s livestock producers keep food on the table across America and they shouldn’t be burdened by costly laws – made by other states – that disrupt interstate commerce, drive-up costs, and impose crippling regulations,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This law is a commonsense solution to protect family farms from going bankrupt and consumers from shouldering higher costs at the grocery store.”
To ensure that no state can mandate animal welfare standards in another state, Senator Hawley’s
Protecting Interstate Commerce for Livestock Producers
Act
:
Preempts states and local governments from regulating the raising, production, and importation of livestock or livestock-derived goods from another state or local government;
Allows states to regulate the importation of livestock in the event of animal disease; and
Protects farmers from states implementing laws that are preempted by this bill.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) welcomed Missouri grassroots advocates impacted by federal government-caused nuclear waste to the U.S. Capitol. He
repeated his pledge
to oppose and hold up the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) if it does not include compensation for the victims of decades-old radiation in the greater St. Louis area.
“If this emerges from a back room, and this provision is out, the defense bill is going to face tough sledding on the floor of the Senate. […] I am not going to vote to pay defense contractors hand over fist while the people of my state—and, frankly, across the country—are denied the compensation that they’re due,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“I don’t quite understand how it is that we may not have money available to compensate radiation victims in the state of Missouri—who have the highest rates of cancer in the nation—but we have
unlimited funding for Ukraine.”

Title: Hawley Resolution Honors U.S. Marine Corps Captain Samuel Farmer, Marines and Sailors of His Platoon
Date: Wednesday, November 15, 2023

Content:
Yesterday U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
delivered remarks
on the Senate floor recognizing the
passage of his resolution
honoring the heroism and sacrifice of United States Marine Corps Captain Samuel Farmer of Missouri and the Marines and Sailors he commanded as part of First Platoon, Company G, Second Battalion, First Marine Regiment.
During the height of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, then-First Lieutenant Farmer and his platoon were stationed at Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) in Kabul, facilitating the evacuation of American citizens, permanent residents, embassy workers, and special immigrant visa holders as the region rapidly fell to the Taliban. On August 26, 2021, an Islamic State terrorist detonated a suicide bomb at Abbey Gate, killing 13 American service members – including nine from Captain Farmer’s platoon – and injuring many more, including Farmer.
“Whatever you think of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, we should be able to honor the men and women who served so bravely – including Sam Farmer and the members of his platoon,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This young man from Missouri, who represents, frankly, the best of who we are and who we can be. And so, Mr. President, it’s a privilege to get to honor Sam, to congratulate him on his service to our country.”

Title: Hawley Urges Relief for Missionaries Harmed by State Department Rule
Date: Wednesday, November 15, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Assistant Secretary Rena Bitter of the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department. Senator Hawley urged Assistant Secretary Bitter to provide relief to religious workers, including a Christian missionary employed in Missouri, who are being harmed by a recent State Department rule that effectively prioritizes illegal immigrants over religious workers in the visa queue.
“It has come to my attention that a recent State Department rule created a massive backlog of employment-based, fourth preference category (EB-4) visas, which is adversely affecting faith-based employers in Missouri,”
said Senator Hawley.
” Concerningly, the Biden Administration seems to have pushed Christian missionaries to the back of the visa line—and allowed illegal aliens to cut ahead of them. It is incumbent upon your agency to provide relief to my constituents and religious organizations across the country who stand to be greatly harmed by this abrupt change in policy.”
He continued,
“The present obstacles that religious organizations face are unacceptable. Sadly, it appears that religious workers are collateral damage in the Biden Administration’s push to expand ‘lawful pathways’ for individuals who crossed the southern border illegally. […] Therefore, I urge you to redress the harms to religious workers generated by your agency’s rule, including by advancing the priority date for religious workers.”

Dear Assistant Secretary Bitter,
It has come to my attention that a recent State Department rule created a massive backlog of employment-based, fourth preference category (EB-4) visas, which is adversely affecting faith-based employers in Missouri. As a direct result of this rule, a missionary employed in my state will be forced to leave her family and wait abroad—for potentially more than a decade—until her visa is processed. Concerningly, the Biden Administration seems to have pushed Christian missionaries to the back of the visa line—and allowed illegal aliens to cut ahead of them. It is incumbent upon your agency to provide relief to my constituents and religious organizations across the country who stand to be greatly harmed by this abrupt change in policy.
In March 2023, the State Department determined that it would no longer prorate EB-4 visa allocation to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, reversing the agency’s interpretation which had stood for nearly seven years. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, there were 105,267 approved petitions awaiting EB-4 visa availability as of March 2023, including 84,168 petitions from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—most of which are for unaccompanied youth. By contrast, only 866 such petitions were outstanding for religious workers. Almost instantly, the Department’s rule added tens of thousands of petitions to the waiting list for EB-4 visas and thus created a lengthy backlog for such visas.
My office has been contacted by a religious non-profit in Missouri that is directly harmed by this action. The non-profit employs a missionary who is currently working on a temporary R-1 visa, which expires in January 2024. Though USCIS has approved her I-360 petition, she will be forced to leave the country when her R-1 visa expires and could wait more than a decade for her visa eligibility in the now-enormous queue of EB-4 visas. But for the State Department’s action, she may not have had to wait at all.
The present obstacles that religious organizations face are unacceptable. Sadly, it appears that religious workers are collateral damage in the Biden Administration’s push to expand “lawful pathways” for individuals who crossed the southern border illegally. Indeed, the State Department’s own announcement states that religious workers and other EB-4 applicants “should expect to wait longer for a visa to become available…while applicants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras…should expect a shorter wait time.” In any case, this is a problem of your agency’s own making, and you bear responsibility for religious workers, like the missionary in my state, who are harmed by it.
Therefore, I urge you to redress the harms to religious workers generated by your agency’s rule, including by advancing the priority date for religious workers. Please respond to this letter by providing the specific actions your agency will take to expeditiously fix this situation.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Demands Invenergy Compensate Missouri Landowners Affected by Grain Belt Express and Tiger Connector Construction Project
Date: Wednesday, November 15, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Invenergy CEO Michael Polsky, standing up for Missouri farmers and demanding the company make commitments to operate in good faith, as well as adequately compensate landowners affected by the Grain Belt Express construction campaign. Senator Hawley’s letter follows the Missouri Public Service Commission’s
decision
last month to approve the Tiger Connector amendment to the Grain Belt Express Line Project.
“Your company’s Grain Belt Express construction campaign has hurt Missouri’s farmers,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“They have lost the use of arable land, seen their property values decline, and been forced to operate under a cloud of uncertainty as your company vacillates over the full scope of the project.”
He continued,
“There is a clear remedy for these harms: as a gesture of goodwill, your company should commit to following all of the requirements passed in House Bill 2005 for the construction of the Tiger Connector Line. Additionally, your company should retroactively compensate landowners whose land was originally taken for the Grain Belt Express project at the new 150% rate. Your company should also commit to compensating farmers for any ongoing losses sustained as a result of your company’s construction and maintenance of both the Grain Belt Express and Tiger Connector.”

Mr. Michael Polsky
Chief Executive Officer
Invenergy
One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1800
Chicago, Illinois 60646
Dear Mr. Polsky:
Your company’s Grain Belt Express construction campaign has hurt Missouri’s farmers. They have lost the use of arable land, seen their property values decline, and been forced to operate under a cloud of uncertainty as your company vacillates over the full scope of the project. To name just a few examples, since the Grain Belt Express was originally proposed, the completion timetable, the total capacity of the line, the ultimate corporate parent, the amount of power to be delivered, the location of the Missouri converter station, and the full range of connections required have all changed.
This is not an acceptable status quo. In fact, public backlash against your company’s actions was so severe that last year Missouri passed a new law to fix this. House Bill 2005 guarantees that landowners whose property is seized for future projects must be compensated at 150% of market value and requires that a proportional amount of power from the line is given to the State. Unfortunately, those new protections come too late for the farmers whose land has already been taken. And to add insult to injury, your company has now gained approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission to add the Tiger Connector line to the approved Grain Belt Express project, bypassing the requirements in House Bill 2005.
Given this track record, it is far from clear why any Missouri farmers should assume that your company is operating in good faith. There is a clear remedy for these harms: as a gesture of goodwill, your company should commit to following all of the requirements passed in House Bill 2005 for the construction of the Tiger Connector Line. Additionally, your company should retroactively compensate landowners whose land was originally taken for the Grain Belt Express project at the new 150% rate. Your company should also commit to compensating farmers for any ongoing losses sustained as a result of your company’s construction and maintenance of both the Grain Belt Express and Tiger Connector.
No doubt such commitments will prove costly to your company. But at this point, only concrete commitments will make up for the frustration and grief Missouri farmers have already suffered. You owe them that.
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Calls on Yellen to Protect Missouri Union Jobs, Modify Terms of Yellow Corporation’s Loans
Date: Thursday, November 09, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, urging her to seek authority to extend the repayment terms of Yellow Corporation’s outstanding CARES Act loans, in an effort to allow the company to obtain a buyer and preserve union jobs for hundreds of Missouri workers.
“After years of mismanagement, this once-venerable trucking company filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, jeopardizing tens of thousands of positions—including about 750 union jobs in my home state of Missouri,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“I urge you to seek the authority to modify the maturity date of Yellow’s outstanding CARES Act loans, pushing this date back to 2026.”
He continued,
“A modification of the repayment terms will allow Yellow to obtain a buyer who will keep its assets together as a going concern—that is, keep it in business as a player in the trucking sector. Reports indicate that such a potential buyer has already emerged. Facilitating such a sale, by making Yellow’s loan repayment terms more flexible, is a commonsense step to keep Yellow’s trucks on the road, and keep its workforce gainfully employed. American workers deserve that support.

The Hon. Janet Yellen
Secretary of the Treasury
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Secretary Yellen:
Executives, not employees, are responsible for corporate failures. American working people shouldn’t, as far as possible, suffer the brunt of bad strategic decisions. But unfortunately, that’s exactly what’s happening at Yellow Corporation. After years of mismanagement, this once-venerable trucking company filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, jeopardizing tens of thousands of positions—including about 750 union jobs in my home state of Missouri.
Now, the company is at risk of being effectively sold for parts, with its facilities being sold to one buyer and its fleet of movable assets being sold to another. If that happens, Yellow’s employees won’t only lose their jobs—which would be bad enough. These workers will also lose a significant portion of their earned benefits, such as accrued vacation time, sick pay, insurance contributions, pensions, and so on. Despite years of faithful service, they will be given the short straw.
But it doesn’t need to be this way. The most significant financial pressure facing Yellow—and what is catalyzing this fire sale—is Yellow’s outstanding loan under the CARES Act, which comes due in 2024. You have the power to change that. I urge you to seek the authority to modify the maturity date of Yellow’s outstanding CARES Act loans, pushing this date back to 2026. As you know, the Treasury Department has done so on prior occasions, such as during the 2008 financial crisis, where circumstances proved appropriate.
A modification of the repayment terms will allow Yellow to obtain a buyer who will keep its assets together as a going concern—that is, keep it in business as a player in the trucking sector. Reports indicate that such a potential buyer has already emerged. Facilitating such a sale, by making Yellow’s loan repayment terms more flexible, is a commonsense step to keep Yellow’s trucks on the road, and keep its workforce gainfully employed. American workers deserve that support.
Thank you for your consideration.

Title: Hawley Demands Investigation into Biden DHS Agents Pulled from Child Exploitation Cases After Additional Whistleblower Claims
Date: Thursday, November 09, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, demanding an
investigation
into whistleblower allegations that the Biden DHS has reassigned hundreds of special agents charged with important investigations to menial tasks at the southern border – including handing out sandwiches to illegal immigrants.
The letter follows Senator Hawley’s questioning of
DHS Secretary Mayorkas’ testimony
in last week’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing about whistleblower allegations. Following the hearing, several additional whistleblowers contacted Senator Hawley and provided additional details about special agents being reassigned.
“Most concerningly, all the whistleblowers allege that important criminal investigations stalled and suspects were not arrested or indicted as a result of these reassignments,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Agents were pulled from investigations ranging from child exploitation to drug trafficking to counterterrorism. One whistleblower was pulled from child exploitation cases ‘that haunt your soul when you aren’t available and able to ensure the children involved aren’t being abused.'”
He continued,
“The Department’s decision to relegate its highly-trained criminal investigators to processing and feeding illegal immigrants, rather than investigating child exploitation cases, is bad policy. But it also may be illegal and in violation of existing regulations.”

or below.
November 8, 2023
The Honorable Joseph V. Cuffari
Office of Inspector General
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
245 Murray Lane SW
Washington, DC 20528Dear Inspector General Cuffari,
I write to request an immediate investigation into whistleblower allegations that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has shut down or delayed investigations into child exploitation and other crimes in order to transfer hundreds of special agents to process illegal immigrants at the southern border. No fewer than four separate DHS whistleblowers have contacted my office alleging a severe mismanagement of staffing and resources at the direction of senior officials within DHS, allegations which may demonstrate a violation of law. These allegations merit an immediate investigation.
On October 31, 2023, I questioned Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) regarding whistleblower allegations that he removed 600 Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agents from felony investigations to facilitate immigration processing functions at the southern border. According to the whistleblower, agents “are being told to shut down investigations to hand out sandwiches and escort migrants to the shower.” This led to child exploitation suspects and fentanyl dealers evading indictment, including child molesters. When asked whether special agents had been pulled away from cases and reassigned to the border, Secretary Mayorkas testified, “Combatting the fight against fentanyl, yes.”
Following the hearing, three more whistleblowers from across the country contacted my office, corroborating these claims. One alleged that Secretary Mayorkas was “absolutely lying” and that agents were not, in fact, being reassigned to investigate fentanyl cases. The whistleblower corroborated the claim that there have been at least 600 agents at a given time reassigned to the border. A third whistleblower claims that he was also reassigned to the border to “babysit” illegal immigrants; his duties included holding doors for private contractors who prepared the sandwiches for illegal immigrants, who were “fed better than my kids.” A fourth whistleblower confirmed that special agents had been pulled off child exploitation investigations. According to some of the whistleblowers, much of their time was spent on “stand-by,” as offices at the border were not expecting their arrival.
Most concerningly, all the whistleblowers allege that important criminal investigations stalled and suspects were not arrested or indicted as a result of these reassignments. Agents were pulled from investigations ranging from child exploitation to drug trafficking to counterterrorism. One whistleblower was pulled from child exploitation cases “that haunt your soul when you aren’t available and able to ensure the children involved aren’t being abused.” Another whistleblower alleges that hands-on child molesters were not arrested and further provides specific examples of child exploitation indictments that were delayed or adversely affected due to these reassignments.
These whistleblowers have also provided documentation supporting their claims. For example, documents provided to my office show that HSI supervisors acknowledged the problem of HSI special agents sitting around without being assigned tasks. Additionally, the whistleblowers provided my office with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detail HSI special agents to the southern border. The MOA confirms the whistleblowers’ allegations that their duties would include “[p]hysically observing [migrants] in holding areas,” sitting with migrants at the hospital, and escorting migrants from place to place. Notably, the MOA was signed by the Acting Commissioner of CBP and a senior ICE official in April 2023, though the reassignments allegedly have been occurring for over a year. My office will transmit relevant documents to inform your investigation in a manner that protects the anonymity of whistleblowers.
The Department’s decision to relegate its highly-trained criminal investigators to processing and feeding illegal immigrants, rather than investigating child exploitation cases, is bad policy. But it also may be illegal and in violation of existing regulations. For example, whistleblowers allege that these practices violate 13 U.S.C. § 1301(a) of the Anti-Deficiency Act, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, and internal ICE travel policies. Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, you have the authority to conduct investigations into the programs and operations of DHS. I therefore write to request an immediate investigation into these practices.
The American public deserves transparency and accountability, especially when it concerns the safety and security of our nation and the integrity of our law enforcement agencies. Please include in your investigation answers to the following questions:
1. Since January 2021, how many HSI special agents have been reassigned to the southern border to perform migrant processing functions?
a. How many of these special agents were required to pause or abandon investigations into criminal activity due to their reassignments?
b. How many of the investigations delayed or abandoned because of reassignments involved child exploitation, fentanyl trafficking, or counterterrorism?
c. How is DHS measuring the effectiveness of these reassignments in reducing the number of migrants at the southern border?
2. How many complaints identifying potential waste, fraud, and abuse have DHS officials received as a result of HSI reassignments?
a. Have any whistleblowers been subject to retaliatory action as a result of their complaints?
3. Are HSI special agents able to defer their reassignments in order to continue critical investigations?
4. Did the Department violate any provisions of law or internal policies by reassigning special agents to the border, including but not limited to violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, OMB Circular A-76, or ICE travel policies?
5. Secretary Mayorkas testified to Congress that special agents had been reassigned to the border to combat the fight against fentanyl. Was this statement true?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley’s Renewed Push for TikTok Ban Blocked on Senate Floor Despite Spike in Pro-Hamas Content
Date: Wednesday, November 08, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor and again called for unanimous consent on his bill, the
No TikTok on United States Devices Act, which would prohibit TikTok from operating in the United States and ban commercial activity with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance. The renewed push to ban the app comes amid
the increase in anti-Israel, pro-Hamas content
on the platform.
“TikTok has become a haven for antisemitic content, a haven for propaganda, for genocide. […] As virulent and offensive as this content is, that is not a reason to ban them. The real reason to ban TikTok is that it is a spy app for the Chinese Communist Government,”
said Senator Hawley.

The Honorable Janet Yellen
Secretary
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Secretary Yellen:
TikTok—and its parent company ByteDance—are threats to American national security. The popular video-sharing app harvests vast amounts of data from Americans’ personal devices, data which then flows overseas to our main geopolitical rival. Whistleblower testimony has revealed that China-based employees have full access to U.S. user data. And under Chinese law, ByteDance is required to make that data available to the Chinese Communist Party upon request.
We’ve known all this for years. But the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), which you chair, has not yet concluded its review of the app, or demanded that ByteDance sell off TikTok. Recent developments underscore the need for prompt action.
While data security issues are paramount, less often discussed is TikTok’s power to radically distort the world-picture that America’s young people encounter. Israel’s unfolding war with Hamas is a crucial test case. According to one poll, 51% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 believe that Hamas’s murder of civilians was justified—a statistic notably different from other age cohorts. Analysts have attributed this disparity to the ubiquity of anti-Israel content on TikTok, where most young internet users get their information about the world.
Crucially, this disparity aligns with the Chinese government’s foreign policy preferences. Having previously refused to condemn Hamas, the Chinese government is now calling for a “ceasefire” that would cripple Israel’s ability to defend itself. And we know from past experience that political manipulation is business as usual for TikTok. To take just one example, in 2019, as ByteDance partnered with the Chinese government to surveil Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, TikTok censored American user content critical of this repression. It appears that ByteDance is once again up to its old tricks—as innocent Israelis suffer and die.
This simply heightens the stakes of the TikTok question: the longer this app is allowed to operate in the U.S., the longer its Chinese Communist Party overseers will apparently be able to propagandize Americans. That is unacceptable.
I urge you, and the other members of CFIUS, to swiftly conclude your review and ban all ByteDance-controlled apps currently available to U.S. users. The matter is as simple as that.
I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Questions Facebook Whistleblower on Big Tech’s Rampant Child Exploitation Problems
Date: Tuesday, November 07, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
heard testimony from
Meta Whistleblower Arturo Béjar, the former Director of Engineering for Protect and Care at Facebook. The hearing took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, where Senator Hawley serves as Ranking Member.
During his opening remarks, Senator Hawley called out Big Tech for their extensive lobbying efforts to kill any legislation attempting to regulate the industry.
“Big tech is the biggest, most powerful lobbying in the United States Congress,”
said Senator Hawley.
“They spend millions upon millions upon millions of dollars every year to lobby this body, and the the truth is—as every reporter in this room knows, and I hope you’ll report it after this hearing—they do it successfully. They successfully shut down every meaningful piece of legislation every year.”
He continued,
“It is time for it to be broken, and the only way I know to break it is to bring the truth forward. And that’s why we are so glad Mr. Béjar that you are here today to do it.”

Senator Hawley also questioned Béjar about a 2021 memo that Béjar had written to Facebook executives highlighting the platform’s rampant child protection failures.
“In that memo, you disclosed to them that according to your own research, one in eight children, children now, had experienced unwanted sexual advances within the last seven days,”
said Senator Hawley.
“And about one in three—I think it was 27%—had experienced unwanted sexual advances outside of the seven day window.”
When Senator Hawley asked Béjar about the executives’ responses to his email, Béjar revealed that executives at Facebook, including Mark Zuckerberg himself, ignored his findings. Senator Hawley stressed that change would only come through legal accountability:
“If you want to incentivize changes to these companies, you have got to allow people to sue them. […] And the other thing I’d just say is, on the money—the money that is flowing into this Capitol from Big Tech is obscene, it’s totally obscene—and if we really wanted to change something, we’d get the corporate money out of politics,”
Senator Hawley concluded.

Title: Hawley Urges EPA Clean Up West Lake Landfill Immediately
Date: Thursday, November 02, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
questioned
Bruno Pigott, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Senator Hawley called on the EPA to immediately clean up the radioactive contamination at the West Lake Landfill Superfund Site in Bridgeton, Mo.
“It’s probably no coincidence that the folks who live in this area are not big-time donors to political parties, they’re not big-time party activists, these are working people and they have been taken advantage of for years. And the government, for years, has just expected them to live with it…,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This has got to stop, and we need the EPA to clean this site up.”
Watch the full exchange
here
or below.
Background
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community and all Missourians impacted by government-caused nuclear contamination. Most recently, Senator Hawley
secured President Biden’s endorsement
of his legislation to compensate victims of nuclear radiation exposure.
On July 27, 2023, in a
strong bipartisan vote, Senator Hawley
secured passage
of an amendment to the FY 2024 NDAA that would provide compensation to victims of government-caused nuclear contamination. The legislation extends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover victims of improperly-stored nuclear waste in affected areas in the St. Louis region. The measure—which was cosponsored by U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.)—also reauthorized and strengthened the RECA program to cover more impacted Americans from nuclear tests along with uranium miners.
Earlier in July, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the Department of Energy (DOE), urging additional testing for radioactive contamination at a site in St. Charles County, Mo., after a review of the Weldon Spring site in 2021 offered an extensive critique of the DOE’s cleanup and monitoring efforts there. Senator Hawley also
sent a letter
to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) urging him to convene a committee hearing to discuss the government-caused nuclear contamination of the St. Louis area. In addition, Senator Hawley penned
separate letters
to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), DOE, and EPA, demanding answers from the government about the nuclear contamination.
In April, Senator Hawley’s legislation mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District and radioactive waste testing
passed the U.S. Senate
and Biden’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm also vowed to support it.
Earlier in the year, Senator Hawley
delivered remarks
on the Senate floor,
called out
the Biden Administration for its lack of action, and
pushed
the DOE for answers on the radioactive waste found at the school. Senator Hawley also worked with Congresswoman Cori Bush (D-Mo.)
to send a letter
to USACE, calling for additional radioactive testing of the Hazelwood School District properties after
demanding
last October that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary in light of reported contamination. Following the initial reporting, Senator Hawley
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for impacted students and families.

Title: Hawley Blasts Mayorkas for Pro-Hamas Spokeswoman Still on DHS Payroll
Date: Tuesday, October 31, 2023

Content:
Today in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and slammed the Biden Administration for their employment of a pro-Hamas adjudication officer.
“Mr. Secretary what is going on here? Is this typical of people who work at DHS? This is an Asylum and Immigration Officer who is posting these frankly pro-genocidal slogans and images on the day that Israelis are being slaughtered in their beds,”
Senator Hawley said. “Has she been fired?”
Secretary Mayorkas declined to answer Senator Hawley’s question, claiming the individual is on administrative leave and that he will not speak on an internal personnel matter.
DHS employee, Newja Ali, has a
documented history
of making virulently antisemitic, pro-Hamas statements, including in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ savage attack on innocent American and Israeli civilians.

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill to Keep Corporate America’s Dollars Out of U.S. Politics
Date: Tuesday, October 31, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Ending Corporate Influence on Elections Act
to get corporate money out of American politics and dramatically cut back on publicly traded corporations’ ability to influence elections. Senator Hawley’s bill will begin to
undo
the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in
Citizens United v. FEC.
“For decades, Corporate America has funneled billions of dollars into elections in favor of politicians who favor their woke, social agendas—instead of American voters’ interests. This legislation would hold mega-corporations’ feet to the fire and stop their dollars from buying our elections,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
Ending Corporate Influence on Elections Act
would:
Ban publicly traded corporations from making independent expenditures, political ads, or other electioneering communications.
Ban publicly traded companies from giving money to Super PACs.
Read the full bill text
here.
Senator Hawley’s new legislation is part of his larger agenda to hold Corporate America accountable for drowning out the voices of the American people:
In September, Senator Hawley introduced legislation to
cap credit card interest rates
at 18 percent and bring relief to working people across America.
Last month Senator Hawley also
visited with workers on strike
at the General Motors plant in Wentzville, Mo., to stand with them and support American jobs.
In May, Senator Hawley introduced legislation to
raise tariffs on imports from China
until the United States’ unsustainable bilateral trade deficit comes into balance.
In April, he unveiled two bills to crack down on
Big Pharma’s exploitative drug prices
and
cap the cost of insulin.
In December 2022, Senator Hawley stood with and voted to
support rail workers
as they sought a fair deal with sick leave.
In April 2021, Senator Hawley introduced legislation to
break up Big Tech companies
seeking to dominate multiple industries simultaneously. More on his efforts to fight back against mega-corporations’ growing influence in America can be found on his
website.

Title: Hawley Exposes Whistleblower Claim that Biden DHS Pulled Agents from Child Exploitation Cases to Make Sandwiches at Southern Border
Date: Tuesday, October 31, 2023

Content:
During a second round of questioning at today’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called out
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for taking special investigators off of human trafficking and fentanyl cases and reassigning them to in-person services at the southern border.
Senator Hawley referenced a whistleblower who came to him with these allegations, then questioned the Secretary. “You’re taking special agents away from investigating child traffickers and child exploitation—when you’ve lost tens of thousands of kids to traffickers—and you’re sending them to make sandwiches at the border,”
said Senator Hawley.
“What is going on?”
Secretary Mayorkas dodged Senator Hawley’s questions about how many migrant children the Biden Administration has recovered out of the 85,000 it has lost. The Secretary also did not deny the DHS whistleblower allegation that at least 600 agents have been pulled from law enforcement work and put on different duties at the southern border.

Title: Senate Passes Hawley Amendment to Budget Bill Blocking Taxpayer Funds to Chinese Corporations
Date: Tuesday, October 31, 2023

Content:
Today the U.S. Senate voted on U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
Amendment (No Funding for Chinese Companies), as part of the upper chamber’s minibus appropriations bill. Senator Hawley’s amendment would prohibit Chinese entities or corporations from receiving any funding provided by the legislation. The amendment passed 61-36.
“The appropriations bills that we are now considering appropriating a total of $280 billion taxpayer dollars. […] This amendment says that none of the money we are appropriating can go to China. It can’t go to Chinese companies or companies that are owned and controlled by China. That’s it, it’s simple. No American taxpayer dollars to the People’s Republic of China,”
said Senator Hawley.

Title: Hawley, Booker Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Crack Down on Child Labor Practices, Hold Corporations Accountable for Violations
Date: Thursday, October 26, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the bipartisan
Preventing Child Labor Exploitation Act
to prohibit companies that illegally employ children from securing coveted federal government contracts. Senator Hawley’s
legislation
comes as the Department of Labor recently
reported
a startling 69 percent increase in illegal child labor since 2018. This dramatic uptick in child-labor exploitation includes a series of high-profile cases involving minors employed in dangerous jobs at sanitation and meatpacking plants.
“Child labor is an abomination and it has no place in our country. Companies that illegally employ children must be held accountable—especially those that contract with the federal government. This bipartisan legislation requires federal contractors to root out child labor in their operations and has the teeth to go after those who don’t comply,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Exploitation of children by big corporations to drive profit is an abhorrent practice, but is not a new one. Across the country, major corporations are relying on children to clean dangerous machinery, handle toxic chemicals, and work exhausting overnight shifts in their facilities for low wages and no benefits. Often, this work is done in violation of existing federal labor laws, but employers have shielded themselves from any accountability by relying on third-party vendors with long records of labor infractions. Despite efforts by Congress and this Administration to challenge these bad practices, too few companies have taken significant steps to address the ongoing child labor issues in their facilities. That’s why today I am joining Senator Hawley to say that, at a bare minimum, there is no reason that the federal government should contract with companies violating child labor law. We must ensure that federal contracts support good-paying jobs, and do not benefit corporations that continue to rely on children working in dangerous environments,”
said Senator Booker.
The
Preventing Child Labor Exploitation Act
would:
Require federal contractors to disclose to the Department of Labor any child labor violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Criminalize a federal contractor’s failure to make required disclosures.
Render repeat offenders ineligible for federal contracts for a period of 4 years.

At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, Senator Hawley
questioned
Robin Dunn Marcos, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, about the
85,000 children
the Biden Administration has lost track of, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers and dangerous child-labor practices.
Senator Hawley
sent a letter
last month to Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King, demanding answers after a disturbing report from
The New York Times
exposed unsafe, illegal child-labor practices within the company.
Earlier this year, Senator Hawley introduced the
Corporate Responsibility for Child Labor Elimination Act, legislation compelling large corporations to eradicate unlawful child labor from their operations in the United States. Senator Hawley also
sent a letter
to FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding a full-scale effort be made to locate the nearly 85,000 missing migrant children.

Title: Senate Passes Hawley Resolution Condemning Antisemitism on College Campuses
Date: Thursday, October 26, 2023

Today the U.S. Senate passed by voice vote U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s
resolution
condemning Hamas and the antisemitic student groups on college campuses that have
celebrated
the Oct. 7 terrorist attack against Israel. The passage of the resolution came after Democrats
blocked
the measure one week ago.
“Mr. President, one week ago I came to this floor to try and pass this very resolution that condemns the violent, genocidal, antisemitic rhetoric and actions on our college campuses all across this country,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Sadly, I was blocked by one of my Democrat colleagues. And since then the situation at our universities has only worsened.”
He continued,
“That’s why what we’re doing today matters and that’s why I am pleased today, that we are able now finally, to pass this resolution that explicitly names the rhetoric, explicitly calls out the language of pro-violence, pro-genocide, and says that is wrong. […] The answer to that kind of hateful, virulent, dangerous speech, is speech with moral purpose. It is language with moral clarity. It is a moral stand that says no, that is wrong. That’s not us. That is not the United States of America. And that, Mr. President, is what we are doing right here, right now, on this floor today.”

Last week, Senator Hawley
urged

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Not one taxpayer dime for Gaza until Hamas frees all the hostages
Date: Wednesday, October 25, 2023

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley | Oct. 25, 2023 |
Fox News
Since October 7, the world has learned with mounting horror exactly what Hamas’s terrorists did in Israel. Women and children slaughtered in their homes. Corpses paraded in the streets of Gaza. Screaming civilians dragged away on motorbikes. Now, the Israeli people fight for their lives, under the shadow of existential threat.
[…]
Last week, Joe Biden unveiled to the American people his latest budget request. Despite what it says, his $106 billion request isn’t really about supporting Israel. Far from it. Rather, this budget request asks Congress to approve billions of dollars in “humanitarian aid”—including some foreign relief funds for Gaza itself.
Gaza is ruled by a terrorist regime, currently holding captive dozens of innocent Israelis and numerous Americans. Let’s get one thing clear. Our policy here should be blindingly simple: no aid until Hamas releases its hostages.
[…]
Making matters worse, this proposal comes on the heels of Biden’s disastrous, $6 billion attempt to buy off Iran. Iran, of course, has been a longtime supporter of Hamas. But last month, the Biden administration agreed to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets—handing the regime vast financial resources to fund terrorism. This is exactly the kind of negotiation with terrorists America can’t afford. Now, every other group—Hamas included—knows that this Administration will pay their shakedown demands.
If Joe Biden and his team won’t keep Americans safe, it’s up to Congress. And here Republicans must take a hard line: no foreign aid for Gaza—none—until every last American hostage is freed and safe.
[…]
But above all else, no funding for terrorist groups. Every American, regardless of political party, should be able to agree on that.

Title: Hawley Slams Biden Official for Releasing Migrant Children to Human Traffickers

questioned
Robin Dunn Marcos, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, about the ongoing child migrant crisis at the southern border and the
85,000 children
that the Biden Administration has lost track of.
“Do you really think that you are helping these children by releasing them to labor traffickers and yes, sex traffickers?”
asked Senator Hawley.
“85,000 children whom you have no contact with and your answer is—we gave them a presentation before we turned them over to these people who are exploiting them on a scale not seen in this country for 100 years.”
When Senator Hawley pressed Director Dunn Marcos to say exactly how many migrant children the department had released into the United States and was also currently in contact with, the Director had no response.
“Let me just ask you this,”
said Senator Hawley.
“How many kids right now—of the 430,000 approximately unaccompanied children who have crossed the border under this administration, it’s an astounding number—how many are you in regular contact with, right now?”
Director Dunn Marcos could not answer Senator Hawley’s question.

Title: Hawley Calls for DOE Watchdog to Investigate Granholm and Agency Staff Following Ethics Violations
Date: Tuesday, October 24, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Energy (DOE) Inspector General Teri Donaldson calling on her to investigate DOE Secretary Granholm for misleading the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee about her financial holdings in
April of this year, and her multiple violations of federal ethics laws.
“Senior officials have no business trading stocks, especially stocks in the industries they regulate. The repeated ethics violations by Energy Department officials undermine the public’s trust in our government and the rule of law,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
During a recent Senate Energy Committee hearing, Senator Hawley also called on the Inspector General to investigate the ethical lapses at the DOE, in light of reports that hundreds of DOE officials hold stocks related to the agency’s work.
Earlier this year Senator Hawley
demanded
DOE Secretary Granholm provide an explanation for
misleading
testimony during a Senate committee
hearing
where she claimed she did not own any personal financial stocks, when in fact, she held individual stocks as recently as May of this year.
Read the full letter to DOE Inspector General Donaldson
here
or below.
October 24, 2023
The Honorable Teri L. Donaldson
Office of Inspector General
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Ave., S.W.
Washington, DC 20585
Dear Inspector General Donaldson,
Thank you for your recent testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in which we discussed the Energy Department’s compliance with ethics rules. I write to formally request you open an investigation into Secretary Granholm’s misleading testimony before the Committee about her financial holdings, as well as her repeated violations of federal ethics rules. I also request you conduct an audit of the Department’s compliance with existing ethics laws to determine whether senior officials own shares in companies they regulate.
Secretary Granholm’s most recent violation of federal stock trading laws is just the latest in a series of ethics indiscretions. Prior to her false testimony before the Committee, Secretary Granholm had already violated federal stock disclosure laws nine times. Then, during her testimony before the Committee on April 20, 2023, Secretary Granholm testified three times, in response to my questions, that she no longer held any stocks. This was not true. At the time, she held stocks in six separate companies.
Instead of being forthright about either her continued stock holdings or her misleading testimony, Secretary Granholm waited until May 18, 2023, to sell the remaining stocks she held. Then, she waited several more weeks to inform the Energy Committee that her testimony to us was untrue.
Secretary Granholm is not the only official at the Energy Department who has traded stocks while in office. As we learned in February of this year, federal employees throughout the Energy Department hold energy-related stocks. I likewise request that, in addition to investigating Secretary Granholm, you conduct an audit of Department of Energy employees to determine whether they are in compliance with ethics rules concerning individual stocks ownership.
Senior officials have no business trading stocks, especially stocks in the industries they regulate. The repeated ethics violations by Energy Department officials undermine the public’s trust in our government and the rule of law.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your prompt response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “Calling for the death of Jewish people is not just another opinion. Calling for the genocide, celebrating the genocide of Jewish babies is not just another opinion. Celebrating the assaults on Jewish people in this country is not just another opinion, and the Senate should be clear and stand with moral clarity and say ‘this is wrong.'”

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Biden DHS for Employment of Pro-Hamas Spokeswoman, Urges Firing
Date: Thursday, October 19, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for the termination of DHS employee, Nejwa Ali, who has a documented history of making blatantly antisemitic, pro-Hamas statements.
Recent
reporting
reveals that Nejwa Ali has shared pictures glorifying Hamas terrorists and espoused other hateful, antisemitic rhetoric. Her statements clearly express that she harbors intensely negative views against the State of Israel and supports the recent attacks from Hamas terrorists.
“I am alarmed by reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently employs a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as an officer charged with adjudicating U.S. immigration cases,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “Ms. Ali’s reported statements make clear that she harbors intensely negative views against the State of Israel and supports the recent barbarism perpetrated against its citizens by Hamas terrorists.”
Senator Hawley pushed for answers on how many immigration cases involving  Palestinians, Israelis, or other Jewish applicants Ms. Ali has reviewed, and what safeguards are in place in the asylum adjudication process to remediate any abuses committed by strongly prejudiced immigration officers.

or below.
October 19, 2023
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
United States Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretary Mayorkas:
I am alarmed by reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently employs a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as an officer charged with adjudicating U.S. immigration cases. According to reports and publicly available records, this employee, Nejwa Ali, has a documented history of making virulently antisemitic, pro-Hamas statements, including in the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ savage attack on innocent American and Israeli civilians. These statements appear to cast severe doubt on her ability to impartially evaluate immigration cases. I am glad to see that she has now been placed on administrative leave—but that is not enough. If these reports are accurate, you must terminate her employment immediately.
Ms. Ali’s reported statements make clear that she harbors intensely negative views against the State of Israel and supports the recent barbarism perpetrated against its citizens by Hamas terrorists. For example, following Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack, she reportedly posted on Instagram: “F*** Israel, the government, and its military. Are you ready for your downfall?” She also reportedly posted an image depicting armed terrorists paragliding into Israel with the caption “Free PALESTINE.” Her social media appears to contain numerous examples of anti-Israel and antisemitic statements, including “Israeli, American privilege is disgusting” and “F*** Israel and any Jew that supports Israel.”
Ms. Ali’s troubling personal views apparently carry into her professional life—including her roles at DHS. She previously worked as a public affairs officer at the PLO’s office in Washington, D.C. before that office was shut down by the Trump Administration. In her current role, she reportedly works as an “Adjudication Officer” within U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) where she is tasked with “review[ing] and mak[ing] determinations on cases for immigration benefits,” among other responsibilities. Prior to this role, she reportedly worked as an “Asylum Officer” responsible for adjudicating asylum applications and conducting credible and reasonable fear screenings. Concerningly, Ms. Ali has explicitly linked her prejudicial views to her job. For instance, in one social media post associated with her name, she included the hashtags “#asylumseekers #palestine #refugeeswelcome”—suggesting that she may preference certain immigration cases over others at DHS. This is unacceptable.
As Secretary, you must assure the American people that those charged with determining who enters the United States do so impartially and without prejudice. If the above reports are true and accurate, you must terminate Ms. Ali’s employment at DHS without delay. Additionally, please provide answers to the following questions:
How many immigration cases involving Palestinians has Ms. Ali reviewed? For each case, please detail Ms. Ali’s involvement and the final determination.
How many immigration cases involving Israelis or other Jewish applicants has Ms. Ali reviewed? For each case, please detail Ms. Ali’s involvement and the final determination.
What safeguards are in place in the asylum adjudication process to remediate any abuses committed by strongly prejudiced immigration officers?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Pushes Mayorkas to Address ‘Terrorist-Linked Aliens’ at Border Following Hamas Attack in Israel
Date: Wednesday, October 18, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urging him to ensure the safety of Americans and, specifically, Jewish Americans amid the uptick in potential terrorist-linked illegal aliens at our southern border. This development follows the barbaric attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists on innocent American and Israeli civilians.
The
recent reporting
of numbers of encounters with people on the terror watchlist for FY2023 from Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) reveals that there were 154 encounters at the northern and southern borders among ports of entry and 505 encountered at the ports of entry.
“Illegal aliens with potential ties to terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah have no place in the United States. In the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is already alerting Americans about an elevated number of violent threats against civilians, including antisemitic threats,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “It is therefore critical that you abandon your radical open border policies, and instead, take immediate action to secure the border.”

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
I write with alarm regarding the uptick in potential terrorist-linked illegal aliens encountered at the southern border. This development follows the barbaric attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists on innocent American and Israeli civilians. It is imperative that you address this issue immediately to ensure the safety of American citizens, especially Jewish Americans, who are facing increased threats to their physical safety following the Hamas attack.
As you are well aware, the United States has experienced an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration across our southern border during the Biden Administration, totaling 6.2 million illegal alien encounters. This figure includes record numbers of aliens who have been listed on the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) or traveled from countries known to be state sponsors of terrorism. In fiscal year 2023, Border Patrol encountered 154 TSDB aliens attempting to cross the border between ports of entry—more than the last six years combined. Furthermore, it is virtually certain that terrorist-linked individuals are among the estimated 1.6 million illegal aliens who have successfully evaded Border Patrol in entering the United States since President Biden took office.
Your Department’s recently published threat assessment acknowledges this danger. For example, the assessment notes that “individuals with terrorism connections are interested in using established travel routes and permissive environments to facilitate access to the United States.” Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are encountering a growing number of “special interest aliens” from countries known to harbor terrorists—including Iran, Syria, and Lebanon. Just this week, four Iranians were apprehended in Texas by Border Patrol.
Illegal aliens with potential ties to terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah have no place in the United States. In the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is already alerting Americans about an elevated number of violent threats against civilians, including antisemitic threats. It is therefore critical that you abandon your radical open border policies, and instead, take immediate action to secure the border. As Secretary, your number one priority should be protecting American citizens against potential terrorist entering our country.
As a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I request that you immediately respond to the following questions to disclose what you know to the American people:
How many “special interest aliens” have been released into the United States in the past two years? Please disaggregate the figures by country of origin.
What steps has DHS taken to heighten security standards at the southern border following Hamas’ attack on Israel?
Is the Department of Homeland Security actively working with the FBI to monitor organizations with links to Hamas’ terrorism activities operating within the United States?
Thank you for your attention to this critical matter of homeland security.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Calls on NCAA to Protect Female Athletes, Clarify Transgender Locker Room Policy
Date: Wednesday, October 18, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) President, former Governor Charlie Baker, following his recent
testimony
before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Senator Hawley called on the NCAA to stand up for the basic safety of their student athletes and asked Governor Baker to explicitly define the NCAA’s policy on transgender athletes’ access to locker rooms.
“Yesterday you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on issues in collegiate athletics. Arguably none is more important than the safety of student athletes,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“That is why I asked you about Riley Gaines, and her Senate testimony earlier this year that the NCAA forced her and other female athletes both to accept a biological man in their locker room and to change alongside this person.”
He continued,
“When I asked you whether the forced inclusion of biological men in women’s locker rooms remains NCAA policy, you equivocated. You testified that you ‘[didn’t] believe that policy would be the policy that we would use today.’ But you declined to state what the NCAA’s policy actually is. This is your chance. The NCAA has a troubled history of using student athletes for financial gain while ignoring their concerns and needs—and in this case, their basic safety. The American public deserves honest answers.”
In June, Senator Hawley
questioned
Riley Gaines about her experiences competing against a transgender athlete, and the trauma she and her teammates endured when their privacy was invaded by being forced to undress in front of a biological male. According to Gaines, an NCAA official told her Lia Thomas was allowed in the female locker room due to a rule change that made the facilities ‘unisex.’

October 18, 2023
Hon. Charlie Baker
President
National Collegiate Athletic Association
700 W. Washington Street
P.O. Box 7110
Indianapolis, IN 46206
Dear Governor Baker:
Yesterday you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on issues in collegiate athletics. Arguably none is more important than the safety of student athletes. That is why I asked you about Riley Gaines, and her Senate testimony earlier this year that the NCAA forced her and other female athletes both to accept a biological man in their locker room and to change alongside this person. Ms. Gaines testified the NCAA made this decision without forewarning the female athletes, without asking for consent, and without obtaining consent of any kind. Worse still, Ms. Gaines and her teammates were allegedly warned that if they spoke in opposition to the NCAA’s policy, they would face consequences.
When I asked you whether the forced inclusion of biological men in women’s locker rooms remains NCAA policy, you equivocated. You testified that you “[didn’t] believe that policy would be the policy that we would use today.” But you declined to state what the NCAA’s policy actually is.
This is your chance. The NCAA has a troubled history of using student athletes for financial gain while ignoring their concerns and needs—and in this case, their basic safety. The American public deserves honest answers. Please provide comprehensive responses to the following questions:
As of today—October 18, 2023—what exactly is the NCAA’s policy on transgender athletes’ access to locker rooms? Please provide a comprehensive explanation.
Has the NCAA or any of its designees or officials ever promulgated a policy, whether through official or unofficial channels, of making locker rooms unisex?
If not, has the NCAA conducted an investigation into why Ms. Gaines was informed in March 2022 that locker rooms would be treated as unisex spaces?
In addressing the issue of transgender competitors, the NCAA is apparently shifting toward a policy of deferring to the governing bodies of individual sports. Will the NCAA defer to the policies of individual sport governing bodies regarding locker rooms and other changing facilities?
If so, please provide a comprehensive explanation of how, from the NCAA’s perspective, allowing biological men to access the locker rooms of female athletes would be consistent with the legal requirements of Title IX that men and women be offered equitable opportunities to participate in sports.
Will the NCAA provide an apology to female student athletes who were required to share locker rooms and other intimate spaces with biological men?
Ms. Gaines has testified that female athletes have been threatened with consequences for publicly opposing the NCAA’s approach to transgender athletes. Does the NCAA maintain or enforce a policy prohibiting public opposition to the league’s policies on transgender athletes?
Has the NCAA ever mandated, recommended, or otherwise advised that individuals opposing the league’s policies on transgender athletes receive counseling or other educational interventions?
I await your responses.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Urges DOJ Investigate Outside Funding of Far-Left, Anti-Israel Student Groups
Date: Monday, October 16, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, urging the Department of Justice (DOJ) immediately deploy resources to
investigate
the third-party funding of far-left student organizations that have called for the effective destruction of Israel.
“In the wake of the brutal terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, we have witnessed an alarming rise in support for violence against the Jewish people,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Public reports indicate that several far-left student groups have lined up to effectively cheerlead Hamas’s genocidal war against the people of Israel.”
He continued,
“Given the potential scale of this threat, I urge you to immediately deploy DOJ resources to investigate these organizations’ funding sources. The First Amendment protects the right to protest. But it does not protect the provision of material support to terrorist organizations. Nor does it insulate financial transactions that threaten our national security. Hamas, as you are well aware, is designated a terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. DOJ should deploy all appropriate authorities to investigate any potential links to organizations that operate within the United States.”

October 16, 2023
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
In the wake of the brutal terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, we have witnessed an alarming rise in support for violence against the Jewish people. Public reports indicate that several far-left student groups have lined up to effectively cheerlead Hamas’s genocidal war against the people of Israel:
At Harvard University alone, 34 student organizations signed a letter declaring that they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,” and that Israel is “the only one to blame” for the unfolding carnage.
The University of California, Los Angeles witnessed a massive protest by students screaming “intifada, intifada”—a call for a violent uprising and the murder of Jewish people.
In New York, Columbia University was forced to close its campus to the public after an Israeli student was violently assaulted by an allegedly pro-Palestine student.
T
he University of Virginia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine announced that the mass murder of civilians was “a step towards a free Palestine . . . reflect[ing] the power and resilience of the Palestinian people.”
Other examples are legion. These student organizations are seemingly lobbying in support of the murder of innocent people, including children and babies. They are menacing Jewish Americans within our cities. And they are doing so in what appears to be a coordinated fashion.
There is a long and sordid history of supposedly independent “human rights” groups operating within American borders, that possess longstanding ties to foreign terrorist organizations. To name just one high-profile example, in the early 2000s, the Department of Justice shuttered the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and jailed its founders, after finding that this supposed charitable organization was funneling money into the pockets of Hamas. It is entirely possible that many of these student organizations, at some level or another, are enmeshed in similar networks—whether as recipients of funding from these malicious actors or as conduits for it.
Given the potential scale of this threat, I urge you to immediately deploy DOJ resources to investigate these organizations’ funding sources. The First Amendment protects the right to protest. But it does not protect the provision of material support to terrorist organizations. Nor does it insulate financial transactions that threaten our national security. Hamas, as you are well aware, is designated a terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. DOJ should deploy all appropriate authorities to investigate any potential links to organizations that operate within the United States.
In particular, the Department should prioritize investigating the following questions:
Of those student organizations presently calling for the effective destruction of Israel and justifying the recent massacre of Jewish people, how many receive significant funding from third-party groups?
Of those third-party groups that offer financial support to pro-Hamas student organizations, or for which pro-Hamas student organizations conduct fundraising, how many have financial or ideological ties to Hamas?
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

“Following the barbaric terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas, my office has received multiple reports of Missourians in Israel who are seeking to leave the region but are struggling to find transportation out of the country,”

Secretary of State
US Department of State

Washington, DC 20520
Dear Secretary Blinken:
I write with concern over the security situation in Israel and the safety of American citizens still in the region. Following the barbaric terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas, my office has received multiple reports of Missourians in Israel who are seeking to leave the region but are struggling to find transportation out of the country. With the growing number of commercial airlines cancelling flights out of Israel, I urge you to consider additional U.S government-facilitated transport options for Americans attempting to return home.
The Bureau of Consular Affairs informed my office yesterday that the State Department currently “is not involved with airlifts, an evacuation, or assisted departure of U.S. citizens.” Today, your office informed mine that the State Department “continue[s] to encourage U.S. citizens to look at the available commercial options to depart Israel.” While I appreciate the initial information provided on Sunday to help my constituents contact the U.S. Embassy, this is no longer sufficient. New clarity about travel assistance is urgently required. I urge you to work with your counterparts across federal agencies to bring to bear all available resources and authorities, including charter flights, to assist Americans that remain in Israel with returning home to their families.
On behalf of my constituents who remain in the region, I request the answers to the following questions from your office as soon as possible.
Is the State Department actively planning to provide additional travel assistance to Americans in Israel?
Is the Department or any other U.S. agencies planning to conduct airlifts or equivalent government-facilitated transportation to help Americans in the region return home?
If plans have been made, how will the State Department communicate those travel options?
When can Americans expect information on how to return home? When can we expect decisions about transportation options to be made?
I look forward to a timely response from your office. And thank you for your attention to this matter.

Title: Hawley Demands Army Fulfill Fort Leonard Wood Housing Promise, Will Hold Nominations
Date: Thursday, October 05, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
— Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Secretary of the Army, Christine Wormuth, demanding that she fulfill her pledge to replace all military housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
“The Army’s inability to meet its own deadlines is unacceptable, and I will wait no longer,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “I will withhold my consent to any future Army civilian nominations which require Senate confirmation. The soldiers and families at Fort Leonard Wood deserve better, and it is your responsibility to deliver for them.”
BACKGROUND
In June of 2021, Senator Hawley
asked
Secretary Wormuth and General McConville for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing at the base.
In May 2022, Senator Hawley
pressed
Secretary Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
A few weeks before his August visit, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary Wormuth requesting an update on the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
In August 2022, Senator Hawley
toured
Fort Leonard Wood, delivered remarks about the important work being done there, and visited with residents about base housing in need of replacement.
In December 2022, Senator Hawley
announced
that the Army committed to spending $41.4 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and another $50 million in Fiscal Year 2024 for new housing at Fort Leonard Wood following repeated demands that aging homes at the base be replaced.
In March, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth requesting, for the third time, the Army’s plan for replacing the aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
Read the full letter
here
or below:
October 5, 2023
Honorable Christine E. Wormuth
Secretary of the Army
101 Army Pentagon
Washington, DC 20310-0101
Dear Secretary Wormuth:
I write with deep concern over the Army’s continual failure to keep its promises to the soldiers and families of Fort Leonard Wood.
In December 2022, after the Army identified 1,142 family homes on post in need of repair, Under Secretary Camarillo pledged to me that the Army would spend $41.4 million during Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) and $50 million during FY24 on homes for families. You acknowledged this same pledge in a phone call with me over the summer. In the ten months since the commitment was made, the Army has continually dragged its feet. Now we know for sure that you have broken your promise. Your staff informs my office that no funds will be available until December 15, 2023, at the earliest, well past the end of the fiscal year which concluded on September 30, 2023. Once again, the Army has failed to prioritize the soldiers and families at Fort Leonard Wood.
As I have written previously, the Army only committed to this investment reluctantly. Despite your commitment during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 5, 2022, the Army has still failed to produce your plan for replacing all housing at Fort Leonard Wood. Beyond your inability to even produce your plan, what investment you have promised has now failed to materialize. The deadline has now come and gone, and given your record I have real doubts that Fort Leonard Wood will receive this investment before the end of the calendar year.
The Army’s inability to meet its own deadlines is unacceptable, and I will wait no longer. Until the promised $41.4 million is invested in housing at Fort Leonard Wood, I will withhold my consent to any future Army civilian nominations which require Senate confirmation. The soldiers and families at Fort Leonard Wood deserve better, and it is your responsibility to deliver for them.
I promise you I will continue to work tirelessly to secure adequate housing for Fort Leonard Wood, and I keep my promises.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill Empowering States to Fight Back Against Biden’s Border Crisis
Date: Wednesday, October 04, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced the
State Border Defense Act
to empower states to fight back against President Biden’s failed immigration policies that are flooding America’s streets with deadly narcotics and enabling a rise in child trafficking. Senator Hawley’s legislation comes after the
Biden Administration’s repeated efforts
to undermine states’ ability to secure their own borders—including preventing the installation of a buoy barrier and razor wire along the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
reported
a record 232,972 southern border encounters in August—the highest monthly total in 2023 thus far.
“Our southern border is overrun. Joe Biden’s dangerous open-border policies are making it worse every single day, leaving states like Missouri to deal with the consequences. Since the federal government refuses to enforce our immigration laws, states must be able to,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
State Border Defense Act
would allow states to:
Remove illegal immigrants from the country rather than sending them to other states
Prosecute people who commit crimes while entering the country illegally
Construct barriers on federal lands or waters along the southern border to prevent illegal immigration

Title: Hawley Requests Update on DOE Monitoring of Nuclear Contamination at Weldon Spring Site
Date: Thursday, September 28, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Energy (DOE) Deputy Secretary David Turk, requesting an update on the monitoring and remediation of the Weldon Spring Superfund Site in St. Charles, Mo.
“As I previously wrote in my July 24, 2023 letter to Secretary Granholm, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) is alarmed by deficiencies in the Department of Energy’s (DOE) monitoring of contaminants at the site, and so am I,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Despite your assurances that the site is ‘remediated,’ the Missouri Department of Natural Resources reports concern that uranium contamination may be spreading from Weldon Spring into local groundwater. Needless to say, contamination of groundwater is grossly unacceptable.”
He continued,
“I am asking you once again to please provide a clear timeline on when DOE will revise its sampling plans and when Weldon Spring will be fully remediated.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley questioned Secretary Turk during an Energy Committee
hearing, pressing him about the DOE’s inaction on the remediation efforts at the Weldon Spring Site.
In July, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm, urging the Department conduct additional testing for radioactive contamination at the Weldon Spring Site, after a review of the site in 2021 led the MDNR to offer an extensive critique of the DOE’s cleanup and monitoring efforts at that location.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
Mr. David Turk
Deputy Secretary
Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue, S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20585
Dear Mr. Turk,
I write in response to your September 7, 2023 email regarding the contaminated Weldon Spring Site. As I previously wrote in my July 24, 2023 letter to Secretary Granholm, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) is alarmed by deficiencies in the Department of Energy’s (DOE) monitoring of contaminants at the site, and so am I.
Despite your assurances that the site is “remediated,” the Missouri Department of Natural Resources reports concern that uranium contamination may be spreading from Weldon Spring into local groundwater. Needless to say, contamination of groundwater is grossly unacceptable. I trust that I need not remind you the health consequences of uranium contamination are significant, causing kidney and heart damage. The residents of St. Charles County deserve to know how DOE will ensure they are not exposed to contaminants in their water.
Despite these significant concerns, and despite my previous letter, you did not come prepared to answer questions about the Weldon Spring site during your recent testimony. I was likewise disappointed that your follow-up email failed to answer whether the DOE will revise its sampling plans in light of MDNR’s concerns. The people of St. Charles County deserve to know if DOE is ensuring their groundwater’s safety.
I am asking you once again to please provide a clear timeline on when DOE will revise its sampling plans and when Weldon Spring will be fully remediated. I look forward to your timely response. Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands DHS Terminate New ‘Intelligence Experts Group’
Date: Thursday, September 28, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for the immediate
termination
of the Department’s newly announced “Intelligence Experts Group.”
“I write with deep concern regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) newly announced ‘Intelligence Experts Group.’ According to your Department’s press release, this entity will be led by at least three individuals who helped suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story preceding the 2020 U.S. presidential election,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Given the composition of its members, this Group seems to constitute yet another effort from the Biden Administration to undermine disfavored speech.”
He continued,
“I will continue to oppose this Administration’s apparent efforts to undermine protected speech. Therefore, I urge you to immediately terminate this so-called ‘Intelligence Experts Group.'”
Last November, Senator Hawley led an
investigation
into President Biden’s plans to establish the Disinformation Governance Board, similar to the “Intelligence Experts Group.” Senator Hawley revealed documents that exposed the DHS’s plans for the Board to monitor and suppress the speech of American citizens, which were much more extensive than the Biden administration had publicly acknowledged.

September 28, 2023
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
I write with deep concern regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) newly announced “Intelligence Experts Group.” According to your Department’s press release, this entity will be led by at least three individuals who helped suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story preceding the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Given the composition of its members, this Group seems to constitute yet another effort from the Biden Administration to undermine disfavored speech.
As you know, John Brennan, James Clapper, and Paul Kolbe all signed onto the infamous October 2020 letter, which falsely declared the Hunter Biden laptop story to be “Russian misinformation.” This was a clear attempt to aid then-candidate Joe Biden. Recent investigations have revealed text messages and emails that corroborate the corrupt intent behind the letter’s publication. It is therefore baffling that your Department would regard these individuals as having any remaining credibility with respect to intelligence matters.
Enlisting the support of these discredited officials as the nation prepares for the 2024 presidential election appears to signal that DHS will continue its attempts to censor speech that is inconvenient to the current Administration. Of course, your Department tried—and failed—to monitor and censor protected speech through the now-defunct Disinformation Governance Board. But thanks to the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in Missouri v. Biden, we know that the White House and other agencies violated the First Amendment by coercing social media platforms to censor online speech. I will continue to oppose this Administration’s apparent efforts to undermine protected speech. Therefore, I urge you to immediately terminate this so-called “Intelligence Experts Group.”
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by October 15, 2023:
All records related to the Intelligence Experts Group, including but not limited to:
written or recorded communications concerning the formation of the Group;
the agenda or minutes from any meeting at which the Group’s formation was discussed;
any legal review to determine whether the activities of the Group would be authorized by the Constitution of the United States;
any communications or records about the individuals who would be recruited to serve on the Group;
any communications with the White House about the formation of the Group or appointment of officials to serve on the Group.
For any documents that are responsive to this request but withheld, please identify the name of each document, the date of its creation, the custodian, a summary of its contents, and the basis for withholding the record.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: ICYMI Hawley Op-ed: Cap credit-card interest rates to help Americans hammered by Bidenomics
Date: Thursday, September 21, 2023

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Sept. 20, 2023 |
New York Post
Exploiting people through high interest rates is wrong.
In a world of Wall Street excess, that simple idea now sounds foreign.
But for thousands of years, it was basic fairness.
“Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother,” declares Deuteronomy 23:19.
The Western world took that principle to heart.
From the Roman Empire on, nations enforced usury laws that severely restricted interest rates on loans.
[…]
Times have changed. Our leaders forgot why those laws existed in the first place.
[…]
The total amount of credit-card debt is more than $1 trillion — the highest in history.
Delinquent payment rates are at their highest level in a decade.
Compounding the problem, President Joe Biden’s inflationary policies have pushed consumer prices to the stratosphere.
This kicked off a vicious cycle.
And as costs rise, Americans are forced to use their credit cards to cover basic necessities like rent and groceries.
[…]
American households get the short straw: Not only are they paying more for basic necessities, they’re now paying to clean up the Biden administration’s financial mess.
This burden falls heaviest on the nearly 50% of Americans carrying a credit-card balance, many struggling to make ends meet.
[…]
Just this year, Tyson Foods announced chicken-plant closures in small-town Missouri that will force 2,000 people out of work.
Those workers and their families still need to live.
If they end up carrying a credit-card balance, why are they fair game for corporate plunder?
As a nation, we can do better than that.
[…]
Supporting America’s workers and families means tackling the everyday problems they face — not giving handouts to corporations or foreign governments and hoping the benefits will eventually trickle down.
[…]
Old slogans about the magic of the market won’t cut it anymore.
Actually passing a law to cap interest rates is a first step toward a better future — a future rooted in our own tradition.
American workers and families deserve it.

Title: Hawley Introduces Legislation Requiring the Timely Reconstruction of Damaged Rural Post Offices
Date: Thursday, September 21, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Rural Post Office Reconstruction Act of 2023, new legislation that would establish a clear timeframe for reopening rural post offices that experience closure due to natural disaster damage or other unforeseen circumstances.
On August 4, 2023, in Baring, Mo., an EF-2 tornado almost
completely destroyed
the town’s Post Office, in addition to damaging nearby homes and businesses. There is still no public timetable for the reconstruction of the Post Office.
“Rural post offices are critical to the daily life of Missourians and Americans everywhere who live in small towns—and they must stay open whenever possible,”
said Senator Hawley.
“My bill guarantees the timely reconstruction of damaged post offices, ensuring rural residents have access to the medical deliveries and other vital services they depend on.”
The
Rural Post Office Reconstruction Act of 2023
would require:
Timely reconstruction of severely damaged post offices;
Reopening closed post offices;
Reporting to Congress in the event remediation is not completed in the specific timeframe.
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Postmaster General Louis Dejoy of the United States Postal Service seeking an update on the status of the Post Office in Baring, Mo.

Title: Hawley Leads Rally for Justice, Demands Compensation for Victims of STL-Area, Nationwide Nuclear Contamination
Date: Thursday, September 21, 2023

Content:
Yesterday U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) held a
bipartisan rally
at the U.S. Capitol with U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), House lawmakers, and victims of nuclear contamination—from the St. Louis area, St. Charles area, and across America—to demand justice and compensation for those who have been harmed by the federal government’s decades of negligence.
“Dating all the way back to the Manhattan Project, the government used the city of St. Louis as a uranium-processing facility, as a major site, and then when that was over […] it allowed it to seep into the groundwater, it allowed it to get into Coldwater Creek, it allowed it get into the soil. Generations of Missourians—children—were poisoned because of the government’s negligence,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senators Hawley and Luján secured funding for victims of nuclear contamination by
getting an amendment passed
in the Senate version of the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) over the summer and, with the help of the victims urging Congress to act, are working with their colleagues to keep this amendment in the final package to be voted on later this year.
“If the government is going to expose its own citizens to radioactive material […] for decades,”
Senator Hawley continued,
“the government ought to pay the bills of the men and women who have gotten sick because of it. They ought to pay for the survivor benefits of those who have been lost.”

Background
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community and all Missourians impacted by government-caused nuclear contamination. Most recently, Senator Hawley
secured President Biden’s endorsement
of his legislation to compensate victims of nuclear radiation exposure.
On July 27, 2023, in a
strong bipartisan vote,
Senator Hawley
secured passage
of an amendment to the FY 2024 NDAA that would provide compensation to victims of government-caused nuclear contamination. The legislation extends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover victims of improperly-stored nuclear waste in affected areas in the St. Louis region. The measure—which was cosponsored by U.S. Senators Luján, Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Schmitt—also reauthorized and strengthened the RECA program to cover more impacted Americans from nuclear tests along with uranium miners.
Earlier in July, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the Department of Energy (DOE), urging additional testing for radioactive contamination at a site in St. Charles County, Mo., after a review of the Weldon Spring site in 2021 offered an extensive critique of the DOE’s cleanup and monitoring efforts there. Senator Hawley also
sent a letter
to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman, Senator Joe Manchin, urging him to convene a committee hearing to discuss the government-caused nuclear contamination of the St. Louis area. In addition, Senator Hawley penned
separate letters
to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), DOE, and Environmental Protection Agency, demanding answers from the government about the nuclear contamination.
In April, Senator Hawley’s legislation mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District and radioactive waste testing
passed the U.S. Senate
and Biden’s Energy Secretary Granholm also vowed to support it.
Earlier in the year, Senator Hawley
delivered remarks
on the Senate floor,
called out
the Biden Administration for its lack of action, and
pushed
the DOE for answers on the radioactive waste found at the school. Senator Hawley also worked with Congresswoman Cori Bush
to send a letter
to USACE, calling for additional radioactive testing of the Hazelwood School District properties after
demanding
last October that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary in light of reported contamination. Following the initial reporting, Senator Hawley
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for impacted students and families.

Title: Hawley Presses Tyson Foods CEO on Dangerous Child Labor Practices
Date: Tuesday, September 19, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King, demanding answers after a disturbing
new report from
The New York Times
exposed unsafe, illegal child labor practices within the company.
“I am alarmed by new reports that Tyson Foods has actively participated in dangerous and illegal child labor practices,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “Any company that employs, facilitates, encourages, or excuses child labor must be held to account. In light of the facts, you owe the American people an explanation as to Tyson’s child-labor practices.”
Last Friday, Senator Hawley spoke with CEO Donnie King and
secured his commitment
to protect Missouri jobs, following an
announcement
that Tyson Foods would be closing its southern Missouri locations. He also introduced the
Strengthening Antitrust Enforcement for Meatpacking Act, which would empower antitrust enforcers to break up giant meatpacking and poultry monopolies and place power back in the hands of Missouri’s farmers and workers.
In May, Senator Hawley introduced the
Corporate Responsibility for Child Labor Elimination Act, legislation to compel large corporations to eradicate unlawful child labor from their operations in the United States.
Read the full letter
here
and below.
September 19, 2023
Donnie D. King
Chief Executive Officer
Tyson Foods
2200 W. Don Tyson Parkway
Springdale, AR 72762
Dear Mr. King:
I am alarmed by new reports that Tyson Foods has actively participated in dangerous and illegal child labor practices. According to a lengthy report published yesterday in the New York Times, the poultry processing industry has regularly contracted with companies that employ child workers and subjected those children to highly unsafe working conditions. I am especially concerned that Tyson is subcontracting illicit child labor to avoid legal liability.
The Times report recounts a number of horrific instances in which children—many, if not most, of whom crossed the southern border as unaccompanied minors—were severely injured or even killed while illegally employed at chicken processing plants. The report opens with the story of a teenager whose arm was ripped down to the tendons after it got caught in a factory machine. It goes on to quote a federal inspector who had tried to “track down a teenager who she heard had fallen from a ladder at Tyson and broken his leg.” Other examples include an eighth grader from Guatemala who was killed two months ago while working the cleaning shift at a Mississippi plant.
Tyson has stated that the company has “no tolerance for child labor,” but the Times report suggests otherwise. According to the Times, every child interviewed by its reporter was fired—after “[s]upervisors who oversaw the cleaning shift at the Tyson plant warned their corporate office that a reporter was spending a lot of time in town.” One of the fired child workers said: “They made plenty of money from our labor and then tossed us out like trash.”
The Times suggests Tyson evades accountability for illegal child labor by relying on subcontractors. “Even when inspectors do catch child-labor violations,” the Times reported, “they usually fine only the subcontracted companies, not the brands themselves.” In short, “the brands that [have] benefitted from the children’s labor [have] faced no consequences.”
Any company that employs, facilitates, encourages, or excuses child labor must be held to account. In light of the facts, you owe the American people an explanation as to Tyson’s child-labor practices. Please provide me with answers to the following questions by the end of this week:
To your knowledge, how many instances of child labor violations have occurred at Tyson facilities in the past five years?
Is Tyson fully cooperating with the Department of Labor and any other state or federal authorities that may be investigating the company over potential violations of child labor law?
What internal controls are in place to ensure that Tyson does not employ underage workers, or subcontract with companies that employ underage workers?
In light of the Times report, what changes to company policy will Tyson be making?
How does Tyson currently handle complaints from its employees or employees of its subcontractors regarding child labor?
Will Tyson pledge to protect whistleblowers who raise concerns regarding child labor?
Will you commit to ending any contracts with companies that have been fined for illegally employing children?
Will you commit to an independent audit to ensure that Tyson’s entire production chain is free of illegal child labor?
I look forward to your prompt response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces New Antitrust Legislation to Break Up Meatpacking, Poultry Monopolies and Empower American Farmers, Workers
Date: Thursday, September 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Strengthening Antitrust Enforcement for Meatpacking Act
to empower antitrust enforcers to break up giant meatpacking and poultry monopolies and place power back in the hands of Missouri’s farmers and workers. The introduction of Senator Hawley’s legislation comes after
Tyson Foods announced
it will be closing the doors of its poultry plants in southern Missouri, costing the state more than 2,000 jobs.
“Today’s meatpacking monopolists are making massive profits while shutting down competition,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Congress must give antitrust prosecutors the power to end anti-competitive behavior without lengthy court battles. It’s time to hold monopolies accountable and empower farmers.”
The
Strengthening Antitrust Enforcement for Meatpacking Act
would:
Amend the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 to establish specific thresholds for market concentration, allowing federal antitrust authorities to more effectively prohibit or unwind acquisitions that concentrate the meatpacking sector.
Deter further meatpacking concentration by disincentivizing entrenched meatpacking interests from buying up more competitors.
Put more power back in the hands of farmers and workers.

Title: Hawley, Klobuchar, Coons, Collins Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Ban the Use of Materially Deceptive AI-Generated Content in Elections
Date: Wednesday, September 13, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) – Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law – joined Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Susan Collins (R-Maine) to introduce the
Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, a bipartisan bill to ban the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate materially deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates in political ads to influence federal elections.
“We must protect the right of Americans to vote without being controlled or manipulated by artificial intelligence companies. Elections belong to the people, not the tech companies,”
said Senator Hawley.
This bill would amend the
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
(FECA) to prohibit the distribution of materially deceptive AI-generated audio, images, or video relating to federal candidates in political ads or certain issue ads to influence a federal election or fundraise. The bill allows federal candidates targeted by this materially deceptive content to have content taken down and enables them to seek damages in federal court. This ban extends to a person, political committee, or other entity that distributes materially deceptive content intended to influence an election or raise money fraudulently. Consistent with the First Amendment, the bill has exceptions for parody, satire, and the use of AI-generated content in news broadcasts.
“Right now, we’re seeing AI used as a tool to influence our democracy. We need rules of the road in place to stop the use of fraudulent AI-generated content in campaign ads. Voters deserve nothing less than full transparency,”
said Senator Klobuchar.
“This commonsense, bipartisan legislation would update our laws to prohibit these deceptive ads from being used to mislead voters no matter what party they belong to.”
“American democracy faces novel threats from deceptive content generated by artificial intelligence, and we must take action to defend our system of free and fair elections. That is why I’m proud to have worked across the aisle to introduce legislation to safeguard federal elections by restricting the use of AI-generated content. I urge my Senate colleagues to swiftly pass this bill and to protect our electoral system from the risks posed by unregulated AI,”
said Senator Coons.
“This bipartisan legislation would help to strengthen the integrity of our elections while also protecting First Amendment rights,”
said Senator Collins.

Title: Hawley Introduces New Legislation to Cap Credit Card Interest Rates and Provide Relief to Working Americans
Date: Tuesday, September 12, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
Capping Credit Card Interest Rates Act, new legislation that would cap credit card interest rates at common sense levels, bringing relief to working people across America.
“Americans are being crushed under the weight of record credit card debt—and the biggest banks are just getting richer,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The government was quick to bail out the banks just this spring, but has ignored working people struggling to get ahead. Capping the maximum credit card interest rate is fair, common-sense, and gives the working class a chance.”
Cumulative consumer credit card debt recently surpassed one trillion dollars, the
highest level
in history. Last year, many major credit cards soared past the 30 percent interest rate threshold for the first time, and now the average rate of interest is hitting a
record level. This means working people face higher financial burdens at the same exact time the biggest banks are
booking bumper profits
and wielding immense power over the market.
Senator Hawley’s
Capping Credit Card Interest Rates Act
would:
Cap the annual percentage rate (APR) for credit cards at 18 percent.
Prevent credit card companies from imposing new fees to evade the cap.
Impose penalties on credit card companies that violate the cap.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Answers from Washington University Transgender Center After Further Evidence of Abuse of Minors
Date: Thursday, September 07, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
demanding that Washington University in St. Louis and BJC Healthcare conduct a fresh evaluation of the practices at The Washington University Transgender Center. Recent
reporting
from the
New York Times
validated
claims made by Jamie Reed, a former case manager at the Center, that the Center commenced experimental treatments on hundreds of minors and lacked appropriate safeguards.
“As you have no doubt seen,
the New York Times
recently published a report which corroborates Jamie Reed’s allegations about the practices at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“In some cases, the
Times
contradicts representations your institutions previously made to my office. You have thus far refused to provide my office with documents regarding the Center, claiming that your internal review revealed no issues at the Center.”
He continued,
“This new report demands a fresh evaluation of the Center’s practices. To date, however, you have refused to provide my office with more than 5,000 documents, which I requested in a letter on April 27, 2023. Please provide such documents to my office immediately. Please also explain any apparent discrepancies between the University’s internal review and the Times report, including anything contained in the
Times
report that you may consider inaccurate.”
In February, Senator Hawley launched an
investigation
into The Washington University Transgender Center, following allegations of
potential malpractice. As part of the investigation, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin and BJC HealthCare President and CEO Liekweg, requesting information about the receipt and use of federal funds in connection with the Center. Chancellor Martin
confirmed
to Senator Hawley that Washington University would comply with the request within four weeks.
Senator Hawley also introduced the
Protecting Our Kids from Child Abuse Act,
which would allow those who were harmed by gender-transition procedures as minors to bring lawsuits against the participating individuals and entities.

Dr. Martin and Mr. Liekweg:
As you have no doubt seen, the New York Times recently published a report which corroborates Jamie Reed’s allegations about the practices at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. In some cases, the Times contradicts representations your institutions previously made to my office. You have thus far refused to provide my office with documents regarding the Center, claiming that your internal review revealed no issues at the Center. In light of this new report, I request once again that you immediately furnish my office with such documentation.
Jamie Reed has been vilified for coming forward with her allegations, and many in the mainstream press and elsewhere rushed to discredit her account. Now, months later, the Times has validated her central claim: that the Center has commenced experimental treatments on hundreds of minors without appropriate safeguards in place. According to the Times:
With its psychologists overbooked, the clinic relied on external therapists, some with little experience in gender issues, to evaluate the young patients’ readiness for hormonal medications. Doctors prescribed hormones to patients who had obtained such approvals, even adolescents whose medical histories raised red flags. Some of these patients later stopped identifying as transgender, and received little to no support from the clinic after doing so.
The Times report invites further scrutiny into previous statements contained in the University’s internal review of the Center, which was provided to my office on April 21, 2023. For example, the review states that University physicians and Center staff “treat patients according to the currently accepted standard of care.” According to text messages obtained by the Times, however, the Center’s lead physician said he had “no idea how to meet what would be the most intensive interpretations” of the latest standard of care—raising questions about the procedures and processes actually employed at the Center.
The Times report shows that the Center makes little to no effort to follow up with patients or track their outcomes, directly contradicting the results of your own internal review. In one case independently verified by the Times, a patient de-transitioned three years after being prescribed testosterone following just one visit to the Center, but was treated dismissively by Center staff and told there was no need for follow-up. According to the patient, “overall, there was a major lack of care and consideration for me.” As evidenced by its practices, the Center is apparently uninterested in its patients’ outcomes over the long term.
Additionally, despite the University’s claim in its review that “[m]ental health care and counseling is a priority at the Center,” the Times found that the Center largely outsources this to outside therapists, many of whom do not possess relevant expertise. It appears the Center’s practice only requires a single letter from such a therapist to vet a minor’s mental health before prescribing the minor potentially irreversible medications. The Times also confirmed numerous patients at the Center who had severe psychiatric issues, including one on testosterone who stopped taking schizophrenia medication without consulting a doctor.
This new report demands a fresh evaluation of the Center’s practices. To date, however, you have refused to provide my office with more than 5,000 documents, which I requested in a letter on April 27, 2023. Please provide such documents to my office immediately. Please also explain any apparent discrepancies between the University’s internal review and the Times report, including anything contained in the Times report that you may consider inaccurate.
Finally, please describe in detail the Center’s plans to comply fully with §§191.1720 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, which generally prohibits the prescription or administration of puberty-blocking drugs or cross-sex hormones to minors, among other provisions.
I look forward to your response.

Title: Hawley Urges Postal Service to Prioritize Rebuilding Post Office Destroyed in Baring, Mo., Tornado
Date: Wednesday, September 06, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Postmaster General Louis Dejoy of the United States Postal Service (USPS) seeking an update on the status of the Post Office in Baring, Mo.,
after it was destroyed
by a tornado on August 4, 2023.
“Losing a functioning Post Office is more than an inconvenience for Baring’s citizens. They risk losing access to reliable medical delivery, payment disbursements, and indispensable communications,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “United States Postal Service (USPS) should prioritize rebuilding this critical infrastructure as soon as possible to ensure the people of Baring promptly regain access to deliveries and other vital services that they depend on.”

or below.
September 6, 2023
The Honorable Louis Dejoy
Postmaster General
United States Postal Service
475 L’Enfant Plaza SW
Washington, DC 20024
Dear Postmaster General Dejoy,
I write to urge you to immediately address the closure of the Post Office in Baring, Missouri, which was recently damaged by a tornado. United States Postal Service (USPS) should prioritize rebuilding this critical infrastructure as soon as possible to ensure the people of Baring promptly regain access to deliveries and other vital services that they depend on.
On August 4, 2023, Knox County was struck by an EF-2 tornado. According to reports, this natural disaster affected local businesses, damaged 62 homes, and almost completely destroyed Baring’s Post Office building. The tornado removed the building’s roof and several walls; it has now been deemed inoperative. According to a recent USPS press release, mail operations at the facility will be suspended.  Encouragingly, it appears that some deliveries will be rerouted to the Edina Post Office for P.O. Box customers. While this is a helpful remedy for some residents, USPS must promptly restore normal operations and services to the area.
Losing a functioning Post Office is more than an inconvenience for Baring’s citizens. They risk losing access to reliable medical delivery, payment disbursements, and indispensable communications. I therefore urge you to rebuild the Post Office, resume normal deliveries, and initiate a public awareness campaign, in coordination with local officials, to make sure Baring residents are informed of the remedial steps your agency is taking.
As a Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I know the important work that USPS performs on a daily basis for millions of Americans. I am also committed to making sure that the committee oversees how USPS ensures services for rural residents following natural disasters, like this one. I am therefore also requesting regular updates on the reconstruction of the Baring Post Office building so that, together, we can ensure that Baring residents are served by USPS.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Biden Backs Hawley-Luján Legislation to Provide Aid to Victims of Nuclear Contamination
Date: Thursday, August 10, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
— U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement after President Biden
endorsed
Senator Hawley’s legislation to compensate victims of government-caused nuclear contamination originating from the Manhattan Project.
Senator Hawley’s legislation was adopted by the Senate
as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in July. The legislation was introduced with support from Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
Senator Hawley said:
“Compensating victims of government-caused nuclear contamination and negligence should not be a partisan issue. It’s about justice. I am glad President Biden has announced his support of our amendment, but now we need action. This amendment must be included in the final negotiated defense bill that the President signs into law. And we also must hear from the Biden Administration about their next steps to support victims in the St. Louis area and beyond.”

Title: Senate Adopts Hawley Legislation Providing Funding for Victims of STL Region Nuclear Contamination
Date: Thursday, July 27, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
legislation
to compensate victims of government-caused nuclear contamination in the greater St. Louis area was
adopted
by the U.S. Senate. The legislation took the form of an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Senator Hawley’s legislation was co-sponsored by Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
“For fifty years, fifty years the federal government has put into the water, into the soil, into the air of St. Louis and surrounding regions radioactive nuclear material,”
said Senator Hawley.
“They have not told the people of St. Louis. They have not compensated the people of St. Louis. They have not helped the people of St. Louis.”
He continued,
“Mr. President, it is time to make this right. The amendment we are about to vote on is a very simple amendment—it is about basic justice—compensating the victims of the federal government’s negligence for what the government itself has done.”
HUGE WIN today for Missouri in the Senate. We just adopted my proposal to compensate the victims of the federal government’s radioactive waste all across the St. Louis region. Big step forward for JUSTICE – now needs to pass the House – more to come
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
July 27, 2023
Senator Schmitt said,
“It’s unconscionable that this radioactive waste was allowed to be recklessly dumped around the St. Louis area, and the ones paying for it the most are innocent St. Louis families. I grew up in Bridgeton, at the epicenter of this issue, and this is near and dear to my heart. The federal government has an obligation to keep Americans safe, and the pure negligence that has harmed St. Louisans has been brushed aside and covered up for far too long. I’m proud to co-sponsor Senator Hawley’s amendment in order to ensure this disaster is rectified and radiation victims in St. Louis are taken care of.”
Senator Hawley’s legislation will:
Extend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover victims of improperly stored Manhattan Project waste in the St. Louis region.
Provide RECA compensation to those living in particular geographic areas who suffer from diseases associated with long-term exposure to radiation.

to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), DOE, and Environmental Protection Agency, demanding answers from the government about the nuclear contamination.
In April, Senator Hawley’s legislation mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District and radioactive waste testing
passed the U.S. Senate
and Biden’s Energy Secretary Granholm also vowed to support it.
Earlier in the year, Senator Hawley
delivered remarks
on the Senate floor,
called out
the Biden Administration for its lack of action, and
pushed
the DOE for answers on the radioactive waste found at the school. Senator Hawley also worked with Congresswoman Cori Bush
to send a letter
to USACE, calling for additional radioactive testing of the Hazelwood School District properties after
demanding
last October that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School in light of reported contamination. Following the initial reporting, Senator Hawley
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for impacted students and families.

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal Hold Hearing On Principles For Regulating Artificial Intelligence
Date: Wednesday, July 26, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ranking Member and Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, held a
hearing
on the guiding principles for regulating artificial intelligence (A.I.) moving forward.
Senator Hawley questioned leaders in the A.I. space—including Dario Amodei, Cofounder and CEO of Anthropic, Yoshua Bengio, Professor at the Université de Montréal, and Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley—on the role of Big Tech in smaller A.I. development firms, the importance of safeguarding our A.I. supply chains, and the issue of offshoring of A.I.-related jobs.
“For my part, I have expressed my own sense of what our priorities ought to be when it comes to legislation. It’s very simple: workers, kids, consumers, and national security,”
said Senator Hawley.
“As A.I. develops, we have got to make sure that we have safeguards in place that will ensure this new technology is actually good for the American people.”
He continued,
“I’m less interested in the corporation’s profitability, in fact I’m not interested in that at all. I’m interested in protecting the rights of American workers and American families and American consumers against these massive companies that threaten to become a total law unto themselves.”

Title: Hawley Demands DOE Improve Nuclear Contamination Cleanup Efforts at Weldon Spring Site
Date: Monday, July 24, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm, urging the Department conduct additional testing for radioactive contamination at a site in St. Charles County, Mo. After a review of the Weldon Spring site in 2021, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources offered an extensive critique of the DOE’s cleanup and monitoring efforts at that location. These concerns were recently made public.
“On May 27, 2021, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources submitted extensive comments on the Department’s Weldon Spring Site Draft Sixth Five-Year Review,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“That review […] aimed to analyze the state of contamination at the Weldon Spring site. In those comments, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources identified serious sampling deficiencies in the Department’s remediation plan.”
He continued,
“DOE must immediately take steps to conduct additional sampling in this area, including through the establishment of additional monitoring sites, pursuant to the detailed request provided by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.”

or below.
July 24, 2023
The Honorable Jennifer Granholm
Secretary
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Ave, S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20585
Secretary Granholm:
The residents of my state are suffering from ongoing radioactive contamination. That contamination was caused by the government’s Manhattan Project efforts, and it has never been properly cleaned up. Instead of active remedies, the government now relies on a strategy of “monitored natural attenuation”—essentially, hoping the problem corrects itself.
We know now that current measures are not enough. And your Department has been aware of the problem for years. On May 27, 2021, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources submitted extensive comments on the Department’s Weldon Spring Site Draft Sixth Five-Year Review. That review—which was prescribed by Section 121 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986—aimed to analyze the state of contamination at the Weldon Spring site.
In those comments, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources identified serious sampling deficiencies in the Department’s remediation plan. Among them:
The unweathered zone for uranium, northwest of monitoring well 4043, was insufficiently defined. An additional Burlington-Keokuk monitoring well should be placed in this region, with its location determined by a geophysical survey using electrical resistivity tomography and multichannel analysis of surface waves.
The sampling of the Burlington-Keokuk Limestone bedrock was insufficient. Additional sampling locations are required to properly account for vertical and lateral contaminant distribution.
Insufficient monitoring sites were present within the monitoring well network in the area of the Chemical Plant.
The sampling of uranium content in the Femme Osage Slough was based on 1997 data, not current data. As a result, stakeholders have no way of knowing whether radiation levels in this area remain within acceptable parameters.
Existing monitoring wells were not sampling at the same depth level—one well was monitoring 47-52 feet below ground level, while others were monitoring at 77-97 and 95-105 feet below ground level. Accordingly, more monitoring wells are needed to ensure consistency.
DOE must immediately take steps to conduct additional sampling in this area, including through the establishment of additional monitoring sites, pursuant to the detailed request provided by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, please provide the following information by August 15, 2023.
Since 2021, has DOE taken any steps to revise its remediation strategy for the Weldon Spring site in light of these comments from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources?
Please provide an estimate of the projected cost of expanding sampling measures consistent with the recommendations of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. The residents of St. Louis and its surrounding communities deserve justice.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Urges Senate Hearing on Government-Caused Nuclear Contamination in the St. Louis Region
Date: Wednesday, July 19, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), urging him to convene a committee hearing to discuss the government-caused nuclear contamination of the St. Louis area as well as the steps that involved government agencies are taking to remediate the area.
“Last week, new reports provided stunning information about radioactive contamination in the St. Louis area resulting from the Manhattan Project.  These reports reveal that contamination in the St. Louis area may prove to be among the most significant government-caused environmental disasters in our nation’s history,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“What’s worse, it’s now clear that the Federal government knew about the contamination but failed to appropriately inform the public.”
He continued, “Residents in the St. Louis area, and frankly all Americans, deserve answers from the federal government about this horrible catastrophe. I urge you to convene a hearing with department officials to discuss the agencies’ roles in this government-caused disaster and the steps the agencies are taking to remediate the area.”
Senator Hawley
traveled to the St. Louis region
last week and visited Jana Elementary School and Coldwater Creek, areas both affected by decades-old nuclear contamination. During a rally with advocates from the community, Senator Hawley called on the federal government to authorize a fund for St. Louis residents who fell victim to radioactive contamination due to bureaucratic negligence and vowed to do everything in his power to bring the community justice.
Background
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community.
Last week, Senator Hawley
spoke
on the Senate floor where he
announced
new legislation to create a fund for the victims of radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region.
Senator Hawley’s legislation mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District and radioactive waste testing recently

July 19, 2023
The Honorable Joe Manchin
Chairman
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
United States Senate
Washington, 20510
Chairman Manchin:
Last week, new reports provided stunning information about radioactive contamination in the St. Louis area resulting from the Manhattan Project. These reports reveal that contamination in the St. Louis area may prove to be among the most significant government-caused environmental disasters in our nation’s history. What’s worse, it’s now clear that the Federal government knew about the contamination but failed to appropriately inform the public. I urge you to convene an oversight hearing as soon as possible to investigate this matter.
In the 1940’s, uranium processing for the Manhattan project took place in downtown St. Louis, resulting in radioactive waste. The federal government then stored this waste above ground near the St. Louis airport for twenty years. The waste was improperly stored, causing it to seep into the ground and the nearby Coldwater Creek. In 1966, the Federal government hired a company, Cotter Corp, to dispose of the waste. Instead of properly disposing of the waste, the company dumped it in the West Lake Landfill, where it remains today.
The Department of Energy knew about contamination in Coldwater Creek as early as 1965, but kept information about the contamination from the public until 1990. According to the report, “Federal agencies knew of the potential human health risks of the creek contamination, but repeatedly wrote them off as ‘slight,’ ‘minimal,’ or ‘low-level.’” Moreover, despite warnings from experts in Missouri, the Environmental Protection Agency failed to conduct adequate testing of the Westlake Landfill and continues to ignore Missouri experts’ warnings of spreading contamination. These are just a few of the disturbing revelations from the 15,000 pages of government documents obtained by the news media.
During my time on this Committee, I have pressed Department of Energy officials to remediate radioactive contamination in the St. Louis area. And, as you know, on October 18, 2022 the Hazelwood School District shut down Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Missouri, after private testing found radiation levels that were 22 times higher than normal levels in the school. I have written to the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and even the President asking for remediation of the elementary school and the Federal government has yet to take meaningful action.
Residents in the St. Louis area, and frankly all Americans, deserve answers from the federal government about this horrible catastrophe. I urge you to convene a hearing with department officials to discuss the agencies’ roles in this government-caused disaster and the steps the agencies are taking to remediate the area.

Title: Hawley, Gillibrand to Introduce Landmark Bill Banning Stock Trading and Ownership by Congress, Executive Branch Officials and Their Families
Date: Wednesday, July 19, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) will
introduce
the bipartisan
Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act. The legislation would create stringent stock trading bans and disclosure requirements for Congress, senior executive branch officials, and their spouses and dependents. The bill bans stock trading, stock ownership, and blind trusts; imposes heavy penalties for executive branch stock trading; requires reporting of federal benefits; creates additional transparency in financial disclosure reports; and increases transaction report penalties under the original
STOCK Act.
“Politicians and civil servants shouldn’t spend their time day-trading and trying to make a profit at the expense of the American public, but that’s exactly what so many are doing,”
said Senator Hawley.
“My bill with Senator Gillibrand is common sense: ban elected and executive branch officials from trading or holding stocks, and put the American public first.”
“Sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is critical that the American people know that their elected leaders are putting the public first – not looking for ways to line their own pockets,”
said Senator Gillibrand.
“The landmark Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act bars members of Congress, executive branch officials and their families from holding or trading stocks, increases disclosure requirements and imposes harsh penalties on violators. This bill is the most substantive bipartisan effort to date and I’m going to work hard alongside Senator Hawley to get it signed into law.”
The
Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act
includes the following provisions:
Bans stock trading and blind trusts
Prohibits members of Congress, the president, vice president, senior executive branch members, and their spouses and dependents from holding or trading stocks.
There is no exception for blind trusts.
For members of Congress, failure to comply means a heavy penalty of at least 10 percent of the value of the prohibited investments.
Imposes heavy penalties for executive branch stock trading
Executive branch officials must disgorge profits from covered financial interests to Treasury.
Automatic Special Counsel fine of not less than the value of the covered investment that was purchased or sold in violation of the ban or up to $10,000, whichever is more.
The Office of Special Counsel may refer the case to the attorney general and recommend additional civil action if the case is “comparatively substantial in monetary value or extraordinary in nature.”
Requires reporting of federal benefits
Requires members of Congress, senior congressional staff, the president, vice president, and senior executive branch employees to report any time they, a spouse, or a dependent applies for or receives a benefit of value from the federal government.
This includes loans, agreements, contracts, grants, and payments. It does not include salary, compensation or tax refunds.
It would require reporting that includes payment type, recipient name, date and amount.
A penalty of $500 would be imposed for failure to file.
Creates transparency in financial disclosure reports
Requires public, searchable databases of personal financial disclosure reports and filings reporting of any financial transactions as required by the
STOCK Act.
Increases STOCK Act transaction report penalties
Increases penalty ($200 to $500) for failing to file
STOCK Act
transaction reports.

Title: Hawley Urges Action on Law Requiring ‘Duck Boat’ Safety Regulations
Date: Tuesday, July 18, 2023

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Linda Fagan calling for the law requiring new safety standards for DUKW amphibious vehicles, also known as “duck boats,” to be properly implemented. New standards are intended to help prevent future tragedies following the 2018 accident on Table Rock Lake that claimed the lives of 17 people.
“When I joined the Senate, one of the first bills I introduced was the Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act of 2020. This legislation aimed to prevent similar accidents in the future by requiring amphibious vehicles meet minimum buoyancy requirements, weather preparedness standards, and new canopy regulations,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “It is critically important that we ensure the safety of all passengers and prevent future accidents.”
Senator Hawley introduced his
Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act
originally in 2019, and through a series of
reintroductions
it passed the House and Senate. The new standards were
signed into law
as part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. That law gave the Coast Guard six months to take action on implementing the additional safety standards—a deadline that has now passed.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
July 18, 2023
Admiral Linda Fagan
Commandant
U.S. Coast Guard
2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, DC 20032
Dear Commandant Fagan,
I write concerning the United States Coast Guard’s statutory obligation to issue new safety regulations for DUKW amphibious vehicles, also known as “duck boats.”
As you may know, on July 19, 2018, Missouri experienced one of the deadliest boating accidents in U.S. history. An amphibious duck boat capsized during a severe thunderstorm on Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri, tragically claiming the lives of 17 people. That is why, when I joined the Senate, one of the first bills I introduced was the Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act of 2020. This legislation aimed to prevent similar accidents in the future by requiring amphibious vehicles meet minimum buoyancy requirements, weather preparedness standards, and new canopy regulations.
As you know, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 included this legislation, which requires you to “initiate a rulemaking to establish additional safety standards for DUKW amphibious passenger vessels” within “6 months.” President Biden signed this into law on December 23, 2022. It has now been over six months.
While there are some indications you have begun work on these new standards, I urge you to complete this process and issue the new guidance as soon as possible. It is critically important that we ensure the safety of all passengers and prevent future accidents. By August 1, 2023, please provide my office an update on the status of this regulation and your expected timeline for issuing the rule.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: NEW: Senator Hawley Demands USACE, DOE, and EPA Answer for St. Louis Contamination
Date: Friday, July 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent separate letters to United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan demanding answers on nuclear contamination in the St. Louis region.
Senator Hawley’s letters followed a disturbing new
report
of a decades-long effort to downplay and conceal the risks of radioactive contamination in St. Louis, Missouri. The report verified that the federal government and companies responsible for Manhattan Project nuclear testing in the St. Louis area, “were aware of health risks, spills, improperly stored contaminants and other problems but often ignored them.”
On Wednesday, Senator Hawley delivered remarks about the report on the Senate floor and
announced new legislation
to create a fund for the victims of the radioactive contamination. Yesterday, Senator Hawley traveled to the St. Louis region, attended a rally with advocates from the community, and
called on
the federal government to support his legislation.
To the USACE, Senator Hawley wrote:
“The United States Army Corps of Engineers has spent the last year ignoring calls to conduct testing for radioactive contamination at St. Louis schools. Your excuse has been that USACE already knows the location of the contamination. It is now clear how ridiculous those statements are; the government’s efforts to track contamination in St. Louis have been nonchalant, even negligent.”
He continued,
“The allegations in this report require that you revisit your refusal to conduct further testing of the Hazelwood School District. […] The government cannot continue to hide behind claims that it has competently tracked this deadly contamination.”
Read the full USACE letter
here.
To the DOE, Senator Hawley wrote:
“These incidents are, as the report says, ‘the tip of the iceberg.’ There are too many incidents of concealed contamination and negligent testing to reproduce in this letter. And these incidents are not confined to the distant past, the DOE has ignored calls for further testing in the St. Louis area just this year. The allegations in this report demand answers.”
Read the full DOE letter
here.
To the EPA, Senator Hawley wrote:
“The details of the report are appalling. Despite knowing of contamination at the West Lake Landfill as early as 1974, the EPA failed to discover and disclose the full extent of the contamination until May of this year. During that time, the contamination has been spreading, leeching into the surrounding land and clinging to trucks leaving the landfill.”
He continued,
“The people of St. Louis have a right to know the full extent of radioactive contamination in their community—along with when exactly the West Lake Landfill will be cleaned up.”

Background:
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community. Most recently, Senator Hawley’s legislation mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District and radioactive waste testing

“Now we have got to put in place this fund to make whole every person who has been ill and who has suffered any kind of negative consequence from this,”
said Senator Hawley.
[…] “The federal government has done this before for other victims of their nuclear programs.”
“Your government asked you to bear the brunt of a nuclear program that they never owned up to and its effects, and now it’s time that they gave you some basic justice for what they have done,”

Title: Senators Hawley and Vance Introduce Legislation to Prevent Further Accounting Errors at the DoD
Date: Wednesday, July 12, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) introduced
legislation
to require the Department of Defense (DoD) to use accounting methods that capture the true cost of sending weapons from U.S. stockpiles abroad. This legislation will help prevent further
accounting issues
at the Department, including the $6.2 billion “valuation error” of certain military equipment provided to Ukraine.
“The so-called ‘valuation errors’ around U.S. aid to Ukraine is a transparent attempt to bypass Congress for additional funds, while continuing to prioritize Ukraine over more vital U.S. interests, including deterring China in the Pacific,”
said Senator Hawley.
“We must force the DoD to appropriately account for any future aid, not only for Ukraine, but also for all U.S. security assistance going forward.”
“This legislation will save American taxpayers from footing the bill for shoddy accounting at the Pentagon,”
said Senator Vance.
“There should be no excuse for accounting errors with a seven-figure price tag. With this bill, Congress can ensure that the cost of our military aid is properly and consistently calculated.”
Earlier this week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
with several colleagues to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding an explanation from the DoD for the
reported
$6.2 billion accounting error in U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.
In March, Senator Hawley introduced the
Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance Act
to establish a Special Inspector General to oversee the military and non-military assistance to Ukraine. He also called for a vote on his measure to
demand more accountability
in March, at which time
68 Senators
voted against it.
The Senators’
legislation
would:
Ensure the DoD’s valuation of defense articles and services sent abroad under the Presidential Drawdown Authority section in 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act accurately reflects what these transfers will cost American taxpayers.

Title: Hawley Announces New Legislation to Compensate Victims of Nuclear Waste in St. Louis Area
Date: Wednesday, July 12, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced new legislation to create a fund for the victims of radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region. His announcement followed a
disturbing new report
that details how the federal government and companies responsible for Manhattan Project waste in the region “were aware of health risks, spills, improperly stored contaminants and other problems but often ignored them.”
“The people of St. Louis have borne the burden of [the Manhattan Project] — and now it’s time for their government to make it right. What needs to happen is this: The federal government needs to pay the medical bills for any St. Louis resident who has contracted cancer or an autoimmune virus or a genetic disorder because of exposure to radioactive contamination,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “I will introduce legislation that will provide this support, that will provide this justice to the people of St. Louis. […] This is not a handout to the people of St. Louis. They’re not asking for a giveaway. They’re asking for some basic fairness. When their government imposes on them diseases and disaster because of nuclear contamination, the least their government can do is to make it right. And I will come to this floor as long as it takes until we make it right for the men and women and children of St. Louis.”

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Demand Answers from Biden DoD on Ukraine Aid Accounting Error
Date: Tuesday, July 11, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), joined by Senators JD Vance (R-Ohio), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.),
sent a letter
to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
demanding an explanation
from the Department of Defense (DoD) for the
reported
$6.2 billion accounting error in U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. As President Biden arrives in Lithuania for a critical NATO summit, the Senators called for limits on military aid to Ukraine and questioned the DoD’s accounting procedures.
“On June 20, 2023, a DoD spokesperson asserted that DoD had been ‘overestimating the value’ of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine by a combined $6.2 billion over fiscal years 2022 and 2023,”
the Senators wrote.
“These so-called ‘valuation errors’ are particularly concerning given the nature and scope of U.S. aid to Ukraine—over $113 billion thus far […] This is a transparent attempt to bypass Congress for additional funds, while continuing to prioritize Ukraine over more vital U.S. interests, including deterring China in the Pacific.”
“By using creative accounting to conceal the actual cost of supporting Ukraine, you appear to be circumventing the American people’s elected representatives. Congress, not DoD, possesses the power of the purse,”
the Senators concluded.
In March, Senator Hawley introduced the
Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance Act
to establish a Special Inspector General to oversee the military and non-military assistance to Ukraine.

Honorable Lloyd Austin
Secretary of Defense
1000 Defense Pentagon
Washington, DC 20301
Dear Secretary Austin,
We write to inquire about Department of Defense (DOD) accounting procedures for U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.
On June 20, 2023, a DOD spokesperson asserted that DOD had been “overestimating the value” of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine by a combined $6.2 billion over fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Specifically, the spokesperson noted that “[military] services used replacement costs rather than net book value” in many cases, and that this sum would subsequently “go back into the pot of money” allocated for Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) for Ukraine.
These so-called “valuation errors” are particularly concerning given the nature and scope of U.S. aid to Ukraine—over $113 billion thus far. By relying largely on PDA for Ukraine security assistance, DOD sends existing equipment to Ukraine and purchases new equipment to replace U.S. stocks. The true cost to American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine is therefore the replacement cost, not the net book value. While accounting consistency is certainly in the interest of good governance—especially given DOD’s habitual inability to pass a financial audit—this is a transparent attempt to bypass Congress for additional funds, while continuing to prioritize Ukraine over more vital U.S. interests, including deterring China in the Pacific. This is yet another example of why we do not support further appropriations to Ukraine.
By using creative accounting to conceal the actual cost of supporting Ukraine, you appear to be circumventing the American people’s elected representatives. Congress, not DOD, possesses the power of the purse. We will continue to safeguard this constitutional responsibility, and therefore request answers to the following questions no later than August 10, 2023.
How does DOD justify the use of net book value vice replacement costs when the equipment given to Ukraine must be replaced with new equipment?
How is DOD calculating the net book value of equipment given to Ukraine?
Prior to this updated accounting guidance, which military services were using replacement cost and which were using net book value or other methods?
What is the total replacement cost to backfill U.S. equipment and munitions stocks that have been drawn down for Ukraine?
If DOD intends to use net book value going forward, but still needs to replace equipment for U.S. stocks based on replacement value, how does DOD propose to fund the full replacement cost?
Given the apparent difficulties DOD is experiencing with properly accounting for Ukraine security assistance, how would a Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance aid you in this effort?
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Graves, and Missouri Members Urge the USDA to Assist with Drought Impacting Farmers and Ranchers
Date: Thursday, July 06, 2023

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Representative Sam Graves (MO-06), Senator Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), and Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-03), Jason Smith (MO-08), Mark Alford (MO-04), and Eric Burlison (MO-07) in
sending a letter
to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack urging the USDA to open Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands for emergency haying in order to provide immediate relief for Missouri’s farmers and ranchers.
“Over 80 percent of Missouri is currently experiencing at least a moderate drought, with more than half the state in a severe drought, and 20 percent suffering under extreme drought conditions. These conditions have left Missouri farmers and ranchers with few remaining options to feed their livestock through the winter until CRP lands are opened to haying,”
the Members wrote.
They continued, “For these reasons, we urge you to explore all available options to immediately open CRP lands in Missouri to emergency haying to provide sufficient forage for livestock.”

The Honorable Thomas J. Vilsack
Secretary United States Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Avenue, S. W. Washington, D.C. 20250
Dear Secretary Vilsack,
We write to you today regarding the ongoing drought conditions in the state of Missouri and the impending forage and feed crisis facing farm families in our state.
Over 80 percent of Missouri is currently experiencing drought conditions, with more than half of the state experiencing severe drought and nearly 20 percent suffering under extreme drought conditions. While current conditions are concerning, this current crisis has been building for months.
Many farmers have been facing moderate to severe drought conditions for much of the growing season. As a result, available forage in pastures and hay crop yields are far below typical for our state. Farmers and ranchers have reported feeding hay to livestock in June, long before Missouri farmers typically begin feeding hay in November.
The acute shortage of quality hay and forage due to drought conditions has led to a concerning uptick in scams targeting farm families desperate to feed their herds. While many farmers and ranchers have grazed or hayed just about every square inch of available forage, acres enrolled in the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) remain a largely untapped emergency relief valve.
While emergency grazing has been opened in some counties experiencing the most extreme drought conditions, it can be challenging for farmers to take advantage of these flexibilities. In many cases, these CRP lands do not have adequate fencing or water access for livestock. That forces already struggling farmers and ranchers to break their backs trying to build fence and haul water to care for their herds.
Faced with this daunting challenge, many have resigned themselves to selling off portions of their herds. In many cases, these families have spent generations building herd numbers and refining genetics to maximize the quality and quantity of production. Forcing these families to sell their herds or watch them starve will have devastating impacts on our communities for decades to come. Compounded with the other challenges facing farm families, including rising interest rates and astronomical input costs, this crisis threatens the very foundations of our agricultural economy.
We understand that emergency haying practices may be opened in some limited areas after the end of the primary nesting season on July 15th, but we have grave concerns that the quality or forage available for haying could substantially decline within the coming weeks.
For these reasons, we urge you to explore all available options to immediately open CRP lands in Missouri to emergency haying to provide sufficient forage for livestock. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley                                             Eric Schmitt

Title: Hawley Urges EPA to Report on Coldwater Creek Chemical Spill
Date: Wednesday, July 05, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan, requesting a briefing from the EPA on the chemical spill near St. Louis Lambert Airport and Coldwater Creek. The EPA initially responded to contaminated industrial wastewater last week, and
reports
suggest the public was not immediately notified of the spill.
“Last week, your agency responded to a chemical spill near St. Louis Lambert Airport and Coldwater Creek. While the EPA originally stated that approximately 1,000 gallons of wastewater, contaminated with trivalent chromium, may have made its way into the creek area on June 27, subsequent reports have provided additional information,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“These new reports suggest that hundreds of gallons of industrial chemicals were released by GKN Aerospace through a Boeing wastewater treatment plant on June 25 and June 26—and to make matters worse, the more toxic hexavalent chromium was also discharged as a pollutant.”
He continued,
“The community deserves clear answers from the EPA about this latest incident, and precisely what it plans to do about it. At your office’s earliest convenience, please contact my staff to schedule a briefing regarding this matter.”
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the Coldwater Creek community. Most recently, Senator Hawley’s
Justice for Jana Elementary Act of 2023
mandating the clean up of Jana Elementary School and radioactive waste testing be performed at the surrounding buildings in the Hazelwood School District, passed in the Senate. Companion legislation has since been
introduced
in the House of Representatives.

The Honorable Michael S. Regan
Administrator
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20460
Dear Administrator Regan:
Last week, your agency responded to a chemical spill near St. Louis Lambert Airport and Coldwater Creek. While the EPA originally stated that approximately 1,000 gallons of wastewater, contaminated with trivalent chromium, may have made its way into the creek area on June 27, subsequent reports have provided additional information. These new reports suggest that hundreds of gallons of industrial chemicals were released by GKN Aerospace through a Boeing wastewater treatment plant on June 25 and June 26—and to make matters worse, the more toxic hexavalent chromium was also discharged as a pollutant.
This incident will undoubtedly concern Missouri residents living in the vicinity of Coldwater Creek. Residents have expressed to my office that they were not notified of the spill and the facts surrounding it immediately. That same Coldwater Creek area has long suffered from persistent radioactive contamination, which other federal agencies have refused to properly remediate—most recently in the case of Jana Elementary School. This recent incident appears to be merely the latest episode in the ongoing issue of contamination in this area. The community deserves clear answers from the EPA about this latest incident, and precisely what it plans to do about it.
At your office’s earliest convenience, please contact my staff to schedule a briefing regarding this matter. Please come prepared to address the following questions:
How much time elapsed between EPA’s learning of this incident and EPA’s notification to the public of any associated risks from this contamination?
What, if any, remedial measures have GKN Aerospace and/or Boeing committed to the EPA that they will take in response to this incident?
What, if any, health risks does this spill pose for the population of St. Louis, including those near Coldwater Creek? Will you commit to informing the public of any risks in a timely manner?
I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Braun Slam Biden Administration for Failure to Release All Information on COVID-19 Origins, Demand Full Report
Date: Tuesday, June 27, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.)
sent a letter
to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, after the Director and the Biden Administration failed to comply with the Senators’
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023,
by releasing an incomplete report on the origins of COVID-19 well beyond the statutory deadline. The Senators
demanded
that Director Haines provide a new, complete report including any and all information pertaining to the origins of COVID-19, within seven days.
“On March 20, President Biden signed the
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, which we introduced in the Senate to help get to the truth about China and COVID-19,”
the Senators wrote.
“That law required the Director of National Intelligence to ‘declassify any and all information’ relating to links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origin of COVID-19. It also required that you ‘submit to Congress’ all of this information ‘not later than 90 days’ after the law’s enactment. You failed to comply with both requirements.”
They continued,
“You—and the rest of the Administration—appear to be refusing to provide information about China’s role in and responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic in order to avoid upsetting Beijing. We invite you to try again. Within 7 business days, provide to Congress documentation that fully complies with the letter of the law to disclose ‘any and all information’ related to the origins of COVID-19 and a lab leak with minimal redactions.”
On Monday, March 20, 2023, President Biden
signed
into law Senator Hawley’s
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023. It was
re-introduced
in February of this year and
unanimously
passed in the Senate that same week. The bill was originally
introduced
in April 2021 and unanimously
passed
the Senate in May 2021.

June 27, 2023
The Honorable Avril Haines
Director of National Intelligence
Office of the Director of National Intelligence
Washington, D.C. 20511
Dear Director Haines:
On March 20, President Biden signed the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, which we introduced in the Senate to help get to the truth about China and COVID-19. That law required the Director of National Intelligence to “declassify any and all information” relating to links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origin of COVID-19. It also required that you “submit to Congress” all of this information “not later than 90 days” after the law’s enactment.
You failed to comply with both requirements. The deadline was June 18, 2023. Well past the statutory deadline, your office published a declassified report after business hours on June 23. And the report itself was a paltry five pages of information, plus a cover page and appendix. Obviously, the U.S. government is in possession of more information than that. This half-baked effort falls woefully short of the statutory requirements and undermines congressional intent.
Your failure to comply with the law is especially worrisome in light of recent events. The Biden administration, including ODNI, has exhibited a concerning level of deference towards China, including obfuscating the extent of China’s intelligence cooperation with Cuba and downplaying the seriousness of China’s intelligence collection activities over U.S. airspace. You—and the rest of the Administration—appear to be refusing to provide information about China’s role in and responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic in order to avoid upsetting Beijing.
We invite you to try again. Within 7 business days, provide to Congress documentation that fully complies with the letter of the law to disclose “any and all information” related to the origins of COVID-19 and a lab leak with minimal redactions. If you fail to do so, we would welcome your testimony before Congress on this matter so you may answer questions under oath. The American people deserve to know the truth about China’s role in the origins of COVID-19.

Title: Hawley Demands Oversight Hearing After Biden Energy Secretary’s False Statements About Holding Stocks
Date: Thursday, June 22, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) yesterday, urging him to schedule an
oversight hearing
to investigate the false statements Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm
admitted
to making to Senator Hawley during an April committee
hearing. During the hearing, Secretary Granholm claimed she did not own any personal financial stocks, when in fact, she held individual stocks as recently as May of this year.
“I write in response to Secretary Granholm’s letter to the committee dated June 9, 2023 admitting that she made false statements concerning her ownership of individual stocks,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“Secretary Granholm needs to return to the committee to correct the record and clarify her compliance—and the entire Department’s compliance—with federal ethics laws. I urge you to schedule an oversight hearing as soon as practicable to investigate this matter.”
He continued,
“These latest revelations come in the context of an Energy Department that has been reported to have serious, systemic problems with ethics compliance when it comes to stock ownership and conflicts of interest. I therefore urge you to convene a hearing with Secretary Granholm to discuss both Secretary’s false testimony and the steps the Department is taking to ensure senior officials properly comply with federal ethics laws.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary Granholm demanding an explanation for the misleading statements she made to him during the April committee hearing.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
June 21, 2023
The Honorable Joe Manchin
Chairman
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
United States Senate
Washington, 20510
Chairman Manchin:
I write in response to Secretary Granholm’s letter to the committee dated June 9, 2023 admitting that she made false statements concerning her ownership of individual stocks. Secretary Granholm needs to return to the committee to correct the record and clarify her compliance—and the entire Department’s compliance—with federal ethics laws. I urge you to schedule an oversight hearing as soon as practicable to investigate this matter.
Shortly after Secretary Granholm assumed office, Ranking Member Barrasso raised concerns with the Department of Energy Inspector General about her conflicts of interest. Later that year, Secretary Granholm violated conflict of interest laws by improperly disclosing her stock sales. According to reports, she sold $240,000 in stock in April 2021 and October 2021 but failed to disclose these trades until December 2021—after the deadline set by federal law. Then, earlier this year, a Wall Street Journal investigation found that “hundreds of Energy Department officials hold stocks related to agency’s work despite warnings.” This has prompted some of us to develop legislation and conduct oversight of energy officials’ conflicts of interest.
On April 20, Secretary Granholm appeared before this committee. In light of these various reports, I specifically asked her “Do you own individual stocks?” She testified, “No, I’m invested in mutual funds.” She repeated this line twice more. In total, she told this committee three times that she did not own any individual stocks.
But now she tells us that was not true. On June 9, she notified the committee that, contrary to her testimony, she did in fact hold stock in at least six individual companies on April 20. She then divested from these holdings on May 18. But she elected not to apprise this committee of her misstatement or her stock transactions until this month—seven weeks after the hearing and three weeks after she sold her stocks.
The facts of Secretary Granholm’s case are disturbing. How do you not know that you own stocks in individual companies? How do you not verify this after you were caught violating ethics laws the first time? And why did she wait seven weeks to correct the record? These latest revelations come in the context of an Energy Department that has been reported to have serious, systemic problems with ethics compliance when it comes to stock ownership and conflicts of interest. I therefore urge you to convene a hearing with Secretary Granholm to discuss both Secretary’s false testimony and the steps the Department is taking to ensure senior officials properly comply with federal ethics laws.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: ‘Any Man Could’ve Walked Into Our Locker Room,’ Riley Gaines Recounts to Senator Hawley
Date: Wednesday, June 21, 2023

Content:
Today in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
questioned
Riley Gaines, decorated collegiate swimmer and female sports advocate. Gaines described to Senator Hawley her experiences competing against a transgender athlete, and the trauma she and her teammates endured when their privacy was invaded by being forced to undress in front of a biological male.
“You were talking about just the incredible surprise, shall I say to put it gently, of finding a biological man, a 6-foot-4 biological man, in your locker room and having to accept that without being asked about it, without being told about it even. What was that like for you—tell us about that,”
said Senator Hawley.
“I—again we only became aware we would be undressing next to a man was when we had to see a man undressing while we were simultaneously undressing,”
Gaines responded.
According to Gaines, an NCAA official told her Lia Thomas was allowed in the female locker room due to a rule change that made the facilities ‘unisex.’
“And so I’m thinking to myself in these brief moments, first and foremost, you just admitted this is a male by acknowledging how you had to change your rules to make the locker rooms unisex. You acknowledged that we do not share the same sex, first and foremost,”
Gaines continued.
“Secondly, unisex—
any man could’ve walked into our locker room, any coach, any official, any man who wanted to would have had full reigns to and bare minimum we weren’t forewarned about it—and that’s the traumatizing part.
Of course the experience in and of the locker room itself is traumatizing, but I think for me, it was so easy for them to dismiss our rights to privacy.”

Title: Hawley and Braun Demand Biden Implement COVID Origins Act

U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) have
sent a letter
to President Biden demanding he implement the
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, and declassify and release all information related to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We introduced the
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023
earlier this Congress to hold China accountable for its obfuscation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,”
wrote the Senators. “The American people deserve to know how this pandemic began, and their democratically elected representatives have expressed their will unanimously.”
In March, Senator Hawley’s
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023

June 14, 2023
The Honorable Joseph R. Biden
President of the United States
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear President Biden:
We write today to urge the swift and complete implementation of the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, which Congress unanimously passed, and which you signed into law on March 20, 2023.
As you know, the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023 requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to “declassify any and all information” relating to links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origin of COVID-19 within 90 days of the law’s enactment. That deadline, June 18, 2023, is fast approaching. Your Administration has not yet provided any indication of when the relevant material will be declassified.
Importantly, the Act further requires the Director to transmit “all of the information” to Congress, with one very narrow exception. The Act does not allow for redactions based on your Administration’s view of “national security” broadly defined, as you claimed in your signing statement. Rather, the Act only provides for much narrower redactions to protect intelligence sources and methods. Your Administration should comply with the law as written and not undermine clear congressional intent to provide as much transparency to the American people as possible.
We introduced the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023 earlier this Congress to hold China accountable for its obfuscation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. From the beginning of the pandemic, China appears to have taken every effort to hide COVID’s origins from the world. The American people deserve to know how this pandemic began, and their democratically elected representatives have expressed their will unanimously. We urge you not to stand in their way.

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Consumers and Deny AI Companies Section 230 Immunity
Date: Wednesday, June 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – the Ranking Member and the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, respectively – introduced the
No Section 230 Immunity for AI Act.
This new
bipartisan legislation
would clarify that Section 230 immunity will not apply to claims based on generative AI, ensuring consumers have the tools they need to protect themselves from harmful content produced by the latest advancements in AI technology.
For example, AI-generated “deepfakes” – lifelike false images of real individuals – are exploding in popularity. Ordinary people can now suffer life-destroying consequences for saying things they never said, or doing things they never would. Companies complicit in this process should be held accountable in court.
“We can’t make the same mistakes with generative AI as we did with Big Tech on Section 230,”
said Senator Hawley.
“When these new technologies harm innocent people, the companies must be held accountable. Victims deserve their day in court and this bipartisan proposal will make that a reality.”
“AI companies should be forced to take responsibility for business decisions as they’re developing products—without any Section 230 legal shield,”
said Senator Blumenthal.
“This legislation is the first step in our effort to write the rules of AI and establish safeguards as we enter this new era. AI platform accountability is a key principle of a framework for regulation that targets risk and protects the public.”
The
No Section 230 Immunity for AI Act
would:
Amend Section 230 by adding a clause that strips immunity from AI companies in civil claims or criminal prosecutions involving the use or provision of generative AI.
Empower Americans harmed by generative AI models to sue AI companies in federal or state court.
Read the full bill text
here.
On May 16, 2023, Senators Hawley and Blumenthal held a
landmark hearing
on AI oversight. All three witnesses at that hearing, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, agreed that Congress needed to take action, as new developments in generative AI technology – from large language models to art generators – are advancing at a breakneck pace, upending many aspects of American life.
Last week, Senator Hawley
announced
five guiding principles for the future of AI legislation.

Title: Hawley, Peters Bill to Improve and Protect Rural Hospitals’ Cybersecurity Advances in Senate
Date: Wednesday, June 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, cosponsored by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Senator Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), passed through committee and now heads to the Senate floor.
This legislation was
originally introduced
in May 2023. It addresses the critical need for skilled cybersecurity professionals and digital security enhancement protocols in rural healthcare settings.
In March, HSGAC members held a
hearing
that identified rural healthcare facilities as soft targets for cybercriminals. Unlike larger urban hospitals, rural hospitals often have little to no full-time cybersecurity personnel and are particularly exposed to cyberattacks.
The number of attacks on U.S. hospitals each year
doubled
between 2016 and 2021. The threat of ineffective cybersecurity at rural hospitals is evidenced by multiple recent incidents in Missouri, including one in September 2021 at
Missouri Delta Medical Center
in Sikeston, MO and a similar attack in December 2022, at
Fitzgibbon Hospital
in Marshall, MO. Additionally, a rural Illinois hospital recently became the first health care facility to publicly
announce
it would close its doors due to the consequences of a cyberattack.
“I am encouraged Congress is taking bipartisan action to shore up the ability of small-town hospitals to defend themselves from cyberattacks,”
said Senator Hawley. “We must continue working diligently to improve cybersecurity preparedness in rural hospitals to both protect the sensitive medical and personal data of American patients and defend our national security.”
“Ransomware attacks against hospitals and health care systems that compromise sensitive medical information and disrupt patient care must be stopped. Unfortunately, small and rural hospitals often lack the resources to invest in cybersecurity defenses and staff to prevent these breaches,”
said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan legislation will require the federal government to ensure our most vulnerable health care providers have the necessary tools to protect patient information and provide lifesaving care even as criminal hackers continue to target their networks.”
The
Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act
would:
Require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director to develop a comprehensive rural hospital cybersecurity workforce development strategy that, at a minimum, considers public-private partnerships, development of curricula and training resources, and policy recommendations.
Require the CISA Director to create instructional materials for rural hospitals to train staff on fundamental cybersecurity measures.
Require the Secretary of Homeland Security to report annually to HSGAC and the House Committee on Homeland Security with updates regarding the strategy and any programs that have been implemented pursuant to the strategy.

The Honorable Jennifer Granholm

U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Ave, S.W.

Secretary Granholm:
I write in response to your letter dated June 9, 2023 to the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources admitting that you misled the committee and, in particular, misled me about your compliance with federal ethics laws and your conflicts of interest regarding stock holdings. These alarming new revelations demand an immediate and complete explanation from you.
As you know, in January 2022, news reports indicated that you violated federal conflict of interest laws by improperly disclosing stock sales. Then earlier this year, an investigation by the Wall Street Journal reported that “hundreds of Energy Department officials hold stocks related to agency’s work despite warnings.” When you testified before the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources in April, I asked you point blank: “Do you own individual stocks?” You responded: “No, I’m invested in mutual funds.” When I pressed you about reports that you had violated stock disclosure laws nine times, you responded that you had missed a filing deadline for stocks that you had previously owned. I asked for clarity: “You don’t own any individual stock now, so maybe you did when you first came, and you converted them to mutual funds?” You responded: “Yea, it totally was the sale of what I had, because I’m not owning individual stocks.” Three times you told me, and this committee, that you did not own individual stocks.
But we now know that was false. Last Friday, you informed the committee that you did own stocks at the time of your testimony on April 20, 2023. In fact, you still held stocks in six companies. You then divested from these holdings on May 18, 2023. But you chose not to notify the committee until last Friday—over seven weeks after the hearing and at least three weeks after you sold these stocks. So I want to know: why?
So that Congress can consider further action concerning your compliance with federal ethics laws, please provide the following information by June 20, 2023.
Why did you not immediately notify the committee to correct the record on your false testimony?
Why did it take you four weeks to sell your remaining individual stocks?
Why did it take you over three weeks to notify the committee of that sale?
Why did you elect not to sell all of your individual stocks when you assumed office?
In addition, within 30 days, please provide the Committee and my office a complete list of all of your individual stock transactions over the past 10 years for an evaluation of any additional conflicts of interest.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Announces Guiding Principles for Future AI Legislation
Date: Wednesday, June 07, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced his guiding principles for the future of American artificial intelligence (AI) legislation. Senator Hawley’s principles seek to protect Americans’ privacy as AI continues to develop at a pace that threatens to upend many aspects of American life.
“Congress can and should act to protect Americans’ privacy, stave off the harms of unchecked AI development, insulate kids from harmful impacts, and keep this valuable technology out of the hands of our adversaries,”
said Senator Hawley. “Taken together, these five principles will help set the course for the responsible development of American AI.”
To guide future federal action, Senator Hawley proposed five guiding principles:
First, create private rights of action.
Individual citizens should have the right to sue companies for harm inflicted by AI models in order to hold those corporations developing AI accountable.
Second, protect personal data. AI models should be prohibited from harvesting sensitive personal data without consent, with stiff penalties for misuse.
Third, enforce age limits on use.
To shield minors from harmful effects of generative AI technology, companies should be proactively blocked from deploying or promoting these models to children.
Fourth, block technology to and from China.
America should promote AI independence by blocking any importation of AI-related chips and technology from China, and by preventing American corporations from aiding China’s development of AI.
Fifth, establish a licensing system.
To protect consumers and promote transparency, require generative entities working on generative AI models to obtain a license.
In May, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, Senator Hawley held a hearing with Chairman Richard Blumenthal to conduct oversight on AI technology and appropriate safeguards.
During the hearing, Senator Hawley questioned Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, and asked the witnesses if we need to “strike that balance between technological innovation and our ethical and moral responsibility to humanity.” The witnesses agreed that oversight from Congress is needed to protect the American people.
Continuing efforts to protect Americans from AI, Senators Hawley and Blumenthal
sent a letter
yesterday to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, seeking information about the “leak” of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) program.

Title: Hawley and Blumenthal Demand Answers from Meta, Warn of Misuse After ‘Leak’ of Meta’s AI Model
Date: Tuesday, June 06, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ranking Member and Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law,
wrote a new letter
to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, seeking information about the “leak” of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) program.
While Meta originally only purported to release the program to approved researchers within the AI community, the company’s vetting and safeguards appear to have been minimal and the full model appeared online within days, making the model, “available to anyone, anywhere in the world, without monitoring or oversight,”
the Senators wrote.
In the letter, Hawley and Blumenthal warned that there were “seemingly minimal” protections in Meta’s “unrestrained and permissive” release, and the company “appears to have failed to conduct any meaningful risk assessment in advance of release, despite the realistic potential for broad distribution, even if unauthorized.”
Citing these concerns, the Senators pressed Meta for answers on how the company assessed the risk of releasing LLaMA, what steps were taken to prevent the abuse of the model, and how Meta is updating policies and practices based on its unrestrained availability.
The letter follows Hawley and Blumenthal’s
subcommittee hearing
last month, which included testimony from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, IBM Chief Privacy & Trust Officer Christina Montgomery, and NYU Professor Gary Marcus.
Read the full letter
here
and below.
June 6, 2023
Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer
1 Hacker Way
Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,
We write with concern over the “leak” of Meta’s AI model, the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and the potential for its misuse in spam, fraud, malware, privacy violations, harassment, and other wrongdoing and harms. As a part of the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, & the Law’s work on artificial intelligence (AI), we are writing to request information on how your company assessed the risk of releasing LLaMA, what steps were taken to prevent the abuse of the model, and how you are updating your policies and practices based on its unrestrained availability.
In February 2023, Meta released LLaMA, an advanced large language model (LLM) capable of generating compelling text results, similar to products released by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI. Unlike others, Meta released LLaMA for download by approved researchers, rather than centralizing and restricting access to the underlying data, software, and model. Meta explained this decision as helping efforts to advance AI research in order to “improve their robustness and mitigate known issues, such as bias, toxicity, and the potential for generating misinformation.” While LLaMA was reportedly trained on public data, it differed from past models available to the public based on its size and sophistication. Regrettably, but predictably, within days of the announcement, the full model appeared on BitTorrent, making it available to anyone, anywhere in the world, without monitoring or oversight. The open dissemination of LLaMA represents a significant increase in the sophistication of the AI models available to the general public, and raises serious questions about the potential for misuse or abuse.
Open source software and open data can be an extraordinary resource for furthering science, fostering technical standards, and facilitating transparency. Many experts compellingly argue that open access to these models can help the development of safeguards through exposing vulnerabilities to a larger community who can find fixes. As Meta noted when releasing LLaMA, there is a need for “more research that needs to be done to address the risks of bias, toxic comments, and hallucinations in large language models.” Providing the full model allows the types of research, testing, and collaborative development that are not as readily achievable within closed systems like OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google Bard. Additionally, as AI becomes more important to technological growth and competition between consumer platforms, the centralization of AI expertise and technical capabilities risks stifling innovation and market competition, and threatens to further entrench incumbent tech firms. Open source AI can play a meaningful role in making sure that AI systems are robust and safe, and that the field of AI is not dominated by a few select corporations.
On the other hand, even in the short time that generative AI tools have been available to the public, they have been dangerously abused — a risk that is further exacerbated with open source models. For example, after Stability AI launched its open source art generator, Stable Diffusion, it was used to create violent and sexual images, including pornographic deep fakes of real people, which disproportionately feature women 96% of the time. Even OpenAI’s closed model, ChatGPT, has been misused to create malware and phishing campaigns, financial fraud, and obscene content involving children. At least at this stage of technology’s development, centralized AI models can be more effectively updated and controlled to prevent and respond to abuse compared to open source AI models.
Adding to this risk, Meta appears to have done little to restrict the model from responding to dangerous or criminal tasks. For example, when asked to “write a note pretending to be someone’s son asking for money to get out of a difficult situation,” OpenAI’s ChatGPT will deny the request based on its ethical guidelines. In contrast, LLaMA will produce the letter requested, as well as other answers involving self-harm, crime, and antisemitism. While the full scope of possible abuse of LLaMA remains to be seen, already the model has been utilized to generate profiles and automate conversations on Tinder and a chatbot built from LLaMA, Stanford’s Alpaca AI, was taken down shortly after release over providing incorrect information and troubling responses. It is easy to imagine LLaMA being adopted by spammers and those engaged in cybercrime. While centralized models can adapt to abuse and vulnerabilities, open source AI models like LLaMA, once released to the public, will always be available to bad actors who are always willing to engage in high-risk tasks, including fraud, obscene material involving children, privacy intrusions, and other crime.
Meta’s choice to distribute LLaMA in such an unrestrained and permissive manner raises important and complicated questions about when and how it is appropriate to openly release sophisticated AI models. Given the seemingly minimal protections built into LLaMA’s release, Meta should have known that LLaMA would be broadly disseminated, and must have anticipated the potential for abuse. While Meta has described the release as a leak, its chief AI scientist has stated that open models are key to its commercial success. Unfortunately, Meta appears to have failed to conduct any meaningful risk assessment in advance of release, despite the realistic potential for broad distribution, even if unauthorized. Stunningly, in the model card and release paper for LLaMA, Meta appears not to have even considered the ethical implication of its public release. It provides sparse details about its testing or steps to prevent for abuse, aside from technical measurements of bias. The dearth of information is particularly stark in comparison to the more extensive documentation released by OpenAI in connection with its closed models, ChatGPT and GPT-4. By purporting to release LLaMA for the purpose of researching the abuse of AI, Meta effectively appears to have put a powerful tool in the hands of bad actors to actually engage in such abuse without much discernable forethought, preparation, or safeguards.
As Congress considers legislation and oversight to promote both innovation and accountability in the commercialization and use of AI, it is important to understand how companies are assessing and mitigating the risks associated with AI models. Meta has held itself out a leader on AI, and is under a Federal Trade Commission consent decree and other scrutiny over the safety of its platform. While Meta’s stated intention of promoting safety research may have merit, the lack of thorough, public consideration of the ramifications of its foreseeable widespread dissemination is a disservice to the public. It is important to better understand how Meta evaluated this risk and what changes it plans to make after this matter.
Given the seriousness and scope of LLaMA’s public availability, we respectfully write to ask you to answer the following questions by June 15, 2023:
What risk assessments, if any, were conducted regarding the likelihood and repercussions of dissemination of LLaMA to anyone other than its authorized recipients prior to Meta’s release of the model to researchers?
a.  How many researchers did Meta approve to have access to LLaMA’s       model weights? What criteria was used in the selection and vetting of the      approved researchers?
b.  What specific technical and administrative safeguards did Meta implement      in connection with its release of LLaMA to prevent the public      dissemination of the model?
c.  How did Meta balance this risk against its stated goal of helping foster AI      safety research?
d.  Who was consulted inside and outside of Meta about this risk, and how      was the decision made to release Meta to researchers?
e.  What other safety or security measures were contemplated to protect      against the public dissemination of LLaMA?
What steps has Meta taken since the release of LLaMA to prevent or mitigate damage caused by the dissemination of its AI model?
a.  What steps has Meta taken to track the distribution, repurposing, and end      use of LLaMA, including its potential misuse in fraud and spam campaigns      targeting users on its platforms? Please provide any documentation of      these efforts and findings, including any DMCA takedown notices, cease      and desist letters, or similar efforts.
What steps were taken during and after the training process for LLaMA to ensure that the model could not be abused after it was released, for example, steps taken to prevent responses that could be used in fraud schemes, self-harm, and cybercrime?
Has Meta made changes to its policies, practices, and plans concerning around the sharing of AI models and other data based on the dissemination of LLaMA? If so, what changes were made and what lessons has Meta learned from it?
Has Meta considered alternative approaches toward working with researchers, enhancing the security of its models, or preventing them from falling in the hands of malicious actors, such as providing access through an API or allowing the model to be run in a more limited sandbox provided by Meta? Under what conditions does Meta consider it necessary to provide full access to AI models, despite the risk of release?
Has Meta developed policies or guidelines for when it believes that AI models should not be available to the public, for example limiting access when a model is highly capable of performing particular tasks or based on the model’s parameter size?
Overall, how does Meta evaluate the risks and precautions that should be taken prior to the public release of a sophisticated AI model? Can this documentation be shared with the public in a form similar to the system card OpenAI shared for GPT-4?
The LLaMA research paper asserted that no proprietary or inaccessible data was used to train the model. Was LLaMA trained in any way on any data that it obtained or that derived from any of Meta’s customers, such as posts, content or any other data created or provided by users of Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp?
Meta has significant access to its users’ personal information and uses that data for AI systems, such as those used in advertising. When does Meta use its users’ personal data for AI research, including AI models that are available to the public or outside researchers?
Thank you for your attention to these important issues. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator
Richard Blumenthal

Title: Hawley Delivers Floor Speech Urging Support for His Amendment to Increase Tariffs on China
Date: Friday, June 02, 2023

Content:
This evening U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks ahead of the Senate’s vote on his amendment, as part of the debt ceiling deal, to raise tariffs on imports from China until the United States’ unsustainable trade deficit with China comes into balance.
“In the last 20 years in the state of Missouri, we have lost 60,000 jobs to the People’s Republic of China—that number nationwide is almost 4 million,”
said Senator Hawley. “We can talk about budget reforms, and we can talk about savings here and there, but until we do the work of bringing back productive capacity to this nation and good-paying, blue-collar jobs you can raise a family on, we will not put our economy on the basis that we need to address the economic challenges that we face.”
In May, Senator Hawley introduced the
Raising Tariffs on Imports from China Act
which would require the President to impose an additional tariff of 25% on all goods imported from China if a bilateral deficit is recorded during the preceding calendar year.
In March, Senator Hawley introduced the
Ending Normal Trade Relations with China Act, legislation that would revoke China’s normal trade relations status and subject imports from China to a higher base tariff rate.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on his intent to vote ‘no’ on the debt ceiling deal.
“On the debt ceiling, my view is the most important deficit we face is the trade deficit with China. Every dollar represents jobs lost (60k & counting in Missouri), industry lost, communities decimated. We’ve got to quit making China rich & get good blue-collar jobs back in USA. This deal doesn’t do that. So I’m a no,”
said Senator Hawley.

Title: Hawley Co-Chairs A.I. Judiciary Subcommittee Hearing, Raises Concerns about Election Integrity and Company Liability
Date: Tuesday, May 16, 2023

Content:
Today in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law hearing on oversight of artificial intelligence (A.I.), U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ranking Member of the subcommittee, questioned leaders in the A.I. space, including Sam Altman, Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI.
“Will we strike that balance between technological innovation and our ethical and moral responsibility to humanity, to liberty, to the freedom of this country? I hope that today’s hearing will take us a step closer to that answer,”
said Senator Hawley during his opening statement.
Senator Hawley questioned witnesses about A.I.’s infringement on consumer privacy, potential manipulation of personal behavior and opinions, and threats to election integrity.
“I want to think about this in the context of elections,”
said Senator Hawley.
” […] Should we be concerned about models that can, large language models, that can predict survey opinion and then can help organizations, entities fine tune strategies to elicit behaviors from voters? Should we be worried about this for our elections?”
Sam Altman replied,
“Thank you Senator Hawley for the question. It’s one of my areas of greatest concern.”
Later in the hearing, Senator Hawley called for the creation of laws enabling consumers harmed by A.I. to bring litigation against companies.
“Why don’t we just let people sue you? Why don’t we just make you liable in court? We can do that—we know how to do that,”
said Senator Hawley.
“We can pass a statute—we can create a federal right of action that will allow private individuals who are harmed by this technology to get into court?”

Title: NEW: Hawley Outlines Missouri Priorities for Upcoming Farm Bill
Date: Monday, May 15, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Ranking Member John Boozman (R-Ark.), outlining Missouri’s priorities for Title I and Title XI in the upcoming 2023 Farm Bill. These include the preservation of a strong farm safety net in light of high input prices and changing market conditions. Senator Hawley will continue to work in the Senate to advocate for the interests of Missouri’s farmers and ranchers during the Farm Bill process.
“The upcoming farm bill reauthorization provides a unique opportunity to strengthen our rural economy. As you begin drafting legislative text, I urge you to preserve a strong farm safety net in the 2023 Farm Bill,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“I proudly represent one of the most diverse and productive agriculture states in the country. With 27.8 million acres of farmland production, Missouri farmers are leaders in cattle, corn, soybean, rice, cotton, hay production and more. At 95,000 farms, Missouri has the second highest number of farms in the country. Maintaining funding levels for these programs will help preserve small and mid-sized family farms in my state for generations to come.”
He continued,
“Over the next year, I plan to be actively engaged in the farm bill process to ensure Missouri producers have a seat at the table. I look forward to working with you in the coming months to craft a farm bill that will serve the needs of farmers in my state and across the country.”

The Honorable John Boozman
Ranking Member
U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture
United States Senate
Washington, DC, 20510
Dear Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Boozman,
The upcoming farm bill reauthorization provides a unique opportunity to strengthen our rural economy. As you begin drafting legislative text, I urge you to preserve a strong farm safety net in the 2023 Farm Bill.
I proudly represent one of the most diverse and productive agriculture states in the country. With 27.8 million acres of farmland production, Missouri farmers are leaders in cattle, corn, soybean, rice, cotton, hay production and more. At 95,000 farms, Missouri has the second highest number of farms in the country. Maintaining funding levels for these programs will help preserve small and mid-sized family farms in my state for generations to come.
In the five years since the 2018 Farm Bill was passed, inflation of essential farm inputs has been one of the most pressing issues for Missouri farmers. I share producers’ concerns that current Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) calculations do not reflect market conditions. For some commodities, PLC reference prices are lower than breakeven costs. This undermines the intent of the commodity price support programs, which is to help farmers navigate volatile market conditions. For this reason, I am supportive of efforts to increase Price Loss Coverage reference prices in the 2023 Farm Bill.
Maintaining crop insurance authorization levels should be a priority for Congress in the 2023 Farm Bill. It may also be necessary to direct the Risk Management Agency to expand starting and final planting dates across all insurable commodities. Farmers are the best equipped to decide when to plant their crops. Current planting dates can be restrictive on farmers in warmer climates. In addition, the next farm bill should not attempt to link crop insurance funding with “climate smart” practices.
Over the next year, I plan to be actively engaged in the farm bill process to ensure Missouri producers have a seat at the table. I look forward to working with you in the coming months to craft a farm bill that will serve the needs of farmers in my state and across the country.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Today during a Senate Judiciary Committee Markup, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) reached an agreement with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) to advance the
STOP CSAM Act, legislation sponsored by Senator Durbin that cracks down on the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online.
With Senator Durbin’s support, the Committee adopted Senator Hawley’s amendment empowering victims to bring civil suits against platforms for knowingly hosting CSAM to better hold tech companies accountable. Senator Hawley also joined the
STOP CSAM Act
as the first Republican co-sponsor of the legislation, which passed the Committee unanimously and now heads to the Senate floor.
“I’ve just become convinced that maybe the only way to get the attention of these platforms is to give individuals the right to get into court,”
said Senator Hawley. “For the first time, [this legislation] will allow victims of this material to get into court and to sue the people who made it, but also those platforms who knowingly hosted.”

Title: Hawley, Peters Introduce Bill to Improve and Protect Rural Hospitals’ Cybersecurity
Date: Thursday, May 11, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) – a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) – and HSGAC Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced the
Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act,
new legislation that addresses the critical need for skilled cybersecurity professionals and digital security enhancement protocols in rural healthcare settings.
This legislation follows a recent HSGAC
hearing
that identified rural healthcare facilities as soft targets for cybercriminals. Unlike larger urban hospitals, rural hospitals often have little to no full-time cybersecurity personnel and are particularly exposed to cyberattacks.
“Congress must take action to shore up the ability of small-town hospitals to defend themselves from cyberattacks,”
said Senator Hawley.
“By working to improve cybersecurity preparedness and develop a robust cybersecurity workforce in rural hospitals, we can help protect the sensitive medical and personal data of American patients and defend our national security.”
“Ransomware attacks against hospitals and health care systems that compromise sensitive medical information and disrupt patient care must be stopped. Unfortunately, small and rural hospitals often lack the resources to invest in cybersecurity defenses and staff to prevent these breaches,”
said Senator Peters.
“This bipartisan legislation will require the federal government to ensure our most vulnerable health care providers have the necessary tools to protect patient information and provide lifesaving care even as criminal hackers continue to target their networks.”
The
Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act
would:
Require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director to develop a comprehensive rural hospital cybersecurity workforce development strategy that, at a minimum, considers public-private partnerships, development of curricula and training resources, and policy recommendations.
Require the CISA Director to create instructional materials for rural hospitals to train staff on fundamental cybersecurity measures.
Require the Secretary of Homeland Security to report annually to HSGAC and the House Committee on Homeland Security with updates regarding the strategy and any programs that have been implemented pursuant to the strategy.

Title: Hawley Calls for Higher Tariffs on China, Trade Deficit Reduction in Debt Limit Deal
Date: Wednesday, May 10, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Raising Tariffs on Imports from China Act,
new legislation to raise tariffs on imports from China until the United States’ unsustainable bilateral trade deficit comes into balance. Senator Hawley is
urging
debt limit talks to include reduction of the trade deficit.
“Under Joe Biden’s leadership, the Administration has failed to confront the structural deficit that matters most – our trade deficit with China,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Now is the time for decisive action to bring our trade back into balance, stop China’s annihilation of American industry, and bring back good-paying American jobs. Strong tariffs on China should be a major part of any debt ceiling agreement.”
Since the United States granted China permanent normal trade relations, our trade deficit has totaled more than
$6 trillion, and has averaged $350 billion per year over the past decade. This has eroded the U.S. industrial base, enriched and empowered our nation’s greatest adversary, and resulted in the loss of 3.82 million good
jobs, including 2.89 million manufacturing jobs.
Senator Hawley’s
Raising Tariffs on Imports from China Act
would:
Direct the President to calculate and publish every year the total value of imports into the United States from China and the total value of exports from the United States to China.
Require the President to impose an additional duty of 25% on all goods imported from China if a bilateral deficit is recorded during the preceding calendar year.
Permit the President to remove the duties if, during the preceding calendar year, the United States records a bilateral surplus with China.

Title: New Hawley Bill Holds Corporations Accountable for Exploiting Biden’s Child Smuggling and Labor Crisis
Date: Wednesday, May 03, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Corporate Responsibility for Child Labor Elimination Act, new legislation that would compel large corporations to eradicate unlawful child labor, fueled by Biden’s border crisis, from their operations in the United States.
Recent
investigative
reporting
has documented an explosive growth of migrant child labor in the United States and found evidence of unlawful child labor in the supply chains of some of America’s largest corporations.
“Joe Biden’s open-border policies have created the biggest human smuggling and child labor operation in history. Large corporations are turning a blind eye to the crisis and exploiting it for their own gain,”
said Senator Hawley.
“If the administration won’t act to protect kids, Congress must. This legislation compels large corporations to eradicate child labor in their work place and holds those accountable who fail to act.”
Senator Hawley’s
Corporate Responsibility for Child Labor Elimination Act
would:
Compel large corporations to disclose the steps they are taking to eradicate unlawful child labor in their workforce.
Direct these companies to undergo independent audits on an annual basis to ensure they are not complicit in unlawful child labor, including through their suppliers and on-site service providers in the United States.
Require these companies to submit the results of the audits to the Department of Labor (DOL) and also make them publicly available. The DOL will report to Congress those covered companies found to be complicit in unlawful child labor.
Obligate CEOs to certify that their supply chains are free of unlawful child labor and that they have reported all instances of unlawful child labor in their company’s supply chain.
Assess financial penalties on companies that evade the audit requirements, retaliate against workers, or fail to certify that their supply chain is free of unlawful child labor.

Background:
Last week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray demanding a full-scale effort be made to locate the nearly 85,000 migrant children that have gone missing under the Biden administration, while also bringing any child labor criminals holding them in modern-day slavery to justice.
Last month, in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Hawley
questioned
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, slamming the Biden Administration after reports revealing a sharp rise in trafficking and abuse of migrant children under his leadership.

Lieutenant General Michael A. Loh
Director, Air National Guard
3500 Fetchet Avenue
Andrews AFB, MD 20762-5157
Dear Lieutenant General Loh,
We were recently informed that the 139th Airlift Wing has been selected to move forward to the next step of the C-130J basing decision process. In light of this announcement, we write in full support of transferring eight C-130Js to the 139th Airlift Wing (139th AW) at Rosecrans Air National Guard Base in Saint Joseph, Missouri.
The 139th AW at Rosecrans Air National Guard Base is host to the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center (AATTC). The AATTC provides all Mobility Air Forces of the U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard—along with joint partners in the U.S. Marine Corps and at least 17 allies and partners—with advanced airlift tactics and training. No other Air National Guard Base under consideration for this C-130J basing action boasts this unique asset. The 139th AW also has a long record of successful wartime deployments and regularly contributes to domestic and homeland security needs, including in response to natural disasters.
The 139th AW currently performs the above missions using older C-130H models. Upgrading the current fleet of C-130Hs to the new C-130J models would not only improve the unit’s ability to meet current and projected operational requirements, including Agile Combat Employment, but would also improve its ability to respond to domestic requirements. Importantly, 139th AW’s central position in the Continental United States allows it to rapidly deploy across the country. Furthermore, the 139th AW is the only Air National Guard airlift unit with the capability to respond locally in the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region 7, which includes Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska.
The 139th AW has continued to maintain and modernize its infrastructure, ensuring that it is well- postured to receive C-130J aircraft now and for decades to come. For example, through new land lease sales, base development, and a new runway, the unit is already positioned to have the capacity and resources necessary for the delivery of C-130J aircrafts. The 139th AW also has recorded higher flying hour allocation than any other C130H unit for Fiscal Year 2023. All of this reaffirms what we have long known to be true—that no other unit in the Air National Guard is better situated to accept the C-130J aircraft than the 139th Airlift Wing at Rosecrans Air National Guard Base.
As final basing decisions for the transfer of C-130J aircraft approach, we thank you again for your continued consideration of the 139th AW to receive the C-130J. Basing these aircraft at Rosecrans Air National Guard base will solidify the continued success of the 139th AW in service of our country.
Thank you for your service to our nation and the United States Air Force.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Stefanik Push for Answers from U.S. Military about Participation in TikTok Ad
Date: Tuesday, May 02, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (NY-21) have
sent a letter
to Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, demanding answers for an Air National Guardsman’s participation in a recent advertisement on TikTok that appears to serve as a de facto National Guard endorsement of a Chinese-controlled platform.
The TikTok advertisement features a member of the Air National Guard expressing his support for and use of TikTok.
In the video, the Servicemember explains how he personally uses this platform from the perspective of his military service and that it “allows [him] to reach the military community.”
Senator Hawley and Congresswoman Stefanik wrote, “This is extremely concerning given the known threats TikTok poses to Americans-especially so as TikTok is now banned on all U.S. Government devices.”
They continued, “Not only does TikTok play a leading role in manipulating American citizens’ perceptions of China generally, but influence operations like this could directly undermine the National Guard’s ability to mobilize in crisis or conflict. […] Both TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party continue to actively undermine American interests, both in the Indo-Pacific and in the American homeland, that the National Guard is tasked to defend.”
In January, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
to prohibit TikTok from operating in the United States and ban commercial activity with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.
In December 2022, Senator Hawley’s
No TikTok on Government Devices
was
signed into law
effectively banning the Chinese app on all federal devices – including those belonging to the Department of Defense.

April 28, 2023
General Daniel Hokanson
Chief National Guard Bureau
111 S George Mason Drive Arlington VA 22204
Dear General Hokanson,
We write to express our concern over a recent TikTok advertisement featuring an Air National Guardsman expressing his support for, and use of, TikTok. In the advertisement, he immediately identifies himself as a member of the Air National Guard. As a result, the video appears to serve as a de facto National Guard endorsement of TikTok’s platform. This is extremely concerning given the known threats TikTok poses to Americans-especially so as TikTok is now banned on all U.S. Government devices. It is therefore imperative that the National Guard Bureau (NGB) clarify its policies on official and unofficial use of TikTok to both Servicemembers and the American people.
Chinese intelligence and security services use TikTok to surveil, exploit, and manipulate the American people. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is a Chinese company and therefore must comply with Article 7 of China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law, which states, “Any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law.” This is especially concerning considering that China-based employees of ByteDance routinely access non-public U.S. user data, despite TikTok’s official statements to the contrary.
The National Guard plays an integral role in carrying out the National Defense Strategy, which correctly identifies China as our most consequential strategic competitor. Not only does TikTok play a leading role in manipulating American citizens’ perceptions of China generally, but influence operations like this could directly undermine the National Guard’s ability to mobilize in crisis or conflict. Additionally, TikTok’s data collection could pose threats to the operational security of National Guard operations. Both TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party continue to actively undermine American interests, both in the Indo-Pacific and in the American homeland, that the National Guard is tasked to defend.
With these concerns in mind, we request answers to the following questions:
Has NGB prohibited use of TikTok on official government devices in accordance with federal law?
Has NGB provided guidance to National Guardsmen about the use of TikTok on personal devices? If so, please share this guidance. If not, please explain why NGB has not provided such guidance to National Guardsmen.
How does NGB mitigate the risk of operational security violations when data collection platforms like TikTok are utilized by Servicemembers in their personal capacity?
How can NGB better communicate benefits offered by the National Guard to current and prospective Guardsmen using platforms other than TikTok?
Please provide these answers in unclassified format no later than May 26, 2023. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley                                     Elise M. Stefanik

Title: Hawley Blasts Biden Interior Secretary For Claims of ‘Too Many’ American Jobs, Selling Out Blue-Collar Workers to China
Date: Tuesday, May 02, 2023

Content:
Today in a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, grilling her for prioritizing the Biden Administration’s radical climate agenda over retaining blue-collar jobs and American energy security.
“Let me just say this — jobs for blue-collar workers in this nation are valuable resources. The livelihood and well-being of American families are valuable resources. The ability of America to have our own industry and not be dependent on China is a valuable resource,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Why should those things, for millions of Americans, be sacrificed in favor of your agenda for radical climate change?”
“Senator, I know that there’s like 1.9 jobs for every American in the country right now, so I know there’s a lot of jobs,”
Secretary Haaland responded.
Senator Hawley continued,
“Wait, you’re telling me that we have too many jobs for blue-collar workers? Have you seen the number of jobs we have lost in this country to China in the last twenty years? Do you know where those jobs come from? Over 3 million jobs have gone to China. Do you know where those jobs have come from? They have come out of midwestern towns like the ones I represent. They are blue-collar workers, and you’re sitting here and telling me that we have too many jobs in this country. Are you serious?”

Title: Hawley Demands FBI Launch Full-Scale Effort to Locate Missing Migrant Children, Bring Child Labor Criminals to Justice
Date: Friday, April 28, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray yesterday, demanding a full-scale effort be made to locate the nearly 85,000 migrant children that have gone missing under the Biden administration, while also bringing any child labor criminals holding them in modern-day slavery to justice.
“According to statistics kept by Customs and Border Protection, some 345,000 children have come across the border unaccompanied since early 2021. We now know tens of thousands of these children have been caught up in massive child smuggling and child labor operations,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“I am sure you have seen recent reports in the New York Times that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has lost touch with as many as 85,000 migrant children. Thousands of these children are now the prey of child labor criminals.”
He continued,
“The FBI must mount a full-scale effort to locate these missing children and to bring to justice the criminals who are holding them in modern-day slavery. The FBI must also investigate HHS and the Department of Homeland Security for their role in facilitating the exploitation of these children, in violation of the law. This issue must be a leading FBI priority.”

The Honorable Christopher A. Wray
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20535
Dear Director Wray:
According to statistics kept by Customs and Border Protection, some 345,000 children have come across the border unaccompanied since early 2021. We now know tens of thousands of these children have been caught up in massive child smuggling and child labor operations. I am sure you have seen recent reports in the New York Times that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has lost touch with as many as 85,000 migrant children. Thousands of these children are now the prey of child labor criminals.
The Biden Administration is morally responsible for their fate. The President lifted Title 42 restrictions on unaccompanied children in early 2021. Reporting reveals that HHS loosened vetting processes for sponsors and retaliated against whistleblowers who raised these concerns. As a result, thousands of children have been handed over to modern-day slave traders. They are forced into factory work under punishing conditions. They are forced to make auto parts, process meat in slaughterhouses, and reroof houses. They are denied food, education, and sometimes fear for their lives. They suffer sexual violence. In a country that claims to value the rule of law and the protection of children, this is unconscionable.
The pervasive maltreatment of migrant children plainly violates both the Fair Labor Standards Act, which prohibits the abuse of underage workers, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which designates human trafficking offenses as federal crimes. The FBI must mount a full-scale effort to locate these missing children and to bring to justice the criminals who are holding them in modern-day slavery. The FBI must also investigate HHS and the Department of Homeland Security for their role in facilitating the exploitation of these children, in violation of the law.
This issue must be a leading FBI priority. Please provide my office with a full report on the whereabouts of these children, and of any prosecutions initiated, no later than May 25, 2023.
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Delivers Speech at the Heritage Foundation Leadership Summit: Conservatives at a Crossroads
Date: Friday, April 21, 2023

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley | April 21, 2023 |
The American Conservative
The following text reflects remarks as prepared for delivery.
Thank you to the Heritage Foundation, which helped inspire my interest in conservative policy twenty-three years ago. I was an intern here in the summer of 2000. What a time to be alive.
[…]
And the truth is: Nobody has done more in the last fifty years to fuel conservative ideas than the Heritage Foundation. And at this time of challenge—in this time for choosing—the Heritage Foundation has never been more important.
I say “choosing” because that’s where we are. A time where we as conservatives must choose what we are about.
It is my conviction: We stand at one of the great crossroads in American history. The decisions that we make in the next five, ten years will determine the shape of the next fifty or 100. And the question is, what will conservatives stand for in this hour?
Do we have what it takes to face the challenges before us? We face a rising adversary in China. We face the loss of industry at home. The unraveling of our social fabric. Falling birth rates. Falling family formation.
But above all other challenges, in my estimation, we face the radical challenge of a new Marxism. Of a new left that seeks to transform American life—to transform practically every institution we cherish, to abolish the traditional family, to rewrite American history, to purge our society of Christian influence and the Bible.
This is the Great Awokening. And my contention to you is that the Republican Party as we know it is not prepared to meet this challenge. The party as we know it must be reformed.
And the question is, can we do it? As conservatives, can we do it? Can we change this party to meet the needs of this hour?
You ask: What needs to change? Well, let me tell you a story. A story in two parts. Here’s part one.
In the 1990s, when I was yet a teenager, the world changed decisively—and so did the Republican Party. Republican leaders embraced a politics of the New World Order. And this change was not for the better.
[…]
No more protection of American manufacturing. No more fostering American industry. No, the priority now was the free movement of capital. Globalism.
The New World Order also meant major changes to our foreign policy. An economic empire required military force to defend it. And America would furnish that military force. The New World Order Republicans wanted America to be a global hegemon—the global hegemon.
[…]
Thirty years on, the verdict is in. The New World Order has failed. The pursuit of economic globalism has failed. The pursuit of empire has failed.
It has cost us shocking sums of money, but that is the least of it. It has fueled the rise of our most serious adversary, China. Most Favored Nation status was a colossal mistake. China has built their military on the backs of our middle class. We have helped them do it.
But worse even than that, the politics of New World Order has cost us a way of life, a working class way of life. The economic policy of the last thirty years has hollowed out American industry. Sent millions of jobs overseas. Blue collar jobs that once provided a good living for a family. The loss of good paying work for working people has meant fewer marriages. Falling birth rates. It has disrupted whole towns and communities.
Which brings me to the second part of my story. The growing threat within. The Great Awokening.
The Soviet Union may have lost the Cold War, but Marx lived on—in the English departments at American universities, and in the law schools. In places like these, a new ideology took root over the last fifty and sixty years that trashed American society as fundamentally corrupt and oppressive.
This new ideology cascaded across American academia and twisted it, but it did not stop there. Instead, it spread like a disease. It was no longer just student radicals. It infected our elite class, our media, our biggest businesses.
[…]
And now—the cultural Marxists have come to power. In the Democratic Party. In the Biden administration. In our schools and universities and government agencies. The new Marxism is the greatest threat to American society in our lifetimes.
But the Republican Party is ill-prepared to meet it. It is ill-positioned. And I would contend to you, in key ways, it has been part of the problem. For decades, Republican policies undermined the very people who are today the most important bulwark against cultural Marxism. I mean the working class, and the working-class way of life.
Ours has been a working-class nation. This country’s culture has been defined by working people.
[…]
A job means independence. Independence means strength. But Republicans helped to steal that strength from working people. Think of this: For much of our history, corporate bosses had to reckon with American worker power. Why? Because they needed workers. In the factories. On the assembly line. On the farms. Because they were needed, the views of workers had to be respected.
But ruinous trade deals, open immigration policies, and corporate consolidation changed all of that. Cheap foreign labor, in many cases slave labor, replaced Americans. Without the same fear of economic disruption that they once had, today cultural Marxists feel free to bully blue-collar workers into submission.
At the same time, Republicans have come to think of “cultural issues” as somehow detached from blue-collar workers and the working-class life. They are not. The only way to turn back the left’s kulturkampf—their culture war—is to strengthen working people.
The only way to rebuild the middle-class consensus is to rebuild the institutions of middle-class life. If Republicans want to save this nation, they must move immediately to higher ground. We must abandon the ruinous politics of the New World Order. It has been a failure across the board, but an unmitigated catastrophe for blue-collar life.
[…]
The whole of our policy—at home and abroad—must be geared to protecting family, neighborhood, church, nation. Abroad, this means an end to liberal imperialism. It means acting for American interests. It means a robustly nationalist foreign policy that deals with our biggest threat, China, and does less elsewhere across the globe. At home, it means a rigorous focus on bringing back industry, bringing back blue-collar jobs that can support a family, and curbing the power of corporate monopolies.
Let’s strip China of normal trade relations. Let’s require our most critical goods be produced in this country. Let’s balance trade. Let’s strengthen Buy America. Let’s break the backs of Big Tech, Big Pharma, and the biggest and most abusive monopolies. We must restore the economic and cultural power of working people. This is how we will save our culture. This is how we will renew our civil society. This is how we will save this nation.

Title: Granholm Expresses Support for Hawley Bills Banning Stock Trading for Members of Congress and Executive Branch Officials
Date: Friday, April 21, 2023

Content:
In a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing yesterday, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm about the troubling
reports
that nearly one-third of the Energy Department’s senior officials or their families owned stocks related to the agency’s work.
At the end of his questioning, Secretary Granholm expressed support Senator Hawley’s
Eliminating Executive Branch Insider Trading Act, which would ban the trading and holding of individual stocks by senior Executive Branch officials. Granholm also expressed support for a stock trading ban for members of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Hawley introduced the
PELOSI Act
to ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks.
“Well I’ll tell you what—I think I’ve got a solution, which is, let’s just ban it. Let’s ban it for all Executive Department officials. Let’s ban it for members of Congress,”
said Senator Hawley.
“How about that?”
“I would not object to that,” responded Secretary Granholm.

“I’ve introduced legislation that would direct the Army Corps to clean up the school, that would direct testing of the entire school district, and create, in the Department of Energy, a fund to clean up schools that are contaminated by Manhattan-era project contamination,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Would you support that legislation?”
“I would,”

Title: Hawley Puts Big Pharma on Notice, Unveils Two New Bills in Patients First Agenda to Cut Drug Costs
Date: Wednesday, April 19, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) unveiled two new bills in his Patients First Agenda to Cut Drug Costs. In addition to Senator Hawley’s already-introduced
Cap Insulin Prices Act, the agenda includes the
Fair Prescription Drug Prices for Americans Act
and the
Ending the Prescription Drug Kickback Act of 2023.
If enacted, his three-part agenda will together target the biggest abuses in the prescription drug market to reduce costs for patients.
“Our prescription drug market is rigged in favor of Big Pharma and Big Insurance and patients are paying the price. Americans foot the bill for the most costly prescription drug prices in the world—all while middlemen negotiate backroom deals to extract financial kickbacks that drive prices further up and prevent lower-cost alternatives,”
said Senator Hawley.
“These conditions inflate prices, strain the budgets of American families, and create unacceptable barriers to care. It’s time to stop subsidizing lower drug costs for foreigners, end Big Insurance’s pay-to-play scheme, and put American patients first.”
The
Fair Prescription Drug Prices for Americans Act
would:
Prohibit pharmaceutical companies from selling a drug in the United States at a higher price than the average price of the drug sold in the other G-7 advanced economies.
Impose stiff civil monetary fines for Big Pharma if they sell a drug at a higher list price in the United States than the average price of the drug sold in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
Background:
The United States pays, by far, the highest prescription drug prices in the world, oftentimes paying two to four times more for the same medication than other nations with advanced economies.
Pharmaceutical companies benefit greatly from America’s robust intellectual property protections, monopoly-status exclusivity periods, and preferential tax treatment—policies that have brought countless prescription drugs to market to the benefit of patients in the United States and across the world. However, as a matter of basic fairness, it is unacceptable that American patients and American taxpayers should be forced to further subsidize Big Pharma by paying more for the same drugs than patients in other nations.
View the full bill text
here.
The
Ending the Prescription Drug Kickback Act of 2023
would:
Entirely prohibit, without exception, prescription drug rebates in both federal health programs like Medicare and private insurance plans, including those intended to influence formulary tier placement or its equivalent.
Restore transparency and fairness to the prescription drug market and put patients on a more level playing field with large corporations.
Background:
For years, Big Insurance has gotten a sweetheart deal from Big Pharma.  Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of health plans. They negotiate “rebates” from drug companies in exchange for favorable coverage of a company’s drugs in health plans—even if cheaper or better alternatives exist.
It’s a sweet deal for Big Insurance, but terrible for patients. It creates a pernicious pay-to-play negotiating dynamic that incentivizes Big Insurance and PBMs to prioritize the value of their kickbacks over the clinical value of the drugs they cover and the total costs paid by patients. Congress must act to ensure that prescription drug markets are more transparent and less susceptible to distortions that place profits over patients.

Title: ‘Why Should You Not Be Impeached?’ Hawley Slams Mayorkas for Spike in Abuse of Migrant Children Under Biden
Date: Tuesday, April 18, 2023

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Garland for False Testimony of DOJ Infiltration in Churches
Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland
demanding answers
for his
false testimony
regarding the Justice Department’s targeting and subsequent arrests of people of faith, particularly Catholics,
last month
in a Senate Judiciary hearing.
“Your Department has decided to turn Catholic congregations into front organizations for the FBI, and when asked about it, you’ve decided to fudge the truth before Congress,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “This is an unconscionable assault on American Catholics’ First Amendment rights and an abdication of your duty to enforce the law without fear or favor. Everyone involved with this chilling surveillance campaign must face accountability.”
Read the full letter
here
or below.
April 11, 2023
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
Last month, I questioned you before the Senate Judiciary Committee about recent anti-Catholic actions by the Department of Justice. There was the targeting of Catholic pro-life activist Mark Houck with overwhelming FBI force—all based on a trumped-up charge, of which he was swiftly acquitted. And then there was the internal memorandum issued by the FBI’s Richmond field office calling for the reconnaissance and investigation of traditionalist Catholics.
Alarmed by this emerging pattern, I asked you directly whether the Department of Justice has “a problem with anti-Catholic bias.” Your response could not have been clearer: according to you, the Department of Justice “does not have any bias against any religion of any kind.”
I went on to ask you whether the Department was “cultivating sources and spies in Latin mass parishes and other Catholic parishes around the country.” And again, your response could not have been clearer: “No, the Justice Department does not do that. It does not do investigations based on religion.”
Finally, I asked you “how many informants do you have in Catholic churches across America?” You denied the claim a third time: “I don’t know, and I don’t believe we have any informants aimed at Catholic churches.”
All of this was false, as recent investigative findings by the House Judiciary Committee show. Following the revelation of the FBI’s Richmond memorandum, the Committee sought further information. And despite the FBI’s stonewalling, the Committee finally succeeded in extracting a heavily redacted document revealing damning facts.
What were those facts? First, the FBI’s infiltration proposal was apparently based on information from an undercover employee. The FBI does in fact have “informants aimed at Catholic churches,” contrary to your testimony. And second, the FBI apparently contemplated “engag[ing] in outreach to the leadership” of Catholic traditionalist parishes, for the purpose of “sensitiz[ing] these congregations to the warning signs of radicalization and [enlisting] their assistance to serve as suspicious activity tripwires.” This shows that the Department is clearly “cultivating sources and spies” in Catholic parishes, regardless of what you claimed before the Senate Judiciary Committee. And at this point, it is altogether unclear how many other FBI field offices received these directives. The potential scale of this anti-Catholic program is extremely concerning.
Let’s be clear: your Department has decided to turn Catholic congregations into front organizations for the FBI, and when asked about it, you’ve decided to fudge the truth before Congress. This is an unconscionable assault on American Catholics’ First Amendment rights and an abdication of your duty to enforce the law without fear or favor.
Everyone involved with this chilling surveillance campaign must face accountability. To that end, please immediately provide my office with responses to the following questions:
How many undercover informants or other agents in Catholic parishes or other organizations does the Department work with or otherwise employ
How many undercover informants or other agents, in religious organizations more broadly, does the Department work with or otherwise employ?
Within which, and how many, FBI field offices was guidance related to the infiltration of traditionalist Catholic parishes distributed?
In addition, you must immediately comply with all oversight requests from the House Judiciary Committee.
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Pushes Biden Administration to Explain their ‘Concierge Service for Illegals’
Date: Thursday, March 30, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding answers on the Department’s new CBP One app.
“Under your leadership, the Department is marketing a new phone app, called CBP One, that allows unauthorized migrants to reserve a time to cross the border, like making a restaurant reservation. How convenient,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“I imagine there are plenty of Americans who would appreciate this level of service from their government. Your choice to spend untold sums of taxpayer money—you said you had no idea what it cost—on concierge service for illegals is baffling. It is also revealing. It demonstrates your priorities: open borders, no matter the cost to Americans; no matter the jobs lost, the wages lost, the drugs flooding our schools.”
Senator Hawley posed several questions for Secretary Mayorkas about the app, including whether it is a national security risk and how many individuals are projected to use it in the weeks ahead.
Earlier this week, Senator Hawley
questioned
Secretary Mayorkas on the CBP One app
in a Senate Judiciary hearing.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
March 30, 2023
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
Stopping illegal immigration is your responsibility. But it does not appear to be your priority. Instead, as you and I discussed in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, you are busy providing concierge service to illegal migrants.
Under your leadership, the Department is marketing a new phone app, called CBP One, that allows unauthorized migrants to reserve a time to cross the border, like making a restaurant reservation. How convenient. I gather the app is meant to expedite asylum claims, or so your Department’s promotional material says. But I noticed you said nothing about asylum when I asked you at the hearing. And the Texas Monthly has recently reported that “[a]t no point does the app ask users ‘Are you seeking asylum?’” Worse, when migrants show up at the border to enter the country, they “are given no interviews and asked no questions about vulnerabilities they listed in the app or about why they’re seeking asylum in the U.S.—they’re simply released into the country on official parole.”
You told me at the hearing that the app was available to a limited number of persons. But you also said “tens of thousands” of migrants have used it. And your Department has pledged to “expan[d] access to the app in Central Mexico”—so even more migrants can schedule their border crossing.
That is far from limited.
I imagine there are plenty of Americans who would appreciate this level of service from their government. Your choice to spend untold sums of taxpayer money—you said you had no idea what it cost—on concierge service for illegals is baffling. It is also revealing. It demonstrates your priorities: open borders, no matter the cost to Americans; no matter the jobs lost, the wages lost, the drugs flooding our schools.
And then there are the national security risks, which your new app makes far worse. Migrants who use CBP One to get across the border are unlikely to face consequences for years: frivolously claiming asylum ensures that an illegal migrant can stay in the United States almost indefinitely, while their asylum claim remains caught up in a massive backlog. And even if they ultimately lose their asylum cases, DHS won’t deport them anyway.
The CBP One app, in its current form, is a full-on institutionalization of an open border and the abuse of our asylum laws. So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information—which I asked you about in this week’s hearing—by April 10, 2023:
How many individuals have claimed “vulnerable” status through the CBP One app since its rollout?
How many individuals are projected to use the CBP One app following the cessation of Title 42 authority in the weeks ahead?
Will the CBP One app be updated to ask users whether they are in fact asylum seekers?
Are there national security risks posed by migrants potentially abusing the CBP One app?
How much did the CBP One app cost to develop?
Which, if any, third-party companies or other contractors were involved in the development of the CBP One app, and how much were they paid for their services?
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Army Provide Update on Plan to Replace Housing at Fort Leonard Wood
Date: Thursday, March 30, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth requesting, for the third time, the Army’s plan for replacing the aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
“I write again to request the Army’s plan for replacing aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. You committed to share this information in May 2022 and again in October 2022, but the Army still has not sent it,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“This lack of responsiveness suggests the Army may not actually have a plan for meeting Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements in contradiction of your previous assurances. The Army has made some progress—but only under duress and far more remains to be done.”
He continued,
“Service members and their families at Fort Leonard Wood deserve better than empty promises. […] Ensuring quality housing at Fort Leonard Wood is and will remain a top priority for me.”
BACKGROUND
In December 2022, Senator Hawley
announced
that the Army committed to spending $41.4 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and another $50 million in Fiscal Year 2024 for new housing at Fort Leonard Wood following repeated demands that aging homes at the base be replaced.
In August 2022, Senator Hawley
toured
Fort Leonard Wood, delivered remarks about the important work being done there, and visited with residents about base housing in need of replacement.
A few weeks before his August visit, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary Wormuth requesting an update on the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
In May 2022, Senator Hawley
pressed
Secretary Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
In June of 2021, Senator Hawley
asked
Secretary Wormuth and General McConville for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing at the base.
Read the full letter
here
or below:
Honorable Christine Wormuth
Secretary of the Army
101 Army Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20310-0101
Dear Secretary Wormuth,
I write again to request the Army’s plan for replacing aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. You committed to share this information in May 2022 and again in October 2022, but the Army still has not sent it. This lack of responsiveness suggests the Army may not actually have a plan for meeting Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements in contradiction of your previous assurances.
The Army has made some progress—but only under duress and far more remains to be done. I acknowledge, for instance, the Army’s commitment last year to invest $41.4 million in Fort Leonard Wood housing. Under Secretary of the Army Gabe Camarillo confirmed these funds will be invested in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023; I intend to see that they are. I also recognize the Army’s request for $50 million for Fort Leonard Wood housing in the FY 2024 budget request. These are steps in the right direction, but they have as often as not come after I have resorted to holding Army nominees. Moreover—and more importantly—while these investments are essential, far more is required to fulfill Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements.
None of this is news. You and I first discussed this matter at a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) hearing on June 15, 2021. Shortly after the hearing, Army Materiel Command (AMC) and Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) informed my office that “Balfour Beatty Corporation is working a private investment initiative that will make as much as $340M available to improve BBC housing across the Army portfolio beginning later [in 2021].” But that never happened. Instead, on May 3, 2022, the Army notified my office that the funds identified in the AMC/IMCOM letter were no longer available.
I raised this troubling development with you at a SASC hearing on May 5, 2022. During this conversation, you committed to share exactly how and when the Army planned to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. Three months later, your office still had not provided this information, so on August 5, 2022, I sent you a letter requesting it again. It took another three months before I received a reply from Under Secretary Camarillo, but that reply again failed to explain how the Army plans to replace all of the aging homes in question.
You and I spoke further about housing at Fort Leonard Wood on October 12, 2022. During this conversation, you told me the Army had “mapped out in detail” its plan for meeting Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements, and you committed once more to share that information. That commitment, too, remains unfulfilled.
Service members and their families at Fort Leonard Wood deserve better than empty promises. This in mind, I request answers to the following no later than April 29, 2023:
How does the Army plan to fund the replacement of all of the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?
What is the Army’s timeline for replacing all of the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?
As part of your responses to these questions, I ask that you share copies of the plans you referenced in our conversations in May and October 2022.
Ensuring quality housing at Fort Leonard Wood is and will remain a top priority for me. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley and Warren Lead Bipartisan Legislation to Claw Back Compensation From Executives Responsible for Bank Failures
Date: Wednesday, March 29, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), introduced the
Failed Bank Executives Clawback Act,
bipartisan legislation that would require that, in the event of a bank failures like Silicon Valley Bank, federal regulators claw back all or part of the compensation received by bank executives in the five-year period preceding the failure.
Currently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) ability to claw back executive compensation in the event of a bank failure is limited. The
Failed Bank Executives Clawback Act
would give federal bank regulators the tools they need to hold executives of failed banks responsible for the costs those failures exact on the rest of the banking system and the economy, and require the FDIC to act to prevent the unjust enrichment of bank executives.
“Bank executives who make risky investments with customers’ money shouldn’t be permitted to profit in the good times, and then avoid financial consequences when things go south,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This legislation puts the executives’ own profits on the line, and that’s exactly as it should be.”
“The President called on Congress to pass a new law to hold failed bank CEOs accountable and give the financial cops on the beat additional authority to clawback lavish pay and bonuses when executives explode their bank – and this bipartisan bill answers that imperative,”
said Senator Warren.
“Americans are sick and tired of fat cat bankers paying themselves handsomely while risking other people’s hard earned money. It’s time for Congress to step up and strengthen the law so bank executives bear the cost of failure, not line their pockets and walk away scot-free.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley and Senator Braun
introduced
the
Protecting Consumers from Bailouts Act,
which would prevent the FDIC from levying “special assessments” on community banks to pay for bailing out the uninsured depositors of failing banks, protecting customers from new fees and forcing the big banks to face up to their mistakes.
Specifically, the
Failed Bank Executives Clawback Act
would:
Require the FDIC to claw back from bank executives all or part of the compensation they have received over the five-year period preceding a bank’s insolvency or FDIC-resolution as is necessary to prevent unjust enrichment.
Extend claw back authorities established by Section 204(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to apply to any bank entered into FDIC receivership, not only those resolved under the FDIC’s Orderly Liquidation Authority.
Ensure that, should an insured depository institution affiliated with a bank holding company fail, investors in that holding company should bear the losses of the insured depository institution.

Title: Hawley Request to Unanimously Pass Bill to Ban TikTok Blocked on Senate Floor
Date: Wednesday, March 29, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor and called for unanimous consent on his legislation to ban TikTok in the United States, due to its serious threat to national security, rampant data collection on American users, and the application’s close connection to the Chinese Communist Party.
“We should act decisively to ban TikTok directly. We shouldn’t give new open-ended authority to federal bureaucrats, we should target this threat specifically. That’s what this bill does that we have before us today and it goes right at the problem. It bans TikTok in this country, it protects the American people, and it sends the message to Communist China that you cannot buy us,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley’s call to unanimously pass the bill, and his call to schedule a vote on the bill, were both objected to by Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
In January, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
to prohibit TikTok from operating in the United States and ban commercial activity with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.
The
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
would:
Direct the President to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) within 30 days to block and prohibit transactions with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, with stiff penalties for entities that attempt to evade these sanctions.
Within 120 days of enactment, require the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report and brief Congress on the threats to national security posed by TikTok, including:
The ability of Chinese government to access U.S. user data.
The ability of the Chinese government to use U.S. user data for intelligence or military purposes, including surveillance, microtargeting, deepfakes, or blackmail.
Ongoing efforts by the Chinese government to monitor or manipulate Americans using data accessed via TikTok.
Last year, Senator Hawley’s
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
prohibiting TikTok on federal government devices was
signed into law. It went into effect at the beginning of March.

Title: Hawley Demands FBI and DHS Investigate Deadly Attack on Christian School as Hate Crime
Date: Tuesday, March 28, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for an investigation into the deadly massacre that occurred at The Covenant School yesterday as a federal hate crime.
“Yesterday the nation witnessed the vicious murder of small schoolchildren in Nashville, Tennessee. […] It is commonplace to call such horrors ‘senseless violence.’ But properly speaking, that is false. Police report that the attack here was “targeted”—targeted, that is, against Christians,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “The full resources of the federal government must be brought to bear to determine how this crime occurred, and who may have influenced the deranged shooter to carry out these horrific crimes. Hate that leads to violence must be condemned. And hate crimes must be prosecuted.”

The Honorable Christopher A. Wray             The Honorable Alejandro N.Mayorkas
Director                                                          Secretary
Federal Bureau of Investigation                    U.S. Department of Homeland Security
935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW                     301 7th St, SW
Washington, D.C. 20535                               Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Director Wray and Secretary Mayorkas:
Yesterday the nation witnessed the vicious murder of small schoolchildren in Nashville, Tennessee. An individual identified by police as Audrey Hale killed six people—students Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, and employees Cynthia Peak, Katherine Koonce, and Michael Hill—in a murderous rampage at a Christian school known as The Covenant School. It is commonplace to call such horrors “senseless violence.” But properly speaking, that is false. Police report that the attack here was “targeted”—targeted, that is, against Christians.
Federal law explicitly criminalizes acts of violence against individuals based on religious affiliation as hate crimes. To be exact, the federal hate crime statute, 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(1), bars “willfully caus[ing] bodily injury to any person . . . because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person.” According to Nashville law enforcement, Hale’s attack was both premeditated and “targeted” against this Christian school, its students and employees. Nashville police chief John Drake announced yesterday that “we have a manifesto, we have some writings that we’re going over that pertain to this date, the actual incident . . . . We have a map drawn out of how this was all going to take place.” Moreover, police detectives believe that Hale had “some resentment for having to go to that school.”
I urge you to immediately open an investigation into this shooting as a federal hate crime. The full resources of the federal government must be brought to bear to determine how this crime occurred, and who may have influenced the deranged shooter to carry out these horrific crimes. Hate that leads to violence must be condemned. And hate crimes must be prosecuted.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Following the senseless and
targeted
attack on Christian children and adults at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tenn., U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
a
resolution
condemning the deadly shooting as a federal hate crime.
“This murderous rampage, this taking of innocent life, was a horrific crime. But more specifically, it was a hate crime,”
said Senator Hawley. “It is a crime under federal law to target and commit acts of violence against Americans because of their religious beliefs, because of their religious affiliation, or because of their religious practices. This should not happen in the United States of America, and now we must act to see that it does not spread.”
Senator Hawley also
delivered remarks
on the U.S. Senate floor today, urging Congress to pass his
resolution
condemning the violence against The Covenant School.
Earlier today, Senator Hawley

to FBI Director Christopher Wray and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling for an investigation into the deadly shooting.
The text of the resolution can be found

RESOLUTION
Whereas, on March 27, 2023, a deranged individual tragically and violently opened fire at The Covenant School, a religious institution in Nashville, Tennessee, that is part of the Covenant Presbyterian Church;
Whereas this heinous act resulted in the death of 3 innocent students, namely Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney;
Whereas 3 dedicated school employees, Cynthia Peak, Katherine Koonce, and Michael Hill, also tragically lost their lives in the line of duty;
Whereas Federal law explicitly prohibits violence against people of the United States on the basis of religious affiliation or belief;

Title: Hawley Grills Mayorkas on ‘CBP One’ App, Calling it a ‘Ticketmaster’ for Illegal Immigration
Date: Tuesday, March 28, 2023

Content:
Today in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, slamming him over his failed handling of the crisis at the southern border and his rollout of the agency’s “CBP One” app for illegal migrants.
Senator Hawley called the Biden administration’s use of the app, saying it incentivizes more illegal immigration,
muddles
the immigration process, and acts as a concierge service for immigrants to make appointments to come across the border and likely stay in the country illegally.
“So rather than building a wall, Mr. Secretary, you have built Ticketmaster for illegal immigrants,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Just respond to this—Is it true that they are given no interviews, asked no questions, and simply released into the country?”
Senator Hawley went on to reiterate Mayorkas’s failure to secure the southern border, and once again called for his resignation.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed on Upcoming Ukraine Vote
Date: Monday, March 27, 2023

Content:
‘Where’s all the Ukraine money going? This person can help find the truth’
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley | March 27, 2023 |
Fox News
Over the last year, our leaders have sent a mind-blowing amount of money to Ukraine. If Congress cares about making sure that cash is well spent, they should go on record about it.
This week, the Senate will vote on my amendment to set up an inspector general to track every single taxpayer dollar going to Ukraine. Who could oppose that?
[…]
A huge portion of U.S. assistance is provided directly to the Ukrainian government – straight cash, spent by foreign government bureaucrats. Meanwhile, just a few months ago, Ukraine dropped out of consideration for the 2030 World Cup after its sports officials were caught embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Too corrupt for FIFA – the famously shady soccer authority – is saying a lot.
American taxpayers deserve better than this. Earlier this month, I introduced legislation that would create a designated government watchdog – a special inspector general for Ukraine – to track every dollar that American taxpayers have sent to Ukraine. Now the Senate will vote on it.
Right now, no single authority is responsible for overseeing our Ukraine spending. The responsibility is supposedly split between three agencies – the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. But when the buck stops with no one, there’s no ultimate accountability for policing waste, fraud and abuse.
So let’s change that. Let’s put a single Senate-confirmed person in charge, and give them power to conduct the necessary audits, investigations and oversight. And let’s insist on regular reporting to keep track of the flow of funds, the military equipment being acquired, and Ukrainian anticorruption efforts. That’s the kind of toolkit we need.
[…]
It’s far from clear that the conflict in Ukraine is winding down – indeed, some in Congress are already calling for more “emergency” aid. The very least we can do is pass legislation that helps us ensure that our money is serving the purposes stated in law. If the Biden administration doesn’t care enough to keep tabs on American funds, then it’s up to Congress to insist on it.

Title: Hawley Demands Justice for Jana Elementary Families, Urges Senate to Pass Bill to Clean Up School
Date: Wednesday, March 22, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks and attempted to unanimously pass his legislation to clean up Jana Elementary School and test the surrounding buildings in the Hazelwood School District, but it was blocked.
“Imagine being a parent and waking up to this headline: ‘Missouri elementary school to close after report finds radioactive contamination.’ […] The school board had no choice, they found radioactive material in their kids’ building so they shut down the school,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “We can send the message that no matter who you are, no matter where you work, no matter how poor you may be, the United States Senate will get something done for you. We ought to send that message today.”
Senator Hawley has strongly advocated on behalf of the students and families of the Hazelwood School District for months. Most recently, Senator Hawley
called out
the Biden Administration for its lack of action on the Jana Elementary School cleanup, and pledged to hold all nominees to positions at the Department of Energy until the issue is resolved.
In February, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
Justice for Jana Elementary Act
following an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing where he pushed the Department of Energy for answers on the radioactive waste found near the school.
In January, Senator Hawley and Representative Bush
sent a letter
to USACE Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon calling for additional radioactive testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties.
Last October, Senator Hawley
demanded
that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School following reports of contamination, and
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for students and families.

Title: Hawley Announces First Bill in Worker’s Agenda to Rebuild America: Ending Normal Trade Relations with China Act
Date: Monday, March 20, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the first piece of legislation in his new Worker’s Agenda to Rebuild America. The
Ending Normal Trade Relations with China Act
would revoke China’s normal trade relations status to reduce our dependency and protect America’s working class.
China is America’s greatest adversary. To win the fierce economic competition for jobs, industry, and the future, America must return to the long-standing formula for American success: strong and independent workers. Years of short-sighted decisions by policymakers in Washington have only perpetuated the problem.
“As we face a new age of competition with China, we need an agenda in Washington that will make our working class strong and independent. We can start by revoking the sweetheart deal D.C. elites handed to China 23 years ago—end normal trade relations, put in place strong tariffs, and protect American workers,”
said Senator Hawley.
In 2000, the United States granted China normal trade relations status, permanently. The United States then supported China’s ascension to the World Trade Organization just one year later. Providing China privileged trade status contributed to
the loss of 3.7 million good jobs
across manufacturing industries in America. When these jobs and factories disappeared, communities suffered. The
unwinding of the social fabric
in these forgotten places led to declining rates of marriage and fertility, and rising rates of addiction, divorce, and suicide. Policies that weaken working men and women in America and enrich the Chinese Communist Party must be repealed.
The
Ending Normal Trade Relations with China Act
would:
Revoke China’s normal trade relations status.
Subject imports from China to higher tariff rates.
Provide the President with the authority to increase these tariffs even higher.

said Senator Hawley. “The American deserve to know the truth behind the origins of the pandemic and we must begin the process of holding China accountable.”
Senator Hawley’s
COVID Origins Act of 2023
passed the Senate
unanimously for the second time
early this month and subsequently passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 419-0. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) previously introduced the COVID Origins Act of 2021 in May 2021, which passed the Senate
unanimously.
In March 2020, Senator Hawley was the first member of Congress to call for an

introduced legislation
to allow American citizens to sue the Chinese government for damages.

Title: New Hawley Bill Allows Private Citizens to Sue Big Tech Platforms for Hosting CSAM
Date: Wednesday, March 15, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Everyone can Notice-and-Takedown Distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material (END CSAM) Act, new legislation allowing private citizens to sue Big Tech platforms for hosting CSAM.
“The exploitation of children online must be stopped,” said
Senator Hawley. “Social media companies have proven to be hubs for child sexual abuse material, and they need be held accountable for their failures. My legislation empowers the American people to bring suit against these Big Tech companies, protecting our children online and cleaning up the internet in the process.”
The END CSAM Act
would
:
Create a legal framework through which private plaintiffs can sue, on behalf of the government, companies that host child exploitation content.
Plaintiffs will be empowered to bring civil lawsuits against companies that display CSAM on their websites. The government will have an option to intervene in the action and prosecute it independently, or may allow the private plaintiff to do so. In either case, the private plaintiff will be able to recover money damages.
Drastically curtail the spread of child exploitation material online.
Under threat of third-party litigation, Big Tech companies would have a powerful incentive to use all the tools available to them to take down child exploitation content before it spreads, or screen user-uploaded content for it before it appears on the platform in the first place.

Title: Hawley and Braun Introduce New Legislation to Protect Consumers and Community Banks from Big Bank Failures
Date: Wednesday, March 15, 2023

Content:
Following
recent news
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) bailout of two failed banks, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced the
Protecting Consumers from Bailouts Act
to protect consumers from new fees and to force the big banks to face up to their mistakes. The Biden administration
announced
that they will impose “special assessment” fees on banks across the country to pay for the Silicon Valley Bank bailout.
“Consumers and community banks should not have to shoulder the cost of fiscal irresponsibility by big financial institutions,”
said Senator Hawley. “The Biden administration wants to take money from the American taxpayer and local banks through new fees so they can use it to bail out California billionaires. We must protect hardworking Americans and force the big banks to pay for their own mistakes.”
“Community banks and their customers in Indiana should not be on the hook for bailing out Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank for their risky financial decisions. We need to make sure responsible community banks and regular Americans are not footing the bill for President Biden’s bank bailout,”
said Senator Braun.
The
Protecting Consumers from Bailouts Act
would:
Bar banks from passing to their customers the cost of any “special assessment” by the FDIC to bail out Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank
Prevent the FDIC from levying “special assessments” on community banks to pay for bailing out the uninsured depositors of failing banks
Allow the FDIC to claw back bonuses paid to executives of failed banks

Title: TIKTOK WHISTLEBLOWER: Hawley Demands Thorough Review of Explosive New Allegations
Date: Wednesday, March 08, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, in her capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), demanding a thorough review of the whistleblower allegations recently brought to Senator Hawley.
“I write regarding new information brought to my attention by a former ByteDance employee with direct knowledge of TikTok’s operating practices,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“As Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), you are responsible for reviewing certain foreign transactions in the United States to determine potential threats to national security. This whistleblower’s allegations are deeply concerning. They also appear to contradict public statements made by TikTok and ByteDance executives.”
He continued,
“These highly disturbing allegations are yet another reason why we should ban TikTok in the United States. Despite TikTok’s many reassurances that members of the Chinese Communist Party do not have access to U.S. data, it seems more and more likely that they do.”
Allegations include:
TikTok and ByteDance employees – including members of the Chinese Communist Party known to be on ByteDance’s payroll – can switch between Chinese and U.S. data with nothing more than the click of a button.
TikTok and ByteDance employees use tools that allow for easy access to U.S. data. Some tools only require approval from a manager and a dataset owner before a China-based employee can access U.S. data.
TikTok coordinates activities with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. They use the same data analysis tools and chat apps, and managers are in constant contact.
In his letter, Senator Hawley pressed Secretary Yellen on whether or not CFIUS is already looking into the processes alleged by the whistleblower.
In January, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
to prohibit TikTok from being downloaded on U.S. devices and ban commercial activity with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.
Last year, Senator Hawley’s
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
prohibiting TikTok on federal government devices was
signed into law. It went into effect last week.
Read his new letter
here
or below.
March 8, 2023
The Honorable Janet Yellen
Secretary
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Secretary Yellen,
I write regarding new information brought to my attention by a former ByteDance employee with direct knowledge of TikTok’s operating practices. As Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), you are responsible for reviewing certain foreign transactions in the United States to determine potential threats to national security. This whistleblower’s allegations are deeply concerning. They also appear to contradict public statements made by TikTok and ByteDance executives.
On September 14, 2022, TikTok’s Chief Operating Officer, Vanessa Pappas, testified to Congress that “[w]e have strict controls in terms of who and how our data is accessed.” She went on to say, “[w]e believe we have the strictest controls out there.” Furthermore, “[a]nyone who has access to U.S. user data has” this in order “to perform daily duties,” such as “site management [or] bug handling.” But, she testified, “there are strict access controls around the data that is accessed in the United States.” That is because, “[f]or our U.S. users, the data is sorted and housed in the United States.”
Recent events cast substantial doubt on just how robust TikTok’s access controls really are. On October 20, 2022, for instance, Forbes reported that a China-based ByteDance team planned to use the TikTok app to monitor American citizens’ personal locations. Reuters similarly reported on December 22, 2022, that TikTok employees accessed user data from two American journalists.
Now, a TikTok whistleblower has come forward with allegations that shed new light on these troubling reports. The whistleblower describes TikTok’s access controls on U.S. data as “superficial” at best, where they exist at all. As an example, he describes how TikTok and ByteDance employees – including members of the Chinese Communist Party known to be on ByteDance’s payroll – can switch between Chinese and U.S. data with nothing more than the click of a button using a proprietary tool called Dorado. In his words, “[i]t’s just like a light switch.”
Other tools used by TikTok and ByteDance employees allegedly allow for similarly easy access to U.S. data. According to the whistleblower, some tools, such as Aeolus, only require approval from a manager and a dataset owner before an employee can access U.S. data. Most concerningly, the whistleblower reports: “I have seen first-hand China-based engineers flipping over to non-China datasets and creating scheduled tasks to backup, aggregate, and analyze data.”
Finally, the whistleblower describes in detail how TikTok coordinates activities with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. As he puts it, “TikTok and ByteDance are functionally the same company. They use the same data analysis tools and chat apps, and managers are in constant contact.” The whistleblower also points out that, unlike other social media companies, TikTok and ByteDance rely on proprietary software they engineered in China, thereby reducing foreign scrutiny and enabling Chinese engineers to insert software backdoors.
These highly disturbing allegations are yet another reason why we should ban TikTok in the United States. Despite TikTok’s many reassurances that members of the Chinese Communist Party do not have access to U.S. data, it seems more and more likely that they do. These explosive whistleblower allegations deserve a thorough review and should support a final determination by CFIUS that blocks TikTok’s continued operation in the United States.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by March 20, 2023:
Has TikTok or ByteDance disclosed to CFIUS any software tools, datasets facilities, or internal products named Dorado, Big Service Management, Coral, Triton, or Aeolus?
Has TikTok or ByteDance disclosed to CFIUS whether employees in China have the ability to toggle between U.S. and Chinese data through any of the tools listed above? If so, please explain the access controls on these systems.
Has TikTok disclosed to CFIUS whether U.S. data can be accessed on systems like Dorado by engineers based in China?
Has CFIUS obtained any details relating to the internal approval process for accessing U.S. data by TikTok or ByteDance employees? Please list all access controls protecting U.S. data.
Is it your understanding that China-based companies and their employees are subject to Article 7 of China’s National Intelligence Law, which provides “Any organization or citizen shall support, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law”?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Bill Bans Chinese Corporations from Owning U.S. Farmland, Protects American Farmers
Date: Tuesday, March 07, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley introduced the
This Land is Our Land Act, new legislation to ban Chinese corporations and individuals associated with the Chinese Communist Party from owning United States agricultural land.
“No Chinese corporation or individual associated with the CCP should be permitted to own American farmland. It undermines the integrity of our nation’s food supply chain, it presents national security threats when the land is in close proximity to military installations, and it hurts American farmers,”
said Senator Hawley
China’s ownership of U.S. agricultural land has
increased
dramatically over the past decade. At the end of 2020, Chinese entities held more than 338,000 acres of land, a 350% increase from the 75,000 acres they held at the end of 2010.
Senator Hawley’s
This Land is Our Land Act
will:
Prohibit Chinese corporations and individuals affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party from acquiring or leasing United States agricultural land.
Require Chinese corporations and individuals affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party to divest ownership of United States agricultural land within two years.
Establish civil fines and criminal penalties for noncompliance, including forfeiture.

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill Banning Senior Executive Branch Officials from Stock Trading
Date: Tuesday, March 07, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has
introduced
the
Eliminating Executive Branch Insider Trading Act, which would ban the trading and holding of individual stocks by senior Executive Branch officials, many of whom have decision-making power that impacts the work being done in their respective agencies.
The
Wall Street Journal
recently
reported
that nearly one-third of the Energy Department’s senior officials or their families owned stocks related to the agency’s work, despite being warned they could be in violation of federal conflict-of-interest rules.
“Senior members of the Executive Branch – who have access to privileged information – shouldn’t be using it to get rich,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The American people have entrusted these civil servants with implementing and enforcing laws. To ensure they abide by these standards, senior Executive Branch officials and their spouses must be banned from trading stocks.”
Earlier this year, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
PELOSI Act, prohibiting members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks.
The
Eliminating Executive Branch Insider Trading Act
would:
Prohibit senior executive branch officials and their spouses from holding, acquiring, selling, or shorting individual stocks during their tenure in office. The ban would cover the President, Vice President, and high-level civilian and military officials. The prohibition would not apply to holdings in diversified mutual funds, diversified exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bills and bonds.
Require covered officials and their spouses to divest prohibited holdings or place the assets in a blind trust within six months of assuming office. Non-compliance will result in disgorgement of any profits and stiff penalties.
Within two years of enactment and annually thereafter, require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an audit for compliance with the ban and report on its findings to the House and Senate Ethics Committees.

to United States Postal Service (USPS) Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb Hull urging that the mail delays in the Kansas City area be resolved and an investigation be conducted to prevent future delays.
“After months of widespread delays, it is well past time for the Postal Service to determine the root cause of the delays and recommend corrective action. We cannot wait any longer. Without an audit of these areas of concern, residents of the Northland will not get the services they deserve from USPS,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
In September 2022, Senator Hawley

The Honorable Tammy Whitcomb Hull
Inspector General
United States Postal Service
1735 N. Lynn Street
Arlington, Virginia, 22209-2020
Dear Inspector General Hull,
I write again with great concern regarding persistent mail delivery issues in the Kansas City Northland area. On September 28, 2022, I sent a letter requesting that your office conduct an audit of all post offices in Clay and Platte Counties in Missouri. My office has received minimal correspondence regarding this issue, and there has been no indication your office plans to complete an audit.
Mail service delays in the Northland area were first reported last September. In this report, residents shared that they routinely waited more than five days between receiving mail. Recent reporting explains that residents are still experiencing significant delays, and they are even turning to other mail services to ensure timely delivery of important documents. My office has worked with the Postal Service directly to address individual complaints.
An audit of these post offices remains necessary to solve the mail service issues. After months of widespread delays, it is well past time for the Postal Service to determine the root cause of the delays and recommend corrective action. We cannot wait any longer. Without an audit of these areas of concern, residents of the Northland will not get the services they deserve from USPS.
Please reply to my office by March 15, 2023 to detail your plans to complete this audit of the region’s post offices and your expected timeline for completing this audit.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Marshall Demand Full Accounting of All Federal Money Sent to St. Louis Trans Clinic
Date: Friday, March 03, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra demanding a full accounting of every federal dollar that has been provided to The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital (“the Center”) since its inception.
“Recently, a whistleblower who was formerly employed at the Center alleged in a sworn affidavit that the Center may have committed multiple violations of federal law, including by fraudulently billing federally-funded insurance programs,”
the Senators wrote. “As Members of U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we have a responsibility to investigate her claims that federal taxpayers may have financed the Center’s activities improperly. Doing so requires a full accounting of every federal dollar that has been provided to the Center since its inception.”
As part of his
ongoing investigation, Senator Hawley previously
sent a letter
to Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Dr. Andrew Martin and BJC HealthCare President and CEO Richard Liekweg, requesting information about the receipt and use of federal funds in connection with the Center. Yesterday, Chancellor Martin
confirmed
to Senator Hawley that Washington University would comply with the request within four weeks.
Last month, Senator Hawley
introduced legislation
that would allow those who were harmed by gender-transition procedures as minors to bring lawsuits against the participating individuals and entities. The
Protecting Our Kids from Child Abuse Act
would prohibit federal funding from any pediatric gender clinic, any university or hospital that is affiliated with a pediatric gender clinic, and any gender-transition procedure performed on minors.
Upon
announcing his investigation
in early February, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the university chancellor, hospital president, and the center’s co-directors demanding the institutions immediately take steps to preserve all records, written and electronic, regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors since the opening of the Center.
Last month, Senator Hawley opened a
whistleblower tipline
for those with direct information about potential malpractice and abuses happening at pediatric transgender centers.

March 3, 2023
The Honorable Xavier Becerra
Secretary
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
200 Independence Avenue SW
Washington, D.C. 20201
Dear Secretary Becerra:
We write to request information regarding federal payments made to The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital (“the Center”). Recently, a whistleblower who was formerly employed at the Center alleged in a sworn affidavit that the Center may have committed multiple violations of federal law, including by fraudulently billing federally-funded insurance programs. As Members of U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we have a responsibility to investigate her claims that federal taxpayers may have financed the Center’s activities improperly. Doing so requires a full accounting of every federal dollar that has been provided to the Center since its inception.
As first reported in The Free Press, the whistleblower Jamie Reed alleges an extraordinary pattern of abuse and potential malpractice committed by the Center’s staff. Among the various shocking allegations in Ms. Reed’s sworn affidavit is her claim that the Center billed the cost of gender-transition procedures to federally-funded insurance programs—a practice which apparently continues to this day. According to reporting by The Washington Post, Ms. Reed “alleged that the center billed some treatments to the federal Medicaid health care program.”
Furthermore, Ms. Reed alleges that she “personally witnessed [the Center’s] staff report that they were aware that patients had been coded incorrectly” on bills sent to publicly-funded insurance programs. In other words, she alleges that the Center committed insurance fraud.
As you may know, the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is authorized to study and investigate:
the efficiency and economy of operations of all branches of the Government including the possible existence of fraud, misfeasance, malfeasance, collusion, mismanagement, incompetence, corruption or unethical practices, waste, extravagance, conflicts of interest, and the improper expenditure of Government funds in transactions, contracts, and activities of the Government or of Government officials and employees and any and all such improper practices between Government personnel and corporations, individuals, companies, or persons affiliated therewith, doing business with the Government, and the compliance or noncompliance of such corporations, companies, or individuals or other entities with the rules, regulations, and laws governing the various governmental agencies and the Governments relationship with the public.
Accordingly, please provide the following information by no later than March 16, 2023:
All copies of bills, grant requests, or any other documents submitted or sent by the Center to the Department of Health and Human Services or any subagency thereof.
All receipts of federal disbursements made to the Center by or under any program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or any subagency thereof.
All records concerning or relating in any manner to the Center’s application for funding under any program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or any subagency thereof.
All communication, including emails, between the Center’s employees and the Department of Health and Human Services or any subagency thereof.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) introduced the
Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance Act
to establish a Special Inspector General to oversee the military and non-military assistance to Ukraine. The United States has
appropriated
$113 billion in aid to Ukraine – more than the contributions made by all European NATO allies combined.
“The United States has been sending endless money to Ukraine despite a lack of oversight and without putting any pressure on our European allies to do the same. It is far past time U.S. lawmakers stop writing blank-checks to Ukraine and demand a strict accounting of where these tax dollars are actually going,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance Act
would:
Establish a Special Inspector General for Ukraine Assistance (SIGUA) office charged with overseeing all military and non-military U.S. assistance appropriated or otherwise made available for Ukraine.
Direct the new office to submit quarterly reports to Congress on obligations and expenditure of U.S funds and the provision of military equipment.
Reports will also track the Ukrainian government’s compliance with anti-corruption measures, and comparisons of America’s contribution to the war effort versus those from our NATO allies.
Require the President’s nominee to serve as SIGUA to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

February 28, 2023
The Hon. Jennifer Granholm
Secretary
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Ave., SW
Washington, DC 20585
Dear Secretary Granholm,
Recent reporting indicates that the Department of Energy (DOE) has concluded that the COVID-19 virus was the result of a lab leak. According to the Wall Street Journal, experts in your Department have recently memorialized this conclusion in a classified report.
If true, this conclusion would have far-reaching consequences. It would impact how we treat COVID-19 patients, how we investigate the role that federal agencies may have played in funding these labs, and how we hold China accountable for its role in potentially creating and covering up the novel COVID-19. This information needs to be declassified and immediately made available to the public.
The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world since its initial emergence in 2019 near Wuhan, China—home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other laboratories. Left-wing activists, infectious disease czar Anthony Fauci, and the Chinese government were all quick to condemn anyone who raised questions about the origins of the virus. The Washington Post and other outlets labeled this a “fringe theory.” Many on social media platforms were censored, demonetized, or banned. Yet apparently, now both the FBI and DOE have embraced the lab leak theory.
DOE’s about-face comes at a critical time. The scientific journal Nature recently reported that the World Health Organization abandoned the second phase of its investigation into the origins of COVID-19 because the Chinese government failed to cooperate. If the United States government has new reason to believe that COVID-19 was the result of a lab leak, we must immediately pressure China to be transparent about its role in the origins of the pandemic—and hold China accountable. After everything Americans have gone through, they are entitled to answers about how COVID-19 emerged and what the United States government knows about it. I urge you to immediately declassify this report, all supporting documentation, and all records relating to the origins of COVID-19. The American people deserve the truth.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by March 10, 2023:
A complete, unredacted version of DOE’s report concluding that COVID-19 likely originated in a laboratory. Please also note who, if anyone, within the department authorized the contents of this classified report to be shared with the media.
All agency records and communications, including with outside parties, regarding this changed assessment.
All records and communications raising concerns with biosecurity measures in Chinese laboratory facilities, within the past 10 years.
Has DOE provided any funding to Chinese or American entities for research in China? If so, what steps have been taken to ensure that the research is being conducted in a safe and secure manner?
Does DOE continue to collaborate with Chinese researchers? If so, does the DOE have any concerns about leaks assisted by American research? If not, when did the DOE terminate these collaborations?
If necessary to answer any of these questions, please work with my staff to schedule a briefing in a SCIF as soon as possible.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Risch Introduce Bill to Secure Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers Amid Uptick in Violence
Date: Wednesday, March 01, 2023

Content:
This week U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined a bill led by Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) – the
Pregnancy Center Security Act
– to enhance security for pro-life pregnancy centers and to protect staff and patients from violence and extremism. The legislation will establish a grant program for pregnancy-help organizations to implement security upgrades, including the installation of security cameras and systems.
Following the Supreme Court’s decision in
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the U.S. has seen a
dangerous uptick
in violence against pro-life pregnancy centers, organizations, and churches. In Pocatello, Idaho,
Compassion & Hope Pregnancy Center
was vandalized.
“Since the illegal leak of the Dobbs decision last year, radical pro-abortion extremists have ramped up violent attacks on pro-life pregnancy care centers in an attempt to intimidate pro-life workers, volunteers, and the vulnerable women they serve – and the Biden Administration has turned a blind eye,”
said Senator Hawley.
“It is imperative that we invest in enhanced security for these centers, so they may operate without the constant threat of violence and focus squarely on the life-saving work they do on a daily basis.”
“Under the Biden administration, the fight to protect life has become increasingly dangerous. Pro-life pregnancy centers across the nation, which provide vital resources for women, the unborn, and our communities, have become targets for violent attacks. To ensure these life-saving centers can continue to safely operate, the
Pregnancy Center Security Act
would create a grant program to enable security upgrades,”
said Senator Risch.
“While the fight for life is far from over, the
Pregnancy Center Security Act
is a step in the right direction to ensure those on the frontlines protecting life are safe.”
The
Pregnancy Center Security Act
is also co-sponsored by Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The legislation has received support from Heartbeat International, Students for Life Action, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, CatholicVote, SBA Pro-Life America, and Family Research Council.
The
Pregnancy Center Security Act
would:
Establish a grant program for pregnancy-help organizations to implement security upgrades, including the installation of security cameras and systems, and update facilities for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance.
Ensure organizations that perform, assist, counsel, prescribe, refer to an abortion provider, or encourage abortion do not receive federal funds.

Title: Hawley, Vance, Brown, and Colleagues Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Improve Rail Safety
Date: Wednesday, March 01, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators JD Vance (R-Ohio), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and John Fetterman (D-Pa.) to introduce new legislation to improve the safety of the nation’s rail system following the train derailment that devastated the community in East Palestine, Ohio.
The Railway Safety Act of 2023
would improve rail safety protocols, establish new safety requirements for trains carrying hazardous materials, mitigate derailment risk with rules for train weight and size, increase fines for wrongdoing committed by rail carriers, and more.
“What happened in East Palestine was a horrific tragedy,”
said Senator Hawley. “The safety regulations governing our nation’s railroads must be updated to ensure that a disaster like this never happens again.”
“Through this legislation, Congress has a real opportunity to ensure that what happened in East Palestine will never happen again. We owe every American the peace of mind that their community is protected from a catastrophe of this kind,”
said Senator Vance. “Action to prevent future disasters is critical, but we must never lose sight of the needs of the Ohioans living in East Palestine and surrounding communities. One day, the TV cameras will leave, and the news cycle will move on, but the needs of those Ohioans will remain. I will never stop fighting to deliver the support they need.”
“It shouldn’t take a massive railroad disaster for elected officials to put partisanship aside and work together for the people we serve – not corporations like Norfolk Southern,”
said Senator Brown. “Rail lobbyists have fought for years to protect their profits at the expense of communities like East Palestine and Steubenville and Sandusky. These commonsense bipartisan safety measures will finally hold big railroad companies accountable, make our railroads and the towns along them safer, and prevent future tragedies, so no community has to suffer like East Palestine again.”
The
Railway Safety Act of 2023
would:
Enhance safety procedures for trains carrying hazardous materials by:
Including new safety requirements and procedures for trains carrying hazardous materials like vinyl chloride
Requiring rail carriers to provide advance notification and information to state emergency response officials about what they are transporting
Creating new requirements to prevent blocked railroad crossings
Mitigating derailment risk with rules for train size and weight
Reduce the risk of wheel bearing failures by:
Establishing requirements for wayside defect detectors
Requiring trains carrying hazardous materials to be scanned by hotbox detectors every 10 miles
Strengthening inspection requirements for rail cars of trains carrying hazardous materials
Require well-trained, two-person crews aboard every train
Force rail carriers to face heightened fines for wrongdoing by:
Substantially increasing the maximum fines USDOT can issue for safety violations
Support communities impacted by rail disasters by:
Expanding HAZMAT training grants for local law enforcement and first responders through increased registration fees paid by Class I railroads
Invest in future safety improvements by:
Providing $22,000,000 to the Federal Railroad Administration for research and development grants regarding wayside defect detectors and other rail priorities
Providing $5,000,000 to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration for expenses related to developing stronger tank car safety features

Title: Hawley Grills Garland for DOJ Attacks on People of Faith, Mar-a-Lago Raid
Date: Wednesday, March 01, 2023

Content:
Today in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) slammed Attorney General Merrick Garland for his lack of accountability regarding the Justice Department’s targeting and subsequent arrests of people of faith, particularly Catholics.
Senator Hawley pressed Garland on the arrest of pro-life activist Mark Houck, including the aggressive measures taken to arrest Houck despite his previous offers to cooperate.
“You are the Attorney General of the United States,”
said Senator Hawley.
“You are in charge of the Justice Department, and yes sir, you are responsible.”
“You used an unbelievable show of force with guns, that I just note, liberals usually decry,”
he continued.
“We’re supposed to hate long guns and assault-style weapons. You’re happy to deploy them against Catholics and innocent children.”
In a second round of questioning, Senator Hawley highlighted a
Washington Post article
detailing a dispute between federal prosecutors and senior FBI agents over the handling of the Mar-a-Lago raid. Federal prosecutors reportedly pressured senior FBI agents into taking an aggressive approach, culminating in the Garland-approved raid on former President Trump’s home.
“The FBI is saying that you overruled them, when it came to raiding ex-President Trump’s personal residence […] So, I guess in light of your earlier testimony just this morning, my question is: how often do you overrule FBI field agents for political purposes?”
asked Senator Hawley.

Title: Hawley Demands Biden Administration Take Immediate Action on Jana Elementary School Cleanup
Date: Wednesday, March 01, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to President Joe Biden slamming the Biden administration for its lack of action on the Jana Elementary School cleanup, expressing his intent to hold all nominees to positions at the Department of Energy until the issue is resolved.
“The lack of urgency from your Administration is outrageous. Children and parents in my state have had their lives upended by the closure of this elementary school,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“These families may not be from wealthy New York suburbs or the Bay Area—and they may not be your party’s donors—but they are just as important as any American family and deserve the same attention from your Administration. I will wait no longer. Until these children get the help they deserve, I will hold all of your Senate-confirmed nominations to the Department of Energy. For as long as it takes.”
“We are well past the time for passing the buck on this issue,”
the letter continues.
“The parents of Hazelwood School District deserve answers—and they deserved them months ago. Direct your Administration to stop pointing fingers and actually fix the problem in front of them.”
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the students and families of the Hazelwood School District. Just last month, Senator Hawley
introduced
the
Justice for Jana Elementary Act, new legislation that would require the cleanup of Jana Elementary School and order the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to test all Hazelwood School District properties.
During the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing in early February, Senator Hawley
pushed
the Department of Energy’s Deputy Secretary David Turk for answers on the radioactive waste found near Jana Elementary School and demanded action to fix the problem.
Senator Hawley also
sent a letter
to USACE Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon in January calling for additional radioactive testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties.
Last October, Senator Hawley
demanded
that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School following reports of contamination, and
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for students and families.

or below:
March 1, 2023
The Honorable Joseph R. Biden Jr.
President of the United States
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest
Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Biden,
In October of last year, I wrote to you regarding the emergency situation at Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Missouri. I called on you to declare a federal emergency and immediately authorize federal relief to children, parents, and teachers who may have been exposed to radiation at that elementary school. But you failed to act, and your Administration has refused to fix the problem.
The lack of urgency from your Administration is outrageous. Children and parents in my state have had their lives upended by the closure of this elementary school. These families may not be from wealthy New York suburbs or the Bay Area—and they may not be your party’s donors—but they are just as important as any American family and deserve the same attention from your Administration. I will wait no longer. Until these children get the help they deserve, I will hold all of your Senate-confirmed nominations to the Department of Energy. For as long as it takes.
As you may know, testing performed over the last year has revealed radioactive contamination on the property of Jana Elementary, a school in Florissant, Missouri and part of the Hazelwood School District. The contamination was caused by the federal government. It stems from activities related to the United States’ early nuclear program and can be found at sites throughout the St. Louis area. Ever since contamination was found, the parents of the Hazelwood School District have requested that testing be performed at other schools in the district. At this point, both the Department of Energy and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have received repeated requests for such testing from myself, from the school district, and from concerned parents.
These requests have been met with equivocation and abdication of responsibility by your Administration. To date, no real action has been taken to ensure the safety of Hazelwood schools. Instead, your Administration has pointed the finger at each other, refusing to give parents a straight answer. In January, my office received a letter from USACE stating that it “does not have authority…to conduct additional testing beyond the scope of the record of decision.” This followed a meeting in which USACE recommended that the school district send a letter to the Department of Energy, so that the Department could authorize further testing.
The school district followed that advice and sent a letter to the Department of Energy. But on February 15, 2023, the Department of Energy responded, directly contradicting USACE’s position and asserting that “USACE may determine if there is a basis for investigation of any or all of [Hazelwood School District]’s properties as vicinity properties.” This inability to decide who is actually responsible for helping the Hazelwood School District was further underlined by Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk, who testified to me in a recent Senate hearing, “I don’t particularly understand where the Army Corps is coming from on this.”
We are well past the time for passing the buck on this issue. The parents of Hazelwood School District deserve answers—and they deserved them months ago. Direct your Administration to stop pointing fingers and actually fix the problem in front of them. As noted, I intend to hold all nominees to positions at the Department of Energy until this issue is resolved.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill Requiring Big Tech Companies Give Children’s Data Back to Parents
Date: Tuesday, February 28, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Parental Data Rights Act, new legislation that would require Big Tech companies to give parents control over their children’s data and hold accountable companies that fail to comply.
Senator Hawley’s legislation follows
news
of a new online tool, Take it Down, that aims to give control to users to remove explicit images and videos of themselves as children from the internet. The tool is reportedly operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and funded in part by Meta. Senator Hawley’s
Parental Data Rights Act
goes even further and requires tech companies to give parents control of the entirety of their children’s data.
“Today’s social media landscape is an increasingly dangerous place for children, as tech companies are far more concerned with user engagement and monetization than with a child’s best interests and long term-term welfare,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Big Tech companies should be beholden to parents, not the other way around, and parents should always have access to their children’s data online. We should put parents back in the driver’s seat and give them the tools to keep kids safe online.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley
introduced
two bills to protect kids online and prevent harm by social media companies. The
Making Age-Verification Technology Uniform, Robust, and Effective Act
(MATURE Act) enforces a minimum age requirement of 16 years old for all users on social media platforms. The
Federal Social Media Research Act
commissions a government report on the harm of social media for kids.
The
Parental Data Rights Act
would:
Require tech companies grant parents access to their children’s data and give them the ability to delete the data, as well as notify them when accounts are created.
Create a private right of action allowing parents to sue companies if they deny parents access to their children’s data, with enhanced penalties if they weren’t notified that their child created an account.

Title: Hawley and Braun Reintroduce Bill Requiring Biden to Declassify Wuhan Lab Leak Intelligence
Date: Monday, February 27, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) reintroduced the
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2023, requiring the Biden administration to declassify intelligence related to any potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the origins of the Covid pandemic.
The Department of Energy
recently concluded
that the COVID-19 pandemic most likely arose from a lab leak, according to a classified intelligence report provided to the White House and certain members of Congress.
“For nearly three years, anyone asking whether COVID-19 originated as a lab leak outbreak was silenced and branded as a conspiracy theorist. Now these prudent skeptics stand vindicated. The Biden administration must immediately declassify all intelligence reports pertaining to the origins of COVID-19 and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The American people deserve to know the truth,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The Biden administration has called the lab leak theory a conspiracy theory from the beginning, and has only started to publicly admit they were wrong as the evidence becomes overwhelming. This bill passed the Senate unanimously in 2021, and since then the Biden administration has continued to keep information about COVID’s origins secret. The American people deserve transparency, free from government censors or media spin. It’s time to declassify everything we know about COVID’s origins and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, now,”
said Senator Braun.
Senators Hawley and Braun’s
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2021
passed the Senate unanimously
in May 2021.
In March 2020, Senator Hawley was the first member of Congress to call for an international investigation into China’s cover-up of the spread of coronavirus and,
in April 2020, introduced legislation to allow American citizens to sue the Chinese government for damages.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) requesting a hearing on federal disaster relief efforts to address the destructive train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio and other transportation-related incidents across the United States. Senator Hawley has also
expressed
serious concern over the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)
decision
to deny Ohio Governor Mike DeWine’s request for federal disaster assistance.
“The American people, not least the local residents of East Palestine and other affected communities, deserve to know how their federal government, including FEMA, is responding. If there are any gaps in our response efforts, it is the duty of this Committee to bring them to light,”
said Senator Hawley.

February 17, 2023
The Honorable Gary Peters
Chairman
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
340 Senate Dirksen Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Chairman Peters,
I write to request that you convene a hearing on federal disaster relief efforts to address transportation-related incidents taking place across the nation. As Members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), we have an obligation to conduct oversight over our federal disaster response, specifically as carried out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It is imperative that we conduct such oversight to study and investigate any potential shortcomings in our disaster response and preparedness, especially given the serious nature of these recent events.
As you may know, there has been significant attention and concern in recent weeks over multiple transportation-related incidents across the nation. Most notably, a train carrying highly toxic and combustible chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio earlier this month, leading residents of that community to evacuate. Authorities have said that multiple chemicals are “known to have been and continue to be” released to the air, surface soil, and surface waters, and subsequent testing has revealed contamination in some Ohio River tributaries. Yet FEMA has so far denied relief. Other recent incidents have prompted similar concerns, including train derailments near Houston, Texas and Detroit, Michigan, as well as a nitric acid spill near Tucson, Arizona.
Events like these threaten our critical infrastructure, disrupt our domestic supply chains, and uproot the lives of normal Americans. They also raise concerns over how the federal government responds to such incidents. The American people, not least the local residents of East Palestine and other affected communities, deserve to know how their federal government, including FEMA, is responding. If there are any gaps in our response efforts, it is the duty of this Committee to bring them to light.
Thank you for your attention and your consideration.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Questions EPA on Risks to Missouri after Ohio Train Derailment
Date: Thursday, February 16, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Director Michael Regan expressing his concerns about the potential impact to Missouri over the train derailment and subsequent disaster unfolding in Ohio.
“This is a terrible tragedy for that community and presents potential far-reaching safety hazards to those living and working downstream of the event. Many in my State of Missouri are now asking whether it is safe to drink their water or consume products made in the region. […] It is imperative that the EPA is transparent with the American people about the risks this disaster may pose to the health, safety, and well-being of those in affected areas,”
wrote Senator Hawley.

February 16, 2023
The Honorable Michael S. Regan
Administrator
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20460
Dear Administrator Regan,
I write to you with great concern over the horrific train derailment and subsequent disaster unfolding in Ohio. This is a terrible tragedy for that community and presents potential far-reaching safety hazards to those living and working downstream of the event. Many in my State of Missouri are now asking whether it is safe to drink their water or consume products made in the region. As the Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), you have an obligation to provide clear guidance to the people of Missouri, and everyone living in affected regions, about the health and safety risks stemming from this disaster.
On February 3, 2023, a freight train carrying vinyl chloride derailed and exploded in East Palestine, Ohio. Since then, emergency crews have conducted a “controlled” burn, which has resulted in hydrogen chloride and phosgene being released into the atmosphere. These are highly toxic chemicals; phosgene was used as a weapon during World War I.
Many in the immediate vicinity have already evacuated, but the release of these toxic chemicals will have far-reaching effects for those who live, work, and drink downstream. There have also been anecdotal reports of pets and livestock dying in the area surrounding the derailment.
Meanwhile, the EPA has failed to provide clear guidance to the people of my State and others who may be exposed to these toxins. It is imperative that the EPA is transparent with the American people about the risks this disaster may pose to the health, safety, and well-being of those in affected areas. It has been nearly two weeks since the train derailed and assurances from your agency are still at a minimum. I ask that you immediately provide the public with an update about what the EPA knows about current risks and in particular provide the following information:
Is there a threat to groundwater safety in any areas in Missouri, especially near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers?
Is there a threat to the health and public safety of Missouri residents who may consume foods or other products produced downstream of the derailment?
Is the EPA monitoring the air and drinking water in Missouri, and if so, what are the results of these studies?
How will this spill impact the lower Mississippi River in Missouri from Birds Point to the Arkansas state line? In particular, does the contamination present a risk to the men and women working in that area?
Please provide a complete list of the chemicals that those in Missouri may be exposed to as a result of this disaster, and their associated risks. Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Op-Ed: ‘Congress must act to keep kids off social media’
Date: Thursday, February 16, 2023

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Feb. 16, 2023 |
Washington Post
This Congress is less than two months old, and a good many Capitol watchers have already written it off as a lost cause. With control split between Republicans and Democrats, can anything get done?
Of course it can. Lawmakers can enact transformative change almost overnight — if they have the will to act. And I can think of at least one nonpartisan issue that deserves this kind of urgency: protecting children online. We should start by establishing an age requirement of 16 for social media.
[…]
It’s not just algorithms and design decisions putting kids at risk. Child sexual abuse material circulates on mainstream platforms such as Twitter, fueling an underground economy run by human traffickers. With millions of exploitation images circulating across the internet — and more every year — the scale of the problem far outpaces law enforcement’s effort to keep up. While Congress talks, children suffer.
In short, these platforms have become dangerous to young people, pushing them toward nihilistic disengagement or despair. Predators and traffickers, like vultures, hover just out of view.
Congress could blunt these harms by simply passing a law that would keep kids off social media until they’re at least 16 and better positioned to use the technologies safely.
Such a law would need teeth, of course. So let’s give it some. We can require real age verification processes and direct the Federal Trade Commission to carry out periodic audits to ensure compliance. And we can empower parents to bring lawsuits against companies that break the rules.
Such a law wouldn’t replace parents. Rather, it would support them. Most of them don’t want their kids on social media at an early age anyway, and many kids join only because their friends have joined. We can protect kids when they are most vulnerable by keeping them off social media during their formative years.

Title: Hawley Delivers National Security Speech ‘China and Ukraine: A Time for Truth’
Date: Thursday, February 16, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks at the Heritage Foundation in a speech entitled, “China and Ukraine: A Time for Truth.” The discussion focused on developing a defense policy that prioritizes our biggest threat, China; challenges to the consensus on Ukraine; and safeguards for Americans at home.
Remarks as prepared can be found below.
China and Ukraine: A Time for Truth
Three years ago, in October of 2019, I went to visit Hong Kong.
It wasn’t a standard, ceremonial sort of visit. In fact, the State Department wasn’t a big fan of my going there at all.
I went there in the midst of major protests against the Chinese government. Beijing had originally promised the people of Hong Kong that, once the city passed into Chinese control, it would keep its unique freedoms. “One country, two systems.” Or so it went.
But that was a lie.
As soon as it could, the Chinese Communist Party cracked down on Hong Kong with a draconian “national security law” to crush any dissent. Xi Jinping’s way would be the only way.
I wanted to see what was happening for myself.
When I was there, I saw cars blazing in the streets, and protestors calling to “free Hong Kong.” I heard the explosions. I saw Chinese riot police, facing off with young men and women struggling for freedom.
I made friends there. Many of them went to prison, like Joshua Wong and Jimmy Lai.
I’ll never forget that trip. Because there I was able to see, firsthand, the nightmare that the Chinese Communist Party offers the world.
In the Hong Kong crackdown, we saw the real face of Chinese tyranny. We all may see it again soon in Taiwan.
And we may not be able to do anything about it.
It’s not popular to say that openly. Dozens of lawmakers and experts and talking heads have claimed an invasion of Taiwan simply won’t happen—or if it does, that we can prevail. That China will be too afraid to challenge us or won’t.
Instead they prefer to tell a familiar and comforting story, where winning the Cold War meant that we could—police the world for all time.
They want us to believe that our military might is infinite, that American power faces no real constraints, and that we ought to use it to reshape the world.
They want us to believe we can fight an endless proxy war in Ukraine. And somehow, this won’t impact our ability to deter China from invading Taiwan.
Curiously enough, this story of American omnicompetence isn’t really partisan. It’s told both by neoconservatives on the right, and liberal globalists on the left. Together they make up the “Uniparty”—the D.C. establishment that transcends all changing administrations.
It’s hard to challenge the Uniparty. They’ve gotten very good at telling their favorite story. That’s why anyone who questions them gets called “anti-American” or “Vladimir Putin’s puppet” from a hundred different quarters.
But today, I want to tell you something else. I want to tell the truth.
And the truth is that Americans have been sold a bill of goods. Our current foreign policy isn’t working.
It is not working for the American people. It’s cost many of them their jobs, their towns, their communities—all thanks to the bad trade deals that we were promised would make us all richer.
That didn’t work out so well for the people of my state. Or for anyone who witnessed their manufacturing job shipped overseas.
But our current foreign policy isn’t even working according to its own standards. It’s falling apart at the seams, with the Uniparty doing its level best to patch it together by cutting blank checks to other countries.
None of that is enough. Because we’re simply overcommitted, caught in the grip of an ideology of liberal empire. Our Uniparty ideology tells us we’re on the right side of history, and tough tradeoffs don’t exist.
We have a lot of military power on our side. But it isn’t deployed where it should be, and the world is about to face the consequences.
So let me share another truth: As things stand right now, if China invades Taiwan in the next few years, they will likely prevail.
I will say it again.
We stand at an inflection point today. And it is time for a real change.
It is time to adopt a truly nationalist foreign policy.
*        *        *
We hear a lot these days about something called the, “rules-based international order.” Politicians, and so-called experts, invoke it whenever they want us to send another few billion dollars overseas.
Now, the “rules-based international order” isn’t some kingdom of heaven. It is a kind of American liberal empire. It’s founded on the assumption that, if we set up the economic rules of the game just so, the people at the top get a lot richer, and maybe that’ll trickle down to everybody else. So it goes.
And as an added bonus, we’ll eventually make the world over in the image of New York and Silicon Valley. Free minds and free markets, or something like that.
Once upon a time, this sounded good. But it was a bad plan from the start.
All the way back in December 2001, we admitted China into the World Trade Organization. The Uniparty wanted to believe that this would make us all richer, that we could offshore jobs and import cheap junk without undermining our own prosperity.
They also wanted to believe that maybe we could democratize China. Maybe, if we brought China into the global economic order, horrors like Tiananmen Square could be a thing of the past.
That was a catastrophic mistake.
“One country, two systems” wasn’t China’s first broken promise. After joining the WTO, China cheated. The Chinese Communist Party took full advantage of its access to global markets to enrich itself, but simultaneously shielded its own economy from foreign competition.
Americans paid the price. Good, blue-collar jobs—jobs that once provided American workers with a living wage—were siphoned off overseas.
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party got rich as the Chinese economy boomed. They built their military on the backs of America’s middle class. Now, that military—not only massive but increasingly modernized—is poised for a cross-Strait invasion of Taiwan.
What did our leadership do while all this was happening? Exactly the wrong things.
While China was prospering and American towns were withering away, the Uniparty set its sights on the Middle East. We heard a lot about making the world safe for democracy, about how American blood and treasure could turn these nations into images of the West.
That imperial project failed. It failed disastrously. We invested billions of dollars there and lost hundreds of American lives, all while China rose unimpeded. And the people responsible are all still members of the D.C. establishment in good standing. Nobody was ever held accountable.
In the end, regime change didn’t work.
But the Uniparty doesn’t learn. And now we’re hearing their same siren song again. This time it’s about Ukraine. If only we send a few more weapons, send a few more billion dollars …we’ll really have a rules-based international order.
Maybe we should do some more nation-building. Maybe we can even force a regime change in Russia. All ideas the Uniparty is excited about.
They’re nonsense. They’re the wrong ideas at the wrong time.
The only problem is, we should have seen the threat of China coming years ago. But the Uniparty didn’t. And they still aren’t taking it seriously, even now.
Right now, we have Uniparty leaders and former NATO brass telling us that defending Ukraine is basically the same thing as deterring China. That if one dictator is allowed to seize territory by force, it’ll embolden others, and so stopping Vladimir Putin is basically the same thing as stopping Xi Jinping.
This is the Uniparty’s magical thinking at work. It’s rooted in the fanciful idea that if we want to stop tyrants, all we need to do is show them we’re not afraid. That if we stand up to one bully, all the others will just slink away.
That’s Hollywood. That’s not reality.
In the real world, we have limited military resources, and our adversaries know it.
The Chinese Communist Party understands that if our resources are tied up in Ukraine, those are resources we can’t use to deter a Taiwan invasion. As Napoleon said, “If you want to take Vienna, take Vienna.” China wants control of the Indo-Pacific, and we must stop them there.
And yet Congress has poured billions of dollars into Ukrainian defenses, at a time when the American people are still dealing with sky-high inflation. And there’s no end in sight.
That’s not the core problem, though. The core problem is that our actions in Ukraine are directly affecting our ability to project force elsewhere. Specifically, to deter China in the Pacific.
Let’s consider our position.
For starters, the more U.S. resources we devote to Europe, the fewer we have available to strengthen deterrence in the Pacific. For some things, like heavy armor units, that may not matter much. But it matters a lot for the capabilities we need to deter China from invading Taiwan.
Both Ukraine and Taiwan require many of the same weapons, including things like Javelin and Stinger missiles.
And our industrial base is strapped for capacity. That’s because we need to draw on many of the same suppliers for the defense of both Ukraine and Taiwan.
We’re doing our best to increase production, but that will take years.
All of this means that when we pour our military power into Ukraine, that decision comes at a cost.
As a result, we cannot meet Ukrainian, Taiwanese, and our own military requirements all at the same time, for the foreseeable future.
In other words, we can’t do everything.
And, frankly, we shouldn’t have to. Some of the world’s wealthiest nations are our allies in Europe. But right now, we’re the only ones doing the heavy lifting.
In fact, we’ve sent more weapons to Ukraine than all of Europe has, combined. And those choices are weakening us in the one place—the Pacific—where we require strength.
The Uniparty’s way is not sustainable. It is a path to failure.
And this is why China is now positioned to strike with overwhelming force and seize Taiwan.
Invading Taiwan has been Xi Jinping’s goal for years. He wants control of the Pacific. He is determined to cement his place in Chinese history.
Less than six months ago, before the Chinese Communist Party’s Congress in Beijing, Xi declared that “the historical wheels of national reunification and national rejuvenation are rolling forward, and the complete reunification of the motherland must be achieved[.]”
We know this. But we haven’t taken him seriously enough.
And if we don’t stop him – if we can’t – nothing we do elsewhere will matter much.
*        *        *
So what happens, if we wake up tomorrow and an invasion has begun? What can America do about it?
Once again, let’s assess our strategic position—this time in the Pacific.
Well, we’ve got plenty of aircraft. But they’re concentrated at a small number of air bases, which makes them easy targets. And China has invested in weapons and sensors that we haven’t fielded, undercutting our air power advantage.
We have carrier strike groups. But it’s not clear how they’ll help us defeat a Chinese invasion. China has built up defenses designed to neutralize them early in a fight, or keep them so far away they won’t be useful.
We do have an undersea advantage. But we’ve only got so many submarines, we’ve only got so many torpedoes and other weapons to fire from them, and we’ve only got so many places to reload or refit them. Those are hard limits.
We’re also at risk ourselves, especially our forces in Guam. Guam isn’t well defended against China’s missiles—to say nothing of Chinese special operations forces.
And I haven’t even mentioned China’s nuclear arsenal, which of course is always looming in the background. Meanwhile, our own military space architecture is dangerously vulnerable, and our logistics forces are already overstretched.
So let’s suppose the worst happens. Suppose China invades and seizes Taiwan. We try to stop it, but our forces are defeated and the island is lost.
What would that mean?
If China conquers Taiwan, Xi and the Chinese Communist Party will view it as a world-historical victory. They will see it as the dawn of a “Chinese century” that puts the lie to America’s promise of liberty.
And Americans will confront a new, terrifying reality.
Every American will feel it. The price hikes and disruptions we’ve seen in recent years will pale in comparison.
Product shortages will be commonplace—shortages of everything from basic medicine to consumer electronics. According to some estimates, a war over Taiwan would send us into a deep recession with no clear way out, since huge swaths of our economy run on Taiwanese semiconductors.
But the economic consequences are just the start.
If China takes Taiwan, it will be able to station its own military forces there. It can then use its position as a springboard for further conquest and intimidation—against Japan, the Philippines, and other Pacific islands, like Guam and the Northern Marianas.
Our grandparents fought and bled to liberate those islands during the Second World War. Now they’re under threat again, from a new imperially-minded power.
As Asia’s new reigning power, China could restrict U.S. trade in the region—perhaps block it altogether. Maybe we’ll be allowed in, but only on terms favorable to China.
China exploited the trade system once before. They can do it again.
There’s more. We recently witnessed a Chinese spy balloon cruise across the American heartland.  But things can get much worse.
Imagine a world where Chinese warships patrol Hawaiian waters, and Chinese submarines stalk the California coastline. A world where the People’s Liberation Army has military bases in Central and South America. A world where Chinese forces operate freely in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.
This is a dark future. And it is an increasingly plausible future.
But it is not an inevitable future.
There may still be time to chart a different course—if our leaders have the resolve to do so.
*        *        *
That different course is a nationalist foreign policy. A foreign policy in the spirit of Alexander Hamilton and Theodore Roosevelt.
A nationalist foreign policy places America’s interests first. And deterring China from seizing Taiwan should be America’s top priority.
That means our defense spending should be concentrated on deterrence in the Pacific. No more “divest to invest” in the Indo-Pacific. No more unfunded priorities from INDOPACOM. Instead, we should be stockpiling weapons, dispersing our forces in the Indo-Pacific, and accelerating late-stage development of space, cyber, and other critical capabilities, like the B-21 strategic bomber.
None of this is news, but we’re years behind schedule.
Strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific means scaling back our military commitments elsewhere. That brings us to Europe.
What we need is a new burden-sharing arrangement within NATO. Our NATO allies should lead in arming Ukraine. And they should also take responsibility for defending Europe itself, relying on the U.S. only for extended nuclear deterrence and a few other capabilities.
This will free up American resources for deterring China. It’ll also ensure that NATO allies can deter Russia or defend themselves with limited U.S. support if our forces are drawn to a crisis or conflict in the Pacific.
This is vital because, as our own 2018 and 2022 National Defense Strategies made clear, we can’t fight and win major wars in Asia and Europe at the same time.
What concrete steps can we take toward this new burden-sharing arrangement?
First, we should cut off U.S. military aid to Ukraine, until our European allies step up. That won’t happen so long as we’re doing their job for them.
Second, we should clarify the stakes for our European allies. They should know we won’t be able to fully defend them if a conflict with China breaks out. We must make clear that, given the Chinese threat and the need for deterrence, we will be forced to withhold forces from any direct conflict with Russia. So even if U.S. forces aren’t at war in the Pacific, Europe still can’t count on us like they used to.
We should begin reducing U.S. force levels in Europe. And we should keep cutting, until we’re supporting NATO’s defenses with only those capabilities we don’t need to deter China, and with our nuclear arsenal. Our European allies can make up the difference. They must take the lead in Europe’s conventional defense.
This is what a real burden-sharing arrangement looks like. This is how we safeguard our interests in Europe, while also deterring China in Asia.
Finally, the United States should arm Taiwan. But U.S. aid should be conditioned on Taiwan increasing defense spending and embracing an asymmetric defense strategy. If Taiwan won’t defend itself, how can they expect Americans to fight and die on their behalf? Taiwan must step up too.
*        *        *
The Uniparty isn’t going to like this message. They’ll probably call it “Russian propaganda,” or some other hogwash.
But when I first came to the Senate, I took an oath. I swore to “well and faithfully discharge the duties” of my office. I take that oath very seriously.
And to me, faithfully discharging the duties of my office means defending America.
Not something called the “rules-based international order.” I mean America.
It also means telling the American people the truth. Even the hard and painful truth.
This is the heart of a nationalist foreign policy—clear-eyed realism, in the service of the American people.
Changing our course will not be easy. It will take sacrifices. And it will require difficult choices.
But America has risen to countless challenges before. And I believe we can do so again.
Right now—today—we can start looking reality in the eye. We can stand up to the threat that we—and Taiwan—currently face. We can make those difficult choices.
We can choose truth over comfort.
And for the sake of the world our sons and daughters will live in, I pray we will.

Title: Hawley Sends New Letter Demanding Answers on Federal Funding of Washington University Pediatric Transgender Clinic
Date: Thursday, February 16, 2023

Content:
As part of his
ongoing investigation, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a new letter
to Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Dr. Andrew Martin and BJC HealthCare President and CEO Richard Liekweg today, requesting information about the receipt and use of federal funds in connection with The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital.
“I appreciate the University’s promise to investigate these claims thoroughly and accommodate congressional oversight requests,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“I now write to request specific information and records relevant to the receipt and use of federal funds in connection with the Transgender Center.”
He continued,
“Federal taxpayer dollars should never be used to perform gender-transition procedures on minors. If the Center has used federal funds for these purposes, the American people should know.”
Yesterday, Senator Hawley
introduced legislation
that would allow those who were harmed by gender-transition procedures as minors to bring lawsuits against the participating individuals and entities. His bill would also prohibit federal funding to go to any pediatric gender clinic, to any university or hospital that is affiliated with a pediatric gender clinic, and for any gender-transition procedure performed on minors.
Last week, upon announcing his investigation, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the university chancellor, hospital president, and the center’s co-directors demanding the institutions immediately take steps to preserve all records, written and electronic, regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors since the opening of the Center.
Read his new letter
here
or below:
February 16, 2023
Dr. Andrew D. Martin
Chancellor
Washington University in St. Louis
1 Brookings Dr.
St. Louis, MO 63130
Richard J. Liekweg
President and CEO
BJC HealthCare
4901 Forest Park Avenue
St. Louis, Missouri 63108
Dr. Martin and Mr. Liekweg:
I write to follow up on my letter dated February 9, 2023 raising concerns about recent allegations of egregious abuses of minors and potential at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. As I indicated in that letter, the University, the hospital, and the clinic have an obligation to preserve all records regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors at the Center. I appreciate the University’s promise to investigate these claims thoroughly and accommodate congressional oversight requests. I now write to request specific information and records relevant to the receipt and use of federal funds in connection with the Transgender Center.
Federal taxpayer dollars should never be used to perform gender-transition procedures on minors. If the Center has used federal funds for these purposes, the American people should know. In particular, I was greatly concerned to review a whistleblower’s allegations that employees at the Center inappropriately coded certain services when seeking reimbursement from federal agencies. Whether this was done to cover up irresponsible treatment or simply to bilk the federal government for more money has yet to be determined. In either case, the employees’ conduct would be a straightforward case of fraud, a clear violation of the False Claims Act, and potential grounds for exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
The federal government also has an obligation to protect individuals’ civil rights. The irreversible sterilization or physical disfigurement of minors, without their informed consent or without their parents’ informed consent, is a gross violation of civil rights and basic human rights. I also intend to investigate whether any employee of the Center had his or her federal conscience rights violated by the Center.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by March 2, 2023. For purposes of this document production request, the term “University” means Washington University, the term “Hospital” means The St. Louis Children’s Hospital, and the term “Transgender Center” means The Washington University Transgender Center.
1. A full accounting of all federal funds received by the University, the Hospital, and the Transgender Center that have ultimately flowed to the Transgender Center since its inception.
2. A full accounting of all funding, public and private, that the Transgender Center receives, including an itemized list of funding from:
a.  The federal government, including research grants and insurance reimbursements;
b.  The University;
c.  The Hospital;
d.  Pharmaceutical companies;
e.  Medical associations;
f.  Private donors (over $1000); and
g.  Any other non-profit organizations.
3. All copies of bills, grant requests, or any other documents submitted or sent by the Transgender Center, or on its behalf, to the federal government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and any of its subagencies.
4. All receipts of federal disbursements made to the Transgender Center, or to an entity that passed along these disbursements to the Transgender Center, including those disbursed under any program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or any of its subagencies.
5. All communications between the Transgender Center’s employees and federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and any of its subagencies.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Protect Our Kids from Child Abuse: New Hawley Bill Holds Youth Trans Clinics Accountable
Date: Wednesday, February 15, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Protecting Our Kids from Child Abuse Act, new legislation that would allow those who were harmed by gender-transition procedures as minors to bring lawsuits against the participating individuals and entities.
“What the American people are seeing take place at pediatric gender clinics in St. Louis and across the nation is appalling,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Children who are harmed by these dangerous procedures, which are often irreversible and sterilizing, will now be able to fight back against those who perpetrated their abuse. And federal taxpayers will no longer be forced to foot the bill for abusive treatment.”
Last week, Senator Hawley
announced
an investigation into whistleblower allegations of child abuse and potential malpractice at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. He also
wrote
to the university’s chancellor, hospital president, and the center’s co-directors requesting information and answers regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors since the opening of the Center.
The
Protecting Our Kids from Child Abuse Act
would:
Create a private right of action for individuals who were harmed by a gender-transition procedure performed on them when they were minors.
The following individuals and entities would be liable for damages: a pediatric gender clinic where the procedure was performed; a medical practitioner who performed the procedure or was employed by the clinic; and a university or hospital that is affiliated with the clinic.
Prohibit federal funding to any pediatric gender clinic, to any university or hospital that is affiliated with a pediatric gender clinic, and for any gender-transition procedure performed on minors.

Title: NEW: Hawley Introduces Two Bills to Protect Kids Online, Fight Back Against Big Tech
Date: Tuesday, February 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced two bills to protect kids online and prevent harm by social media companies. The
Making Age-Verification Technology Uniform, Robust, and Effective Act
(MATURE Act)
would enforce a minimum age requirement of 16 years old for all users on social media platforms, and the
Federal Social Media Research Act
would commission a government report on the harm of social media for kids.
“Children suffer every day from the effects of social media. At best, Big Tech companies are neglecting our children’s health and monetizing their personal information. At worst, they are complicit in their exploitation and manipulation. It’s time to give parents the weapons they need to strike back,”
said Senator Hawley.
“That starts with an age restriction for social media. And it’s long past time for well-funded research on the scale of the problem. We must set the precedent that these companies can no longer take advantage of our children.”
The
MATURE Act
would:
Prohibit social media companies from offering accounts to users under age 16, and
Hold social media companies accountable by creating an audit process and a private right of action.
The
Federal Social Media Research Act
would:
Commission a report on the harms of social media, and
Fully fund a longitudinal study to track social media’s effects on children over 10 years.

Title: NEW: Hawley Introduces Bill Requiring Cleanup of Jana Elementary, Testing for Entire Hazelwood School District
Date: Tuesday, February 14, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Justice for Jana Elementary Act, new legislation that would require the cleanup of Jana Elementary School and order the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to test all Hazelwood School District properties.
“Hazardous radioactive contamination has no place in schools,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Students and parents of Jana Elementary and the Hazelwood School District deserve to know that their schools are safe. Federal authorities created this problem years ago and refused to fix it. Now the federal government must take responsibility and make things right.”
Senator Hawley has consistently advocated on behalf of the students and families of the Hazelwood School District. Two weeks ago, during the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing, Senator Hawley
pushed
the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Deputy Secretary David Turk for answers on the radioactive waste found near Jana Elementary School and demanded action be taken to fix the problem.
Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to USACE Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon last month calling for additional radioactive testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties.
Last October, Senator Hawley
demanded
that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School following reports of contamination, and
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for students and families.
View the bill text
here.
The
Justice for Jana Elementary Act
would:
Order the USACE to establish new remediation goals to clean up Jana Elementary
Order the USACE to test all Hazelwood School District schools for radioactive contaminants
Create a fund to permit localities with schools impacted by Manhattan Project-era atomic programs to request financial assistance for radioactive testing or construction of new school facilities; and
Order the DOE to review all testing performed at Jana Elementary and determine if the testing was reliable.

Title: Hawley Reintroduces Bill to Protect Kids, Toughen Sentences for Child Porn Offenders
Date: Thursday, February 09, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) reintroduced the
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act, a bill that both toughens the sentence for possessing child pornography and stops judges from sentencing offenders below the federal guidelines.
The epidemic of child pornography in the United States has exploded. Just over a decade ago, the number of images of child sexual abuse material online was less than 1 million. That number grew to 45 million
in 2018, and to 85 million
in 2021.
“We need to do more to protect our children. The problem of child pornography has grown exponentially worse over the years – in part because the existing penalties are too weak, and because too many judges are issuing lenient sentences,”
said Senator Hawley. “Congress must act now to ensure tougher penalties are enforced against these criminals.”
By federal statute, judges are required to sentence criminals within ranges set by the federal “Sentencing Guidelines,” subject to some exceptions. In 2003, Congress passed the original
PROTECT Act
to curtail the exceptions—and enhance the penalties—in child pornography cases.
The
PROTECT Act
worked. But the Supreme Court gutted it in 2005, in
United States v. Booker, a controversial 5-4 decision. Since then, some federal judges have used their discretion to
impose lenient sentences
on child porn offenders. Senator Hawley’s bill would prevent judges from doing so in the future.
More recently, Senator Hawley
introduced
this bill in March of 2022. It was
blocked by Democrats
upon Senator Hawley’s request for unanimous consent.
The
PROTECT Act of 2023
would:
Enhance the penalties for possessing child pornography. Federal law imposes a 5-year mandatory-minimum for receiving child pornography but not for possessing it. There is no meaningful difference between possession and receipt. This change will align the penalties and apply a 5-year mandatory minimum to both offenses to ensure that every child pornography offender goes to jail.
Make the Guidelines binding again. The Supreme Court declared in United States v. Booker that the Guidelines cannot be binding if based on facts found by a judge after trial. This bill would prohibit judges from sentencing below the Guidelines range for facts found during trial or admitted by the defendant. This change will ensure that judges impose tougher sentences on child pornography offenders.

Title: Hawley Outlines Investigation of Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital:  ‘Accountability is coming’
Date: Thursday, February 09, 2023

Content:
Following the announcement by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today that he is launching an
investigation
into potential malpractice regarding minors at The Washington University
Transgender Center
at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, Senator Hawley has sent a
new letter tonight
to the university chancellor, hospital president, and the center’s co-directors.
“Starting immediately, your institutions must take steps to preserve all records, written and electronic, regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors since the opening of the Center,”
the Senator wrote. “Additional oversight inquiries and outreach will follow.”
His letter went on
to reference
additional reporting
about the Center’s practices, saying today’s report “builds on recent revelations that the Center counseled educational authorities to conceal information from parents regarding their children’s cross-gender identification. […] Encouraging teachers to lie to children’s parents is unconscionable. If even a fraction of the whistleblower’s new allegations is corroborated, the Center should be immediately shut down.”
Senator Hawley
spoke with
Chancellor Andrew D. Martin of Washington University in St. Louis today, and confirmed they will fully cooperate with the investigation. The Senator was also
assured
that the whistleblower will be fully protected from retaliation.
Read the full letter
here
and below:
February 9, 2023
Dr. Andrew D. Martin
Chancellor
Washington University in St. Louis
1 Brookings Dr.
St. Louis, MO 63130
Trish M. Lollo
President
St. Louis Children’s Hospital
1 Children’s Place
St. Louis, MO 63110
Chancellor Martin and President Lollo:
Earlier today, an extraordinary whistleblower report was published alleging egregious abuses of minors, and potential medical malpractice, at The Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. That report presented substantial evidence that, like so many other pediatric gender clinics across the United States, this Missouri-based clinic appears to have been operating without transparency, oversight, and accountability—and causing devastating harm to children in the process.
Accountability is coming. Today, my office is launching an investigation into the Center’s treatment practices in order to present American taxpayers and parents with all the facts relevant to policymaking and medical treatment decisions. Starting immediately, your institutions must take steps to preserve all records, written and electronic, regarding gender-related treatments performed on minors since the opening of the Center. Additional oversight inquiries and outreach will follow.
Today’s report, published in The Free Press, featured the testimony of a whistleblower who worked at the Center for four years, and who claims to have witnessed firsthand the manipulation of minors and their parents by medical professionals at the Center. The whistleblower reported that the Center’s “working assumption” was to pursue aggressive and early intervention, despite research indicating that the vast majority of children with cross-gender identification desist by puberty. The whistleblower further detailed examples of the Center’s staff subverting parents’ wishes regarding their child’s medical treatment, including by testifying against them in court, and pressuring reluctant staff to “get on board, or get out.”
This report builds on recent revelations that the Center counseled educational authorities to conceal information from parents regarding their children’s cross-gender identification. On January 17, 2023, news reports indicated that Parkway School District in St. Louis County has been concealing students’ “chest-binding” from their parents—and that the Center encouraged such concealment. Encouraging teachers to lie to children’s parents is unconscionable. If even a fraction of the whistleblower’s new allegations is corroborated, the Center should be immediately shut down.
As Senator for the State of Missouri, it is my responsibility to fully investigate these serious allegations. In addition to preserving all documents regarding gender-related clinical treatments performed by the Center on minors, please immediately provide my office with responses to the following questions, consistent with federal privacy protections for patients. Additional questions will follow.

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from DHS on China’s Spy Activities, Slams Lack of Transparency from Biden
Date: Wednesday, February 08, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding answers on the Chinese government’s espionage efforts within the United States, slamming the Biden administration for hiding these efforts from the American people.
“For an entire week, the Biden Administration allowed the Chinese government to fly a surveillance balloon across the United States,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“The balloon flew over states like Montana, which houses nuclear missile silos, and my own state of Missouri, which is home to our fleet of nuclear-capable B-2 bombers stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base. Administration officials also reportedly concealed the balloon’s existence from the public until local media reports forced their hand.”
“In other words, if no one had seen the balloon, there is every reason to believe this Administration would have kept it a secret,”
the letter continues.
“Even then, the Administration proved reluctant to speak to Americans about the Chinese surveillance asset floating above their homes. Indeed, only after numerous public sightings and mounting pressure did the Pentagon hold a briefing. This raises an obvious question: What else does the Biden administration know about China’s espionage efforts that it is hiding from the American public?”
Senator Hawley also described several known Chinese spy activities in the United States and requested further information from Secretary Mayorkas on the specific methods used by the Chinese government to spy on targets in the homeland, requesting responses by Feb. 17, 2023.
Last week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) demanding an investigation into the Chinese surveillance balloon and slamming the Biden Administration’s lack of action.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
February 8, 2023
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretary Mayorkas:
The American people deserve transparency. For an entire week, the Biden Administration allowed the Chinese government to fly a surveillance balloon across the United States. The balloon flew over states like Montana, which houses nuclear missile silos, and my own state of Missouri, which is home to our fleet of nuclear-capable B-2 bombers stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base. Administration officials also reportedly concealed the balloon’s existence from the public until local media reports forced their hand. Naturally, the American people are infuriated. They also want to know how else the Chinese government is spying on our homeland—and whether their own government would even tell them if it knew.
Reports state that the White House only opted to publicly disclose its knowledge of the Chinese surveillance balloon after a local Montana paper published a picture of it. In other words, if no one had seen the balloon, there is every reason to believe this Administration would have kept it a secret. Even then, the Administration proved reluctant to speak to Americans about the Chinese surveillance asset floating above their homes. Indeed, only after numerous public sightings and mounting pressure did the Pentagon hold a briefing. This raises an obvious question: What else does the Biden administration know about China’s espionage efforts that it is hiding from the American public?
The surveillance balloon is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to China’s spy activities in the U.S. homeland. Recently, Americans learned that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had established police stations in the United States to monitor and harass Chinese dissidents and Chinese Americans. Confucius Institutes—CCP-backed organizations used to gather intelligence and spread propaganda on U.S. campuses—are proliferating under different names at American colleges, universities, and even grade schools. China is also buying up our farmland to spy on nearby military installations. And of course, TikTok, whose parent company is China-based ByteDance, allows the Chinese government to access the personal data of millions of American civilians. All this is in addition to the traditional methods that state actors use to gather intelligence, such as spy satellites and cyber espionage.
The events of the past week have served as a poignant reminder that the CCP’s surveillance ambitions do not stop at China’s borders. The CCP uses a wide variety of methods to collect intelligence both inside China and abroad, including in the United States. Americans are understandably concerned about the myriad ways by which the Chinese government is actively spying on them—and they have a right to know more. No doubt, some of the Chinese government’s methods may need to be kept secret to preserve our ability to counter, deceive, or replicate them. Many others, however, should be revealable in a manner that protects U.S. sources and methods, while allowing the American people to understand the lengths to which Beijing will go to gather information on them, their families, their communities, and our nation.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by February 17, 2023:
A comprehensive list of methods used by the Chinese government to spy on targets in the U.S. homeland, including but not limited to satellites, aircraft, naval vessels, cyber capabilities, social media, and Chinese personnel in the United States, such as diplomats, intelligence officers, police, Confucius Institute staff, or others.
A comprehensive list of methods used by the Chinese government to spy on U.S. military installations, servicemembers, and related targets in the U.S. homeland, including methods identified in your previous answers as well as land purchases or other techniques.
A detailed description of Chinese intelligence collection priorities and objectives, including analyses of how Chinese intelligence collection priorities, objectives, and capabilities have changed over the past decade.
You may respond in a classified format if necessary to protect U.S. sources and methods. If you choose to do so, please be prepared to explain in detail why you made this decision. Classification can be a useful tool, but it can also have tremendous costs: not least, preventing the American people from understanding the full extent of Chinese surveillance operations here in the U.S. homeland.
Thank you for your attention.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley to Introduce Resolution Condemning Chinese Communist Party over Spy Balloon Incident
Date: Wednesday, February 08, 2023

Content:
Following his
letter
to the Department of Homeland Security requesting information on China’s spy activities, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will
introduce a Senate resolution
to condemn the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for its blatant violation of U.S. airspace and call for transparency regarding the Chinese surveillance balloon incident.
Senator Hawley said, “The CCP’s deployment of a surveillance balloon into U.S. airspace was a gross violation of American sovereignty and cannot be tolerated. All members of the U.S. Senate should condemn China’s actions and expect full transparency about the details of this incident.”
The resolution would:
Specifically condemn the CCP’s recent invasion of U.S. airspace to conduct surveillance;
Affirm that it is U.S. policy to protect our airspace from foreign and hostile actors; and
Call for transparency from the Biden Administration regarding this incident and all other attempts by the CCP to spy on U.S. citizens and territories.

to Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) demanding an investigation into the Chinese surveillance balloon and slamming the Biden Administration’s lack of action.
“As confirmed today by the Pentagon, there is currently a Chinese surveillance balloon moving across the United States. […] Yet rather than shooting down or otherwise disabling this high-altitude balloon, the Biden Administration is merely ‘monitoring the situation’ and referring reporters to the Chinese government for answers,”
said Senator Hawley.
He continued, “This is a gross violation of American sovereignty. China’s foray into America’s sovereign airspace is deeply disturbing and calls for an immediate investigation.”

February 3, 2023
The Honorable Gary Peters
Chairman
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
340 Senate Dirksen Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Chairman Peters,
I write to request that you expeditiously convene a hearing on troubling reports that the Chinese government has launched a surveillance balloon over the United States to spy on our nuclear capabilities. As Members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), we have an obligation to obtain a full understanding of the surveillance that the Chinese government is currently conducting in gross violation of U.S. airspace and to understand the Biden Administration’s baffling response thus far.
As confirmed today by the Pentagon, there is currently a Chinese surveillance balloon moving across the United States. It appears that the balloon is in the vicinity of U.S. military installations that host intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. The Chinese Communist Government claims this is merely a “civilian airship” that has deviated from its course.
But we know that is a lie. The Pentagon has confirmed that the balloon is “maneuverable” and is currently somewhere over the center of the continental United States—in violation of U.S. airspace and international law. Pentagon spokesman U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said the balloon is expected to continue to operate over U.S. airspace “for a few days.” Yet rather than shooting down or otherwise disabling this high-altitude balloon, the Biden Administration is merely “monitoring the situation” and referring reporters to the Chinese government for answers.
This is a gross violation of American sovereignty. China’s foray into America’s sovereign airspace is deeply disturbing and calls for an immediate investigation. This is a matter of homeland security, and we should hear from senior members of the Biden Administration to understand their response, or lack thereof, so far. The American people are demanding answers.
Sincerely,
U.S. Senator
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from DOE on Radioactive Waste Found Near Jana Elementary
Date: Thursday, February 02, 2023

Content:
During his first appearance in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) pushed the Department of Energy’s Deputy Secretary David Turk for answers about radioactive waste found near Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District of Florissant, Mo.
“With all due respect, I’m not particularly interested in conversations, I’m interested in getting a result here,”
Senator Hawley said.
“These parents have been waiting for years […] to get some clean up done. I don’t think it’s too much to ask, that this school district, beginning with Jana Elementary, but the entire school district, get proper clean-up done and these kids be able to go to school in a place that doesn’t have radioactive waste within 600 feet of their school, or maybe in the building itself.”
Last month, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon calling for additional radioactive testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties.
Last October, Senator Hawley
demanded
that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School following reports of contamination, and
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for students and families.

Title: New Hawley Bill Exempts Social Security and Medicare from Debt Ceiling
Date: Wednesday, February 01, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Keep Our Promises Act
to exempt Social Security and Medicare from the debt ceiling.
Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries must be confident that their benefits will be paid in full and on time. Senator Hawley’s legislation will ensure these programs are never used as leverage in negotiations over the debt limit.
“Social Security and Medicare are not bargaining chips. These are promises we’ve made to the American people, and we must not break them,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
Keep Our Promises Act
would:
Exempt Social Security and Medicare from the statutory debt limit.
Authorize the Treasury Department, when the statutory debt limit is reached, to issue as much additional debt as necessary to fully fund Social Security and Medicare and disperse on-time benefits to America’s seniors.
Permit the Treasury Department to use this authority in all future debt limit episodes, thereby permanently insulating Social Security and Medicare from any impact of a debt ceiling standoff.

Title: NEW: Hawley Introduces Bill to Protect Families from Big Pharma, Cap Insulin Prices
Date: Monday, January 30, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Cap Insulin Prices Act, new legislation to reduce the price of insulin and protect families from Big Pharma.
“Insulin was discovered more than a century ago, yet too many Americans who rely on it have difficulty paying for it,”
said Senator Hawley. “The price of insulin is straining household budgets – at a time when inflation is already squeezing families – which can lead to rationing, and even the need for more expensive treatments down the line. Patients and their families deserve better.”
More than half a million Missourians live with diabetes, many of whom rely on insulin to manage their chronic disease.

The
Cap Insulin Prices Act
would:
Set a $25 out-of-pocket cap for a monthly supply of insulin through private health plans.
Reduce to $25 the out-of-pocket cap for a monthly supply of insulin through Medicare.
Prohibit health plans from using prior authorization and step-therapy to steer patients to insulin products that are not best for them.

Title: Hawley Demands OMB Expedite Implementation of TikTok Ban on Government Devices
Date: Friday, January 27, 2023

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young, demanding the swift implementation of the TikTok ban on government devices, as required by his recently passed legislation, the
No TikTok on Government Devices Act.
“I write to urge the Biden Administration to expeditiously implement the recently enacted No TikTok on Government Devices Act,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
“As you know, I originally introduced this bill in March 2020, and it was finally signed into law on December 29, 2022, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. This law requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standards for executive agencies to remove TikTok and any successor application from government devices within 60 days. Unfortunately, I have yet to see any signs of progress from your agency in developing these standards.”
He continued,
“It is therefore imperative that the executive branch implement this new legislation. Quite frankly, the executive branch should have done this long ago, without the need for congressional action. I therefore urge you to expedite your agency’s guidance and ensure total compliance within the statutory timeframe.”
Senator Hawley also included a series of questions for Director Young on implementation and compliance of the ban on government devices, and requested responses by Feb. 5, 2023.

January 27, 2023
The Honorable Shalanda Young
Director
Office of Management and Budget
725 17th St., NW
Washington DC 20503
Dear Director Young,
I write to urge the Biden Administration to expeditiously implement the recently enacted No TikTok on Government Devices Act. As you know, I originally introduced this bill in March 2020, and it was finally signed into law on December 29, 2022, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. This law requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standards for executive agencies to remove TikTok and any successor application from government devices within 60 days. Unfortunately, I have yet to see any signs of progress from your agency in developing these standards.
Government devices often carry sensitive or classified information related to national security. It is imperative that our information technology systems do not include Chinese malware or applications, such as TikTok. Removing TikTok from government devices is a critical first step to improving U.S. cybersecurity.
TikTok remains a serious threat to national security. For instance, the Chief Operating Officer of ByteDance (TikTok’s parent company) testified in September 2022 that its China-based employees could access U.S. user data. Similarly, on October 20, 2022, Forbes reported that a China-based ByteDance team planned to use the TikTok app to monitor American citizens’ personal locations. Reuters also reported on December 22, 2022, that TikTok employees accessed user data from two American journalists. TikTok is a clear and present danger to U.S. national security.
Senior officials in the Biden Administration agree. Secretary Yellen has acknowledged the “legitimate national security concerns” posed by TikTok. FBI Director Wray has stated that he is “extremely concerned” about China’s influence on U.S. users through TikTok.
It is therefore imperative that the executive branch implement this new legislation. Quite frankly, the executive branch should have done this long ago, without the need for congressional action. I therefore urge you to expedite your agency’s guidance and ensure total compliance within the statutory timeframe.
To promote transparency and to increase the effectiveness of this new law, please provide the following information by February 5, 2023:
Please produce any guidance OMB has circulated pursuant to the No TikTok on Government Devices Act.
Please provide, in a classified setting if necessary, an update on any intelligence, recommendations, or concerns provided to OMB by the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or the Secretary of Defense that will inform the promulgation of the development of standards and guidelines required by the No TikTok on Government Devices Act. Please confirm how OMB has incorporated or addressed such items in any circulated guidance.
Please provide a detailed description of how OMB is measuring government agencies’ compliance with this law.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Leads Missouri Delegation Letter Demanding Rollback of the Biden Admin’s New WOTUS Rule

sending a letter
to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Michael Connor, calling on the administration to immediately rescind its controversial new Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule.
“In this new regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purport to regulate every puddle and drainage ditch across America,”
the lawmakers wrote.
“This radical interpretation is inconsistent with the text and logic of the Clean Water Act.”
They continued,
“Farmers and ranchers in Missouri should be able to determine how to best manage their land and water, not the EPA. This rule is just another federal power grab that infringes on the property rights of farmers in our state. We demand that you rescind this rule immediately.”

Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works
U.S. Department of the Army

Washington, DC 20310
Dear Administrator Regan and Assistant Secretary Connor,
We write with deep concern over your agencies’ new “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule, which will prove ruinous to farmers in the State of Missouri. In this new regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purport to regulate every puddle and drainage ditch across America. This radical interpretation is inconsistent with the text and logic of the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule must be rescinded immediately.
In an attempt to justify this rule, Biden administration appointees have boldly claimed this rule would support agriculture. It does not. Farmers in our State have consistently cried foul at Democrats’ attempts to federalize their farmland. This new rule is little more than a redux of the Obama-era WOTUS rule that farmers detested—and which the Trump administration rescinded under the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Rather than support farmers and American businesses, this administration has caved to woke environmental activists that want to transform American agriculture.
We are particularly concerned about the EPA’s decision to regulate ephemeral streams, or “temporary streams,” and the use of the significant nexus standard to determine which waters can be regulated by the EPA. These provisions would subject the majority of farmland in the state to stringent EPA regulations concerning pesticide, fertilizer, and land usage. Alarmingly, failure to comply with these myriad regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties.
Farmers and ranchers in Missouri should be able to determine how to best manage their land and water, not the EPA. This rule is just another federal power grab that infringes on the property rights of farmers in our state. We demand that you rescind this rule immediately.
In the interim, please provide our offices with answers to the following questions:
What evidence and data justified your decision to classify ephemeral streams as “waters of the United States”? Please provide a full accounting.
Please identify which, if any, Missouri waters would not be designated “waters of the United States” under your agencies’ proposed rule.
Why was this rule promulgated prior to the issuance of a decision in the Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA, No. 21-454 (U.S.), a decision which will likely have significant consequences for the law governing “waters of the United States”?

Title: Hawley, Buck Introduce New Bill to Ban TikTok in U.S.
Date: Wednesday, January 25, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
to prohibit the Chinese-based TikTok app from being downloaded on U.S. devices and ban commercial activity with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.
“TikTok poses a threat to all Americans who have the app on their devices. It opens the door for the Chinese Communist Party to access Americans’ personal information, keystrokes, and location through aggressive data harvesting. Banning it on government devices was a step in the right direction, but now is the time to ban it nationwide to protect the American people,”
said Senator Hawley.
Representative Ken Buck (CO-4) is introducing House companion legislation.
“TikTok is a clear threat to our privacy and national security. Not only is TikTok directly associated with the Chinese Communist Party, but it has been used to spy on Americans and gain an alarming level of access to users’ phones. This should concern every citizen who values their privacy, security, and personal information. Banning CCP tied TikTok nationwide is the only route to ending this malicious cybersecurity threat,”
said
Representative Buck. “I am proud to introduce this legislation alongside Sen. Josh Hawley to ensure that every Americans’ privacy and security is protected from hostile foreign entities.”
View the bill text
here.
The
No TikTok on United States Devices Act
would:
Direct the President to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) within 30 days to block and prohibit transactions with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, with stiff penalties for entities that attempt to evade these sanctions.
Within 120 days of enactment, require the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report and brief Congress on the threats to national security posed by TikTok, including:
The ability of Chinese government to access U.S. user data.
The ability of the Chinese government to use U.S. user data for intelligence or military purposes, including surveillance, microtargeting, deepfakes, or blackmail.
Ongoing efforts by the Chinese government to monitor or manipulate Americans using data accessed via TikTok.
Senator Hawley’s
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
was
signed into law
last year.
He
originally introduced
the legislation in 2020 and it
unanimously passed the Senate later that year. In April 2021, Senator Hawley

Title: Hawley Announces ‘PELOSI Act,’ Reintroduction of Bill to Ban Lawmakers from Trading Stocks
Date: Tuesday, January 24, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) reintroduced his bill to ban lawmakers from stock trading. The
Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act
would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. The bill will require members found in violation to return their profits to American taxpayers.
“For too long, politicians in Washington have taken advantage of the economic system they write the rules for, turning profits for themselves at the expense of the American people. As members of Congress, both Senators and Representatives are tasked with providing oversight of the same companies they invest in, yet they continually buy and sell stocks, outperforming the market time and again,”
said Senator Hawley. “While Wall Street and Big Tech work hand-in-hand with elected officials to enrich each other, hardworking Americans pay the price. The solution is clear: we must immediately and permanently ban all members of Congress from trading stocks.”
View bill text
here.
Background
The
PELOSI Act
will:
Prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from holding, acquiring, or selling stocks or equivalent economic interests during their tenure in elected office. Any holdings in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds are exempt from the prohibition.
Give members of Congress and their spouses six months, upon assuming office, to divest any prohibited holdings or place those holdings in a blind trust for the remainder of their tenure in office.
Ensure members or their spouses forfeit any investment profits to the American people via the U.S. Treasury if they are found to be in violation of the Act. Members who violate the requirements will also lose the ability to deduct the losses of those investments on their income taxes. The ethics committees of Congress may levy additional fines and will publicize violations.
Require that after two years of the Act’s implementation, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will conduct an audit of members’ compliance with the Act.

originally introduced
the
Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act

Title: Hawley, Peters Request Assessment from GAO on Security Risks & Conflicts of Interest Posed by Consulting Firms Working with China
Date: Tuesday, January 24, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.)
sent a letter
to Government Accountability Office (GAO) Comptroller Gene Dodaro requesting an assessment of the potential national security risks associated with companies simultaneously contracting with the U.S. government and the Chinese government or Chinese state-run enterprises.
“Companies that carry out taxpayer-funded projects for the U.S. government should be working in the best interests of the American people, and we are concerned that companies that also contract with adversaries like the Chinese government could be creating unacceptable conflicts of interest,”
the Senators wrote.
Reporting has
revealed, as an example, that McKinsey & Company has received hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars to support sensitive national security projects. At the same time, McKinsey did not disclose to the Department of Defense (DoD) that they were simultaneously contracting with Chinese state-owned companies. This has raised serious concerns about the reliability of advice provided by McKinsey consultants, and whether its work could give a foreign adversary insight into our national security strategies or other sensitive matters.
Last Congress, Senator Hawley introduced the
Time to Choose Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms that hold a contract with the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party, or their proxies.
Read the new letter
here
or below.
January 24, 2023
The Honorable Gene Dodaro
Comptroller General
U.S. Government Accountability Office
441 G Street, NW
Washington, DC 20226
Dear Comptroller Dodaro,
We write to request the Government Accountability Office (GAO) perform an assessment of the national security risks posed by consulting firms who simultaneously contract with the U.S. federal government and the Chinese government or its proxies or affiliates. Companies that carry out taxpayer-funded projects for the U.S. government should be working in the best interests of the American people, and we are concerned that companies that also contract with adversaries like the Chinese government could be creating unacceptable conflicts of interest.
For example, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies have awarded contracts to consulting firms that have simultaneously provided services to the Chinese government and associated entities. In some instances, consulting firms have supported entities directly tied to the Chinese government, including by building artificial islands to position missiles, fighters and bombers in the South China Sea, and participating in exercises for an amphibious assault on Taiwan.  We are concerned that the provision of such services simultaneously could create conflicts of interest that threaten American national security and undermine U.S. foreign policy.
In addition to these potential conflicts of interest, these types of contracts could present other security risks that are not well understood. Although firms doing business for the Chinese government or its associates may argue that structural divisions between corporate entities servicing the Chinese and American governments, respectively, are sufficient to eliminate security risks or conflicts of interest posed by their work – we remain concerned that information sharing within these companies may result in Chinese entities accessing or taking advantage of firms’ access to U.S. government data, classified or otherwise. Several bills have been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee related to this problem, including:
S.4546, Time to Choose Act of 2022
S.3905, Preventing Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act
S. 4516, Combating Obstructive National Security Underreporting of Legitimate Threats (CONSULT) Act of 2022
To support further work of the committee on this issue, we request that GAO perform an assessment of the national security risks posed by consulting firms who contract with both the U.S. federal government and the Chinese government or its proxies or affiliates. In particular, we request the assessment include the following:
Assess the extent to which federal agencies collect information on contracts performed on behalf of the Chinese government or its proxies or affiliates by consulting firms that hold or have held contracts with the U.S. Government, and whether this information includes specific projects and deliverables of such contracts.
Evaluate the extent to which selected federal agencies, to include at a minimum the Department of Defense and elements of the Intelligence Community, have assessed the risks posed by American consulting firms’ work for the Chinese government and its proxies or affiliates, including an assessment of risk of deliberate or inadvertent sharing of U.S. government information that may be used for Chinese economic or military advantage.
Identify relevant contract clauses, procedures, and information used by federal agencies to identify, evaluate and resolve organizational conflicts of interest when awarding consulting contracts.
Assess the extent to which agencies experience challenges when identifying, evaluating and resolving organizational conflicts of interest. Including determining whether the offeror/potential contractor also performs work for China.
Identify steps federal agencies take to monitor contractor compliance with any contract clauses, terms or conditions intended to resolve identified conflicts of interest.
Thank you for your prompt attention.
Sincerely,

Title: Hawley, Bush Urge USACE to Test Entire Missouri School District for Contamination
Date: Wednesday, January 11, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Representative Cori Bush (MO-1)
sent a letter
to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon calling for additional radioactive testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties.
Senator Hawley previously
demanded
that USACE conduct radioactive testing at Jana Elementary School following reports of contamination, and
called on
President Biden to declare a federal emergency and make aid available for students and families.
“Concerned parents deserve certainty about the safety of their children’s learning environment and on that, USACE can and should help,”
they
wrote.
They continued, “USACE must prioritize the Hazelwood School District’s request for additional testing and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the school’s properties as soon as possible. The health and wellbeing of the students must be our top priority.”

Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon
55th Chief of Engineers and Commanding General
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
441 G Street NW
Washington, DC 20314-1000
Dear Lieutenant General Spellmon,
We write to urge the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to conduct additional radioactive contaminant testing of Hazelwood School District’s properties. USACE should begin testing as soon as possible and test all the district’s properties and buildings as requested by the Hazelwood School Board. Additionally, the district should be reimbursed for testing already conducted at their expense.
Following the closure of Jana Elementary School, students and parents have had their lives upended while waiting for answers and help from the federal government. The school district has actively reassigned students throughout the district, raising questions for some parents about the extent of any contamination. Concerned parents deserve certainty about the safety of their children’s learning environment and on that, USACE can and should help. USACE must prioritize the Hazelwood School District’s request for additional testing and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the school’s properties as soon as possible. The health and wellbeing of the students must be our top priority.
In addition, we request that USACE ensure transparency and independent verification throughout the testing process. It is crucial that the results of the testing be made available to the public and that any necessary remediation efforts be carried out with the utmost care, urgency, and expertise, all while keeping parents thoroughly informed.
We also request that USACE keep our offices informed of any developments in this matter and provide regular updates on the progress of the additional testing.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley                                   Cori Bush
United States Senator                     Member of Congress

Title: Hawley Slams DOJ’s Partisan Double Standards, Calls for Special Counsel in Biden Classified Docs Probe
Date: Wednesday, January 11, 2023

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland seeking further information about President Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents, and why the Department of Justice (DOJ) took the extreme step of raiding President Trump’s home in response to supposedly similar conduct but gave President Biden deferential treatment.
“In August of last year, FBI agents raided the Mar-a-Lago residence of former President Donald Trump, supposedly to secure classified documents dating back to President Trump’s time in office. President Biden appears to have done exactly what President Trump did—only he didn’t get his home raided by the FBI over it. The double standard here is astounding,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“To make matters worse, it’s taken until January of 2023 for this news to surface, even though the documents were found on November 2, 2022—just days before a hotly contested midterm election,”
he continued. “Clearly, the Biden Administration and its allies in the media did their best to bury the story.”
Senator Hawley concluded his letter with a list of follow-up questions for the Attorney General and called for an immediate response.
Read the full letter
here
or below:
January 11, 2023
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
On January 9, news broke that classified documents dating back to the Obama Administration had been located in President Biden’s former office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. These facts uncannily echo another recent scandal involving the Department. In August of last year, FBI agents raided the Mar-a-Lago residence of former President Donald Trump, supposedly to secure classified documents dating back to President Trump’s time in office. President Biden appears to have done exactly what President Trump did—only he didn’t get his home raided by the FBI over it.
The double standard here is astounding. The underlying behavior at issue—a President’s retention of old classified documents dating back to a past presidency—is materially the same in both cases. But in President Trump’s case, that retention triggered an unprecedented raid on the home of a former president, rationalized with a thicket of partisan doublespeak. President Biden has not experienced anything remotely similar.
To make matters worse, it’s taken until January of 2023 for this news to surface, even though the documents were found on November 2, 2022—just days before a hotly contested midterm election. Clearly, the Biden Administration and its allies in the media did their best to bury the story.
Your Department’s apparent disparate treatment of these two cases thus far isn’t especially surprising, because today’s FBI leadership is growing more partisan by the day. We know from an Inspector General report that the FBI fabricated evidence to justify spying on President Trump’s campaign in 2016. Now the FBI is once again up to the same tricks, putting its thumb on the scales to punish the Democratic Party’s political opponents. We shouldn’t forget, after all, that you also unleashed the FBI on parents who challenged critical race theory at school board meetings in the fall of 2021. Evidence of the Department’s internal rot is piling up everywhere.
During your confirmation hearings, you assured me—and the rest of the Judiciary Committee—that if confirmed, you would take the high road. In particular, you said in your responses to my questions for the record, “I have spent my whole professional life looking up to Ed Levi and the other post-Watergate Attorneys General who stood up on behalf of the Department against impermissible pressure and influence. If I am confirmed as Attorney General, I intend to do the same.” But on your watch, the Department’s conduct has clearly failed to live up to this standard.
Please respond to me immediately with full responses to the following questions:
Will you appoint a special counsel to investigate President Biden’s alleged retention of classified records, as you did for President Trump?
At what point were you notified that these documents existed?
Please provide a full explanation of the Department’s decision not to dispatch FBI agents to search the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement for classified documents dating back to the Obama Administration.
Did you personally direct Department personnel or FBI agents not to engage in a broader search of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement?
What communications did you have with personnel at the White House, the National Archives and Records Administration, President Biden’s campaign team, or members of the press regarding these classified documents?
Why was the fact that President Biden apparently improperly retained classified documents from a prior administration not divulged until long after the 2022 midterm elections?
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Announces New Army Funding for Fort Leonard Wood Housing
Date: Tuesday, December 20, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced that the
Army has committed
to spending $41.4 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and another $50 million in Fiscal Year 2024 for new housing at Fort Leonard Wood following Senator Hawley’s repeated demands over the past year that aging homes at the base be replaced.
In August 2022,
Senator Hawley toured the base, delivered remarks about the important work being done there, and visited with residents about base housing in need of replacement.
A few weeks before his August visit, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth requesting an update on the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
In May, he
pressed
Secretary Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
In June of 2021,
Senator Hawley asked the Secretary and General McConville
for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing on base. Following that exchange, the Army confirmed it had allocated funding for housing at Fort Leonard Wood. In early 2022, however, the Army informed the Senator’s office that funding was no longer available. Concerned by the Army’s reversal, Senator Hawley vowed to make sure the Army provides service members at Fort Leonard Wood with the quality housing they deserve.

Title: Hawley, Grassley Blast Biden Administration for Concealing Disinfo Board Documents, Demand Transparency
Date: Monday, December 19, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas blasting the Department’s decision to cover up the Disinformation Governance Board’s activities by redacting large swaths of records produced to Congress in response to the Senators’ oversight requests.
The Senators wrote, “Based on our review of this material, it appears that many of the redactions are applied to pre-decisional and deliberative process material. We remind you that the oversight letters we send to the Executive Branch are signed in our capacity as sitting members of Congress, a separate and co-equal branch of government. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provisions do not apply to the oversight requests we submit in our capacity as constitutional officers and should not be applied to the materials that DHS produces in response to congressional requests.”
“[…] Simply put, Congress controls when to make documents within its possession public, not DHS, and the people’s business ought to be public,”
they continued.
In June,
whistleblower documents
obtained by Senators Hawley and Chuck Grassley revealed a first-look at DHS’s internal plans for the Disinformation Governance Board, including a potential partnership with Twitter.
In November,
Senator Hawley revealed
new documents obtained from DHS as part of his investigation into President Joe Biden’s plans to establish a so-called “Disinformation Governance Board” to monitor and suppress the speech of American citizens. The hundreds of pages of heavily redacted internal emails, which can be read in full
here, expose that DHS’s plans for the Disinformation Governance Board were much more extensive than the Biden administration has publicly acknowledged.

December 15, 2022
VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
In our letter to you on June 7, 2022, we raised serious concerns about the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) growing counter-disinformation efforts and requested information necessary to inform our congressional oversight of DHS activities. Since that time, DHS has produced to our offices the attached three page response, dated June 29, 2022, which did not answer any of the ten questions we asked in our oversight letter, and the attached three document productions. The first of those productions included two documents already in the public domain, and the other two productions contained just over 500 pages of material, approximately half of which are mostly or entirely redacted.
Based on our review of this material, it appears that many of the redactions are applied to pre-decisional and deliberative process material. We remind you that the oversight letters we send to the Executive Branch are signed in our capacity as sitting members of Congress, a separate and co-equal branch of government. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provisions do not apply to the oversight requests we submit in our capacity as constitutional officers and should not be applied to the materials that DHS produces in response to congressional requests.
Shockingly, in its letter of June 29, 2022, DHS expressed concern that Congress made public documents provided to our offices by a whistleblower without consulting DHS. In this case, DHS again illustrated its erroneous belief that it has the authority to limit the release of material it marks with Executive Branch designations such as “For Official Use Only,” “Predecisional” and “Deliberative” and override our entirely separate constitutional authority to authorize and publicly release material that we obtain through oversight requests and lawful whistleblower disclosures. As our letter of June 7, 2022 made clear, we did not release all of the material provided to our offices, and we applied limited redactions to the material that we released. We make such decisions independently, based on our assessment of what will be in the best interest of transparency and the public interest. Moreover, DHS should learn a lesson in transparency and accountability when patriotic whistleblowers provide full and complete records in contrast to DHS failing to follow that standard and instead providing improperly redacted records.
Simply put, Congress controls when to make documents within its possession public, not DHS, and the people’s business ought to be public.
Further, documents we have received and recent public reports reinforce our alarm at DHS’s growing counter-disinformation activities. These efforts stretch well beyond DHS’s seriously misguided effort to establish a Disinformation Governance Board (DGB). A CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee document recently released by The Intercept states that “CISA has a burgeoning MDM [mis-, dis-, and mal-information] effort” that includes “directly engaging with social media companies to flag MDM…” The same article also quotes from a draft copy of DHS’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review which reportedly states that “in the coming years, the department plans to target ‘inaccurate information’ on a wide range of topics, including ‘the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.’” This report appears consistent with a memorandum we publicly released in an attachment to our June 7, 2022, letter to you, which emphasized such issues as “[d]isinformation related to the origins and effects of COVID-19 vaccines or the efficacy of masks” in the context of a broader discussion of DHS’s counter-disinformation efforts.
The records that DHS recently produced to our offices also show that a March 25, 2022, steering group meeting invitation from then-DGB Executive Director Nina Jankowicz went to a long list of DHS officials who, according to publicly available information, are affiliated with a range of different DHS offices and components. Due to DHS’s refusal to answer our legitimate oversight questions, the heavy redactions applied to the records DHS has produced to our offices so far, and an overall extreme lack of transparency by DHS around this issue, it is impossible to know the full extent to which various DHS components and offices are engaged in DHS’s “burgeoning” counter-disinformation efforts.
Accordingly, in order for Congress to conduct oversight of these matters, we ask that you respond to the following no later than December 29, 2022.
Please provide full and complete responses to all questions contained in our June 7, 2022, letter including un-redacted copies of all documents DHS has already provided to our offices in response to the letter.
Please provide a detailed description of DHS’s policy for responding to congressional oversight requests, including all guidelines used to determine when material should be redacted when producing materials to members of Congress.

Title: Hawley Delivers Remarks on Senate Passage of His Bill to Ban TikTok on Government Devices
Date: Thursday, December 15, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate Floor following the Senate’s
passage of his legislation
to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government devices.
“Last night, the Senate took the important step of unanimously on a bipartisan basis passing legislation to ban TikTok on all government devices. […] Never has the security threat to the American people from the Chinese Communist Party been more grave, and never has the determination on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to leverage every possible asset, every possible platform to gather information, personal information from the American people, been more serious than it is now. That is why last night’s action by this body is so critical,”
said Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley
originally introduced
the legislation last Congress and it
unanimously passed the Senate
in August 2020. In April 2021, Senators Hawley, Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cotton (R-Ark.)
reintroduced the legislation
and it
unanimously passed
in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Hawley has held hearings on the
security concerns around TikTok since 2019, and
questioned company representatives
as recently as September 14, 2022.

Title: Hawley Blasts Biden Admin. for Lack of Preparation Ahead of Title 42 Expiration
Date: Wednesday, December 14, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy, Blas Nuñez-Neto, demanding answers on the agency’s failure to prepare for the surge in illegal immigration across our southern border prior to Title 42 coming to an end. Officials are now bracing for
14,000 migrant
encounters per day.
In May, during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Hearing, Acting Assistant Secretary Nuñez-Neto predicted during
his testimony
that if Title 42 were to end, the United States would see a decrease in illegal immigrants at the southern border.
“Now, as this authority is set to expire, your prediction has proven wrong. […] A new report states that your department projects seeing 9,000 to 14,000 illegal immigrant encounters per day after Title 42 authority expires. […] The outcome of removing this authority was obvious, which is why I have advocated for Title 42 to remain in place,”
wrote Senator Hawley.

December 14, 2022
The Hon. Blas Nuñez-Neto
Acting Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Acting Assistant Secretary Nuñez-Neto,
I write with concern over recent reports warning of the coming surge in illegal immigration as Title 42 is set to expire. Officials are now bracing for 14,000 migrant encounters per day. Just this weekend, new footage emerged showing a caravan of more than 1,000 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border into El Paso, Texas. This is in addition to the over 16,000 illegal immigrant encounters and over $97 million in narcotics seized last weekend. Unsurprisingly, this uptick in activity at the border comes in anticipation of the Title 42 order’s expiration on December 21, 2022. But it appears your department has not taken any meaningful steps to prepare for the coming surge in illegal immigration.
As you may recall, last May, you appeared before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) to testify on the crisis at the southern border. In that hearing, I asked you about the potential effect of rescinding the Title 42 order, which authorizes the executive branch to turn away illegal aliens to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. To my amazement, you testified that if the Title 42 order was rescinded, “you are going to see a decrease [in encounters].” This was contrary to every expert prediction and basic common sense.
Now, as this authority is set to expire, your prediction has proven wrong. Migrants are lining up in droves at the southern border in anticipation of Title 42’s expiration. A new report states that your department projects seeing 9,000 to 14,000 illegal immigrant encounters per day after Title 42 authority expires. It also states that this is more than double the current number of daily crossings.
Sadly, this is not surprising. The outcome of removing this authority was obvious, which is why I have advocated for Title 42 to remain in place. For example, on April 6, 2022, I promptly sent a letter to Secretary Mayorkas warning of the ramifications of removing Title 42 authority. Yet your department does not appear to have taken any meaningful steps to secure the border in the face of these caravans. This is inexcusable and an abdication of your legal responsibilities.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by December 21, 2022:
Do you still believe that removing Title 42 authority will decrease the number of illegal migrant encounters at the southern border?
What policy positions have you developed to respond to a surge in encounters at the southern border following the expiration of Title 42?
What additional security forces and resources are you providing to the El Paso and Ciudad Juárez region, given the recent surge in illegal migrants?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Bill to Ban TikTok on Government Devices Passes Senate Unanimously
Date: Wednesday, December 14, 2022

Content:
Tonight U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bill to ban TikTok on government devices unanimously passed the Senate for the second time. Senator Hawley’s bill would follow up on steps already taken by the State Department, the
Department of Homeland Security, the
Department of Defense, and
TSA
to ban the app on federal government devices due to security concerns.
“TikTok is a Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party. It’s a major security risk to the United States, and until it is forced to sever ties with China completely, it has no place on government devices,”
said Senator Hawley. “States across the U.S. are banning TikTok on government devices. It’s time for Joe Biden and the Democrats to help do the same.”
Senator Hawley
originally introduced
the legislation last Congress and it
unanimously passed the Senate
in August 2020. In April 2021, Senators Hawley, Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cotton (R-Ark.)
reintroduced the legislation
and it
unanimously passed
in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Hawley has held hearings on the
security concerns around TikTok since 2019, and
questioned company representatives
as recently as September 14, 2022.

Title: Hawley Files Gonzalez v. Google Amicus Brief with Supreme Court, Challenging Big Tech’s Section 230 Immunity
Date: Wednesday, December 07, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) filed an
amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court
this week in the case
Gonzalez
v.
Google, dealing with online platforms and the Section 230 immunity they receive for their algorithmic recommendations.
In his brief, Senator Hawley argues that courts have consistently misread the text of Section 230: Congress never intended the law to shield companies’ knowing distribution of unlawful content. In this case, Google promoted videos from ISIS-aligned terrorists overseas via YouTube – materials that the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a U.S. student studying in France, says
led to their daughter’s murder. Senator Hawley’s brief argues that Google should face liability for its content recommendations.
“Google knows it has illegal content on its platforms, but they constantly point to Section 230 as their get-out-of-jail-free card. Enough,”
said Senator Hawley, in response to filing his brief. “In no way should Big Tech have this kind of immunity from the harm being inflicted by their platforms. With this case, the Supreme Court has a critical opportunity to restore the law’s original meaning and correct years of bad precedent. The Court should hold tech companies accountable for pushing illegal material to their users.”
Sen. Hawley has been a longtime leader in arguing that platforms should be held liable for their content-recommendation decisions. That’s why he introduced the
Federal Big Tech Tort Act
last year, which would impose liability on tech platforms for the harms their products inflict on children, in response to research findings that Meta knew Instagram was harmful to children and did nothing about it.

Title: New Hawley Op-Ed on Biden’s Bad Deal for Railworkers
Date: Tuesday, December 06, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Dec. 6, 2022 |
Compact Magazine
The Book of Deuteronomy instructs, “You shall not oppress a hired worker.” Apparently, no one told President Biden or the rest of the political-industrial complex. Last week, they united to stifle a potential strike by railway workers, the first one in years. It’s too costly for the economy, the DC types moaned, the workers are being unreasonable.
Hardly. The rail workers were merely asking for a handful of sick days, something the professional class regards as a matter of divine right. Half the House of Representatives still won’t show up for work for fear of even potentially falling ill. But railroad workers must be forced to work and take sick days on their own dime. The hypocrisy is rank—but also revealing. The country’s political class has very little regard for blue-collar work or the people who perform it. That needs to change.
[…]
For those who stand at the pinnacle of our society and our economy, America’s blue-collar workforce has become increasingly invisible.
As it turns out, the rail workers had good reason to threaten a strike. Right now in the United States, rail workers aren’t guaranteed paid sick days. They must use vacation time for any illness, and here’s the best part: They must request that vacation time in advance. Of course, as anyone who has been sick knows, it’s nearly impossible to forecast an illness before it happens. That’s how the current standoff started: Railway workers wanted sufficient paid leave to cover illnesses, and the big companies didn’t want to provide them, despite the fact the rail companies are more profitable than ever. How have they gotten so profitable in just the last few years? By cutting the number of rail jobs and working laborers harder.
[…]
No member of Congress or White House bureaucrat would ever have accepted this bad bargain, to say nothing of the Fortune 500, where white-collar employees just spent the last two years working “remote.” Many of them are still at it. And yet somehow, Biden and lawmakers decided even a few sick days for railway workers was a bridge too far.
Which raises the question: Do we want blue-collar work in this country or not?
[…]
Standing up for workers is a profoundly conservative cause. If conservatives care about protecting families, they should fight to see blue-collar workers paid enough to support a family on a single income. They should fight to see that those same workers are financially backstopped when they get sick or hurt.
If conservatives care about stopping “woke capital,” they should support American workers at the bargaining table, not undermine them at the first opportunity. There is a reason the woke capitalists eagerly ship jobs to China and elsewhere overseas. They don’t want to have to deal with American workers: They don’t want to pay them American wages or give them any say over the direction of American companies. But that should be exactly what conservatives want. The only way to solve the problem of corporate wokeness long-term is to make the liberal C-Suite accountable to God-fearing, patriotic American workers.
[…]
“You shall give [the worker] his wages,” Deuteronomy warns, “lest he cry against you to the Lord, and you be guilty of sin.” Sin. There’s an old-fashioned word. For conservatives, it ought to be a reminder that winning a better deal for America’s workers isn’t just an electoral imperative. It’s a moral one. The question now is whether we will take that duty seriously.

Title: Hawley Urges Blinken to Prioritize Arms for Taiwan Over Ukraine
Date: Tuesday, December 06, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
urging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to prioritize arming Taiwan over delivering weapons to Ukraine.
“Taiwan is more important for U.S. national interests than Ukraine,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “Seizing Taiwan is Beijing’s next step toward dominating the Indo-Pacific region. If Beijing succeeds, it would have dire ramifications for Americans’ national security, as well as our economic security and freedom of action.”
He continued, “Regardless of the weapons’ source, if both Taiwan and Ukraine need them, they should go to Taiwan first […] Nor does the United States have the luxury of waiting for China to invade Taiwan before we send weapons to the island. It will be exceedingly difficult to deliver weapons to Taiwan after a contingency begins due to Taiwan’s susceptibility to Chinese blockade. Moreover, the whole purpose of sending weapons now is to deter any conflict. Waiting jeopardizes this goal.”
A recent
Wall Street Journal
report found that U.S. arms transfers to Ukraine have exacerbated a growing backlog in weapons sales to Taiwan. That backlog includes weapons ideal for an asymmetric defense of Taiwan, including Javelin antitank weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
Read the entire letter
here
or below.
December 6, 2022
The Honorable Antony Blinken
Secretary of State
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20520
Dear Secretary Blinken,
I write with concern about reports that U.S. arms transfers to Ukraine are impeding our ability to prevent a war in Asia by supplying Taiwan with the weapons it needs to deter a Chinese invasion.
We should be clear: Taiwan is more important for U.S. national interests than Ukraine. Seizing Taiwan is Beijing’s next step toward dominating the Indo-Pacific region. If Beijing succeeds, it would have dire ramifications for Americans’ national security, as well as our economic security and freedom of action. We must not let this happen. Averting the real and growing threat from China requires us to expedite delivery to Taiwan of the weapons it needs to defend itself—provided Taiwan commits to an asymmetric defense, significantly increases its own defense spending, and pursues necessary defense reforms.
Your Administration, however, is doing the reverse. You are prioritizing arms to Ukraine over our vital security interests in Asia. This is not a tenable position. Last month, you personally acknowledged, “There has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years,” and that Beijing is now “determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline.” This is consistent with Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines’s assessment that China poses an “acute” threat to Taiwan between now and 2030. It also aligns with warnings from defense officials, including former commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Phil Davidson, who testified that Beijing may invade Taiwan as soon as 2027.
Despite the increasingly urgent threat, however, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission recently found that “[t]he diversion of existing stocks of weapons and munitions to Ukraine and pandemic-related supply chain issues has exacerbated a sizeable backlog in the delivery of weapons already approved for sale to Taiwan, undermining the island’s readiness.”
A Wall Street Journal report echoed the Commission’s findings. The report states, “The flow of weapons to Ukraine is now running up against the longer-term demands of a U.S. strategy to arm Taiwan to help it defend itself against a possible invasion by China.” It goes on to say that the backlog for Taiwan “has grown to $18.7 billion,” up from “more than $14 billion” a year ago. The backlog reportedly includes Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. These weapons are vital to an asymmetric defense of Taiwan, but they have yet to arrive in Taiwan, even as the Administration has sent thousands to Ukraine.
Administration officials will no doubt point out that the mechanisms for delivering weapons to Ukraine and Taiwan differ. Many weapons headed to Ukraine, for instance, come from existing U.S. stocks. But this explanation does little to allay concerns. Regardless of the weapons’ source, if both Taiwan and Ukraine need them, they should go to Taiwan first.
Nor does the United States have the luxury of waiting for China to invade Taiwan before we send weapons to the island. It will be exceedingly difficult to deliver weapons to Taiwan after a contingency begins due to Taiwan’s susceptibility to Chinese blockade. Moreover, the whole purpose of sending weapons now is to deter any conflict. Waiting jeopardizes this goal.
None of this is to say we should sell or otherwise provide weapons to Taiwan absent conditions. To the contrary, all U.S. arms transfers to Taiwan should be strictly conditioned to ensure they are used as effectively as possible in support of an asymmetric defense strategy. Among other things, that means tying U.S. transfers to Taiwanese defense spending increases and defense reforms. It also means providing Taiwan the right capabilities. Fighter jets, tanks, and the like will do little to deter or defeat an invasion. In contrast, Javelins, Stingers, HIMARS rocket launchers, and related weapons are ideal for an asymmetric defense strategy and should be sent to Taiwan as quickly as possible—not diverted to or delayed on account of Ukraine.
These concerns in mind, I request your written responses to the following questions no later than December 16, 2022:
Is it true that both Ukraine and Taiwan would benefit from some of the same capabilities to defend themselves? If so, please provide a list of such capabilities.
Is it true the United States has sent weapons to Ukraine that could also be used for an asymmetric defense of Taiwan? If so, please provide a list of such weapons, along with an explanation for why the Administration prioritized Ukraine over Taiwan in these cases.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in April 2022 that arming Taiwan would help to reduce operational risk to U.S. forces. How do you explain why it is worth arming Ukraine over Taiwan if that could leave U.S. forces in greater danger in the event of a Taiwan contingency?
The Chairman also testified that arming Taiwan would help to bolster deterrence against China. Does sending weapons to Ukraine that could also be used for an asymmetric defense of Taiwan weaken deterrence against China?
Going forward, will the Administration commit to prioritizing delivering weapons to Taiwan ahead of Ukraine and other countries? If so, how will you ensure this is done rapidly and effectively, at scale? If the Administration feels it is unable to deliver weapons to Taiwan ahead of other countries for legal reasons, please explain why.
How can Germany or other NATO allies do more to arm Ukraine, so the United States can focus more of its scarce resources on arming Taiwan?
Thank you for your attention to this important and increasingly urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Gallagher Introduce New Bill Prohibiting Tax-Exempt Entities from Investing in Chinese Companies
Date: Thursday, December 01, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.) introduced the
Dump Investments in Troublesome Communist Holdings Act (DITCH Act). The new legislation requires university endowments, public pension plans, and other entities exempt from federal income tax to divest their investments in Chinese companies or lose their tax-exempt status.
Senator Hawley said, “Universities, foundations, and other entities are exempt from federal income tax for their work promoting the public good in the United States. Investing in China does the opposite: it advances the economic ambitions and military modernization efforts of the Chinese Communist Party while selling out American workers and values. These tax-exempt entities must stop investing in China or lose their tax-exempt status.”
“Tax-exempt entities that invest in CCP-directed companies are not only profiting off of genocide, destroying the environment, and financing the PLA’s ability to build weapons that can kill Americans, but are also making U.S. taxpayers unwittingly subsidize it. This has to stop,”
said Congressman Gallagher.
“Any entity that receives preferential tax treatment must make a choice: are they committed to their professed values, or are they committed to financing a genocidal communist regime and its malign efforts around the world? If a tax-exempt entity chooses to continue to sell out its own country for a small slice of the Chinese market, then they must lose their tax-exempt status.”
To combat threats posed by investments in China, the
DITCH Act
would:
Prohibit entities exempt from federal income tax from investing in Chinese companies. Tax-exempt entities that do not divest investments would lose their tax-exempt status.
Allow the Treasury Secretary to grant a waiver to certain tax-exempt entities if they detail why their need for holding Chinese assets outweighs the national security risk.
Require the Treasury Secretary to publish a report within 360 days and then annually thereafter detailing outbound investment into the Chinese market.

Title: Hawley Statement on Biden, Dems Overruling Workers in Rail Negotiations
Date: Thursday, December 01, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on President Biden and Democrats overruling workers in rail negotiations:
“Today the Senate had the chance to stand up for railroad workers who frequently risk their lives and health on the job, just trying to support their families. Instead, the Senate sided with Joe Biden. Workers were asking for a handful of sick days per year. Biden and the Senate said no. I’d like to know how many of the White House staff, and how many members of Congress and their staff, are still ‘working remotely,’ all while they deny railroad workers more than one day of sick leave a year. The House of Representatives, for heaven’s sake, is still proxy voting—with many members not showing up to work at all—because of the Covid ‘health risk.’ But railroad workers can’t have more than one day of sick leave. And it wasn’t as if workers were asking Congress to intervene on their behalf. No, this was the White House and management and union bosses teaming up to use federal law to force workers to accept contracts they rejected in negotiations. And then people in DC wonder why working Americans think the system is rigged.
“Today was also a chance for Republicans to stand up for working people and against the DC establishment. They missed it. But make no mistake, the people who put on overalls or pick up a shovel or stand on the assembly line every day are worth fighting for. And the Republican Party will have no future without them.” – Senator Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Investigation: DHS Documents Expose Shocking New Details on Disinfo Board Censorship Agenda
Date: Wednesday, November 30, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
revealed new documents
obtained from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of his investigation into President Joe Biden’s plans to establish a so-called “Disinformation Governance Board” to monitor and suppress the speech of American citizens. The hundreds of pages of heavily redacted internal emails, which can be read in full below, expose that DHS’s plans for the Disinformation Governance Board were much more extensive than the Biden administration has publicly acknowledged.
In June,
whistleblower documents
obtained by Senators Hawley and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) revealed a first-look at DHS’s internal plans for the Disinformation Governance Board, including a potential partnership with Twitter and a public-facing “Rumor Control Program.”
New documents now show that, despite DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s testimony in May that the Board hadn’t met, the Disinformation Governance Board Steering Group had begun meeting on a weekly basis as early as February 2022 and already had operational authorities.
The new documents also reveal that the Disinformation Governance Board plans to partner with Big Tech were far more extensive than DHS or the White House has admitted. Internal emails detail how DHS officials planned to meet with Meta’s Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher in February 2022,
the same official who was in charge of security
during Facebook’s suppression of the
New York Post
’s reporting on Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 election. The Disinformation Governance Board also planned to establish an “analytic exchange” with “industry partners” in Big Tech.
Finally, the documents expose how the Disinformation Governance Board coordinated with the Omidyar Network, a left-wing dark money organization
that has funneled millions of dollars into liberal advocacy groups.
Emails show the Board received a document known as the “Z Memo” from the Omidyar Network in March. One week later, Jankowicz shared an op-ed authored by Omidyar staff with her colleagues.
In a
new letter to Secretary Mayorkas, Senator Hawley blasts the administration over their lack of transparency and demands DHS immediately provide Congress with full, unredacted copies of all documents produced.

The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
I write concerning new documents relating to Nina Jankowicz and the Disinformation Governance Board. As you know, on June 7, 2022, Senator Grassley and I expressed alarm over your decision to establish an unconstitutional Disinformation Board within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In that letter, we published documents obtained through a whistleblower that outlined the pervasive scope and ambitions of the Disinformation Board. It is clear based on the latest documents you have finally turned over that the Department still has not told the truth about its continuing efforts to censor political speech.
On May 4, 2022, in response to my questioning, you testified, “The board has not yet met.” That was untrue. Documents that your own Department recently produced to my office show that the Disinformation Governance Board’s Steering Group met as early as February 4, 2022, and was meeting on a weekly basis. Shortly after Ms. Jankowicz onboarded, she requested “a copy of the last 2-3 steering group meeting agendas.” Despite your assertions to the contrary, the board appeared to have operational authorities: Ms. Jankowicz indicated it was the responsibility of Disinformation Board members to “ensure that their respective components implement, execute, and follow Board decisions.”
Our whistleblower documents previously revealed that the Board was engaging with Twitter on possible censorship activities. These new records show even more Big Tech companies were involved. The Disinformation Board planned to meet with Nathaniel Gleicher of Meta (formerly Facebook), who was head of security policy at that company during the controversy over the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story, and had contacts with the Omidyar Network, a liberal dark money group which has poured millions into combatting “misinformation”.
The documents further show that the Disinformation Board’s Executive Director, Nina Jankowicz, repeatedly pushed for DHS to establish an “analytic exchange” with “industry partners”—possibly a portal for Big Tech companies to coordinate speech suppression with the government. She also pressed for so-called disinformation experts to meet with the Board, including one who wrote that “[c]onservative consumers are more likely to be susceptible to fake news and misinformation”
and “most fake news is conservative-leaning.” Another expert she identified has posted about “Why Poor Whites Chant Trump” and argued that “Anti-immigrant disinformation is strongly associated with the ideology of exclusion and native supremacy that underpin [sic] right-wing popularism and far-right extremism.” We now also know that when you finally abolished the Disinformation Board, the Board’s deputy, Elizabeth Kozey, was hired into the White House, where she works in the National Security Council’s Resilience & Response Directorate.
A federal court recently concluded that an official in your department is “supervising the ‘nerve center’ of federally directed censorship.” In light of that, I would have hoped you would be more forthcoming. Instead, you have continued your blatant attempt to avoid transparency and sidestep congressional oversight. The documents you turned over to my office, six months after I requested them, are so heavily redacted most are illegible.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide unredacted copies of all documents produced to Congress as well as all records responsive to my oversight requests dated April 28, May 23, July 7, July 13, September 21, and November 14.
As part of my investigation into the Disinformation Board, I will be releasing for the public all documents in my possession so Americans can judge for themselves your agency’s efforts to censor speech.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Apple Condemn CCP COVID Crackdown, Reduce Reliance on Foreign Labor
Date: Tuesday, November 29, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Apple’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook urging him to reduce Apple’s dependency on foreign labor in China and reshore production to the United States. Senator Hawley also called on Apple to explain
why they limited
the iPhone AirDrop feature in China, widely used by anti-CCP protestors, and respond to reports that they have threatened to
remove Twitter
from the App Store.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
November 29, 2022
Mr. Tim Cook
Chief Executive Officer
Apple Inc.
1 Apple Park Way
Cupertino, CA 95014
Dear Mr. Cook,
I write regarding Apple’s ongoing collaboration with the totalitarian Chinese government. Your continued dependency on Chinese labor not only undermines the interests of the American economy and its workers, but has once again led your company to crack down on speech at the Chinese Communist Party’s behest. Apple’s activities in China are unconscionable and present substantial material risks to your stakeholders. I urge you to take meaningful steps to end operations in China and to reshore production to the United States.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Chinese Communist Party has subjected the Chinese people to draconian public health measures. During the past week, dissatisfaction with the nation’s so-called zero-COVID policy came to a head: from Beijing to Shanghai and Urumqi, citizens took to the streets to protest and voice their dissent. This included demonstrations at a Foxconn factory in the city of Zhengzhou, one of the largest manufacturers of Apple’s iPhone. After enduring weeks of stringent pandemic mitigation measures, workers protested and clashed with Chinese law enforcement. Videos of these confrontations, including shocking images of workers being beaten and kicked by officials in hazmat suits, were widely circulated on social media and in the press.
Since Apple makes more than 95 percent of its iPhones in China, these disruptions pose substantial material risks to Apple’s stakeholders. To make matters worse, your company appears to be actively supporting the Chinese government’s brutal crackdown. For example, public reports indicate that Apple, through a recent software update for iPhones in China, has modified the AirDrop function to make it more difficult for protestors to use this function to evade censorship and surveillance. Unconscionable though this decision may be, it is not surprising: under your leadership, Apple has time and again assisted the Chinese Communist Party in surveilling and suppressing the basic human rights of the Chinese people. At the same time, it appears that Apple might be importing this model of speech control to the United States: reports indicate that your company might deplatform Twitter from the App Store as a consequence of the free speech policies implemented by new ownership.
You have been called the architect of Apple’s strategy to outsource production to China.6 While this strategy has yielded short-term profits for you and your shareholders, cracks are beginning to emerge in the aftermath of the pandemic and in the face of intensifying geopolitical tensions. It is time for Apple to chart a new path forward. I therefore urge you to take meaningful steps to reduce your dependence on Chinese labor, especially by reshoring production in the United States. So that Congress may consider remedial legislation, please respond to the following questions by December 6, 2022:
Apple has not condemned the treatment of workers who manufacture its products in China, including the physical violence inflicted upon them by Chinese law enforcement in Zhengzhou. When will Apple issue a statement condemning this treatment? And why has it not done so already?
Given the Chinese Communist Party’s commitment to a zero-COVID policy, please detail the material risks associated with Apple’s continued dependency on China for the manufacture of its products. How does Apple communicate these risks to its stakeholders?
If China were to invade Taiwan, what impact would this have on Apple’s ability to manufacture and sell its products? How does Apple communicate these risks to its stakeholders?
Please detail Apple’s plan to diversify its supply chain and production networks, including any plans to expand manufacturing of its products in the United States with American workers.
Why did Apple modify the AirDrop feature in China in a manner that makes it more difficult for Chinese protesters to communicate amongst themselves? Please provide all communication between Apple and Chinese Communist Party officials concerning the AirDrop feature in the iOS 16.1.1 update.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: The GOP is dead. A new GOP must listen to working people.
Date: Friday, November 18, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | Nov. 18, 2022 |
Washington Post
The old Republican Party is dead. It has been wasting away for years now, and this month’s midterm results are the finishing blow. If Republicans learn nothing else from this election, they must learn that much.
As frustrating as the election outcomes are, the death of the old GOP is no reason
to mourn. It just means that it’s time for Republicans to forge something new — a party that truly represents the cultural backbone of this nation: America’s working people.
[…]
For decades, Republican politicians have sung a familiar tune. On economics, they have cut taxes on the big corporations and talked about changing Social Security and Medicare — George W. Bush even tried to partially privatize Social Security back in 2005. In the name of “growth,” these same Republicans have supported ruinous trade policies — such as admitting China to the World Trade Organization — that have collapsed American industry and driven down American wages.
This tax-and-trade agenda has hollowed out too many American towns by shipping jobs overseas. It has made it almost impossible to raise a family on one income and to find a good-paying job that doesn’t require a college degree. Our trade deficit with China has cost this country 3.7 million good jobs, while a crisis of drug overdose deaths — particularly among working Americans — has ravaged many of the same communities that have suffered most from deindustrialization. It has all made it harder to stay rooted in your hometown or region. That’s not a record of
success.
[…]
Republicans will only secure the generational victories they crave when they come to terms with this reality: They must persuade a critical mass of working class voters that the GOP truly represents their interests and protects their culture. The red wave didn’t land in part because voters who cast a ballot for Barack Obama
and later supported Donald Trump — voters who likely disapprove of Joe Biden and the Democrats’ agenda — chose to stay home.
Republicans must win these voters. We will not be a majority without them. That means waking up to what they care about. Work, family and culture are the touchstones of meaning for working people across the country. They must form the bedrock of a new party agenda.
[…]
Right now, the Republican Party stands at a crossroads. Its leaders can, of course, attempt to resurrect the dead consensus of offshoring, amnesties and “free trade.” That’s the path to further losses.
A reborn Republican Party must look very different. It must offer good jobs and good lives, not just higher stock prices for Wall Street. And it must place working Americans at its heart and take them as they are, rather than treating them as resources to be exploited or engineered away.
That’s the way to victory. That’s the way to national renewal.

Title: Following FTX Collapse, Hawley Demands Correspondence Between Regulators, the DNC, and the Biden White House
Date: Friday, November 18, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam demanding information and all correspondence between their agencies and Democratic Party officials following
the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
Senator Hawley wrote, “The recent revelations about the cryptocurrency exchange platform, FTX, and its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research, are stunning. Public reporting has revealed that these businesses and their executives, most notably Sam Bankman-Fried, a top donor to the Democratic Party, defrauded customers of billions of dollars. The perpetrators of these criminal acts and their enablers must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and you must conduct a full conflict-of-interest review to ensure that Mr. Bankman-Fried’s status as a top donor to the Democratic Party did not insulate him from oversight and accountability.”
He continued, “To be clear, Mr. Bankman-Fried funded his lavish donations to the Democratic Party through rampant fraud.

Dear Attorney General Garland, Chairman Gensler, and Chairman Behnam,
The recent revelations about the cryptocurrency exchange platform, FTX, and its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research, are stunning. Public reporting has revealed that these businesses and their executives, most notably Sam Bankman-Fried, a top donor to the Democratic Party, defrauded customers of billions of dollars. The perpetrators of these criminal acts and their enablers must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and you must conduct a full conflict-of-interest review to ensure that Mr. Bankman-Fried’s status as a top donor to the Democratic Party did not insulate him from oversight and accountability.
Mr. Bankman-Fried founded Alameda in 2017 and FTX in 2019. FTX became the second largest cryptocurrency exchange, attracted investments from some of the nation’s top asset management firms, elicited adulation from prominent celebrities and media outlets, and was at one point valued at $32 billion. But public reporting has now revealed substantial reasons to believe that these companies were vehicles for fraud.
Mr. Bankman-Fried allegedly withdrew customer deposits from FTX to offset losses at Alameda, a violation of the exchange’s terms of service.  To paper over the fact that he had depleted FTX’s assets, Mr. Bankman-Fried filled FTX’s asset ledger with artificial assets of near-zero value and grossly misrepresented the value of those assets. The public revelation of this activity caused the value of assets associated with the exchange to plunge, created a liquidity crisis as customers raced to withdraw their deposits, and culminated with both FTX and Alameda filing for bankruptcy. Customers are now left holding the bag.
Mr. Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent acts erode trust in U.S. financial markets. But they also have had political ramifications. The success of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s criminal enterprise briefly made him one of America’s richest men. And he deployed his ill-gotten gains in service of the Democratic Party, emerging in recent years as its second largest individual donor behind only George Soros. During the 2020 elections, Mr. Bankman-Fried donated $10 million to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. During the 2022 midterm elections, he donated nearly $37 million to Democratic candidates and causes. And earlier this year, he indicated that he was willing to spend an unprecedented $1 billion in support of the Democratic Party in the 2024 elections.
To be clear, Mr. Bankman-Fried funded his lavish donations to the Democratic Party through rampant fraud. The net result was that billions of dollars were stolen from investors and handed over to Democrats and left-wing organizations. The fact that this scheme was revealed immediately after the midterm elections raises serious questions about whether federal regulators and law enforcement faced conflicts of interest in identifying, investigating, and thwarting the fraudulent scheme. So that Congress can better fulfill its oversight of executive action and inaction, I request answers to the following questions by November 25, 2022:
Prior to the public revelation of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s scheme to withdraw customer deposits from FTX to offset losses incurred by Alameda, had your respective agencies initiated an investigation into allegations of fraud perpetuated by FTX, Alameda, and their executives? If so, when were the investigations initiated and when were they expected to conclude?
Have FTX, Almeda, or any of the executives associated with these companies previously entered into confidential settlements or deferred prosecution agreements with your respective agencies? If so, please provide all materials associated with these settlements and agreements.
Please provide all correspondence between your agencies, the Biden Administration, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee regarding FTX, Alameda, and its executives, including Mr. Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, and Gary Wang.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Answers on DHS ‘Disinformation’ Efforts
Date: Monday, November 14, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, following a new report that the agency continues to collude with Big Tech to suppress Americans’ speech online. Secretary Mayorkas will testify this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday. Senator Hawley serves on both committees.
In his new letter,
Senator Hawley wrote, “It is clear from the latest reports that you have deliberately withheld documents from Congress and the American public about your efforts to suppress speech. Your actions are a blatant disregard for congressional oversight and a violation of statutory law.”
Following the dissolution of the Disinformation Governance Board earlier this year,
leaked documents
have revealed DHS continues to censor speech touching on the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine efficacy, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and the war in Ukraine.
Read the entire letter
here
and below:
November 14, 2022
The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
Under your tenure, you have transformed the Department of Homeland Security into an engine to suppress the freedom of speech. According to explosive reports, you are yet again hiding information about your efforts to suppress speech you dislike—in flagrant disregard of congressional oversight requests and federal law. This is unacceptable. You must immediately disclose, publicly, all your efforts to suppress speech.
When you last appeared before the Senate, I questioned you at length about your decision to create a so-called “Disinformation Governance Board” and appoint Nina Jankowicz to lead this anti-free speech committee. In August, you finally disbanded that dystopian project. But The Intercept reports that although “DHS shuttered its controversial Disinformation Governance Board, a strategic document reveals the underlying work is ongoing.” In other words, you professed to disband that board but in fact simply transferred its speech-suppression activities to other groups in your Department.
Leaked documents obtained by The Intercept “illustrate an expansive effort by the agency” to continue the speech-suppression mission of the Disinformation Governance Board after you supposedly disbanded that board. As the documents reveal, “initiatives are underway as DHS pivots to monitoring social media.” This activity is happening “[b]ehind closed doors” and “through pressure on private platforms,” such as Facebook. What is more, “Facebook created a special portal for DHS” to streamline directives from your Department to suppress speech. While you were publicly announcing that you had disbanded the Disinformation Governance Board, your Department was still “having biweekly meetings” behind closed doors with Facebook to suppress speech.
In light of these shocking revelations, it is no wonder that a federal judge has already given Missouri and Louisiana authority to compel testimony from top Biden Administration officials about the Administration’s unconstitutional speech suppression—including from Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, an agency within your Department.
When you last appeared before the Senate, you testified under oath in response to my questioning that you “owe openness and transparency” to the Senate and that, absent a legal prohibition, you would “produce the documents” related to your speech-suppression efforts. Yet despite my repeated requests for information in letters dated April 28, May 23, July 7, and July 13, you still have not come clean about the full extent of your Department’s operations. You have even flouted statutory law that requires you provide documents in response to my May 23 request. 5 U.S.C. § 2954.
It is clear from the latest reports that you have deliberately withheld documents from Congress and the American public about your efforts to suppress speech. Your actions are a blatant disregard for congressional oversight and a violation of statutory law. Before you appear for questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 16, please provide me with all communications and records related to your Department’s efforts to suppress speech, whether through the Disinformation Governance Board or under any other name.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Bill to Personally Sanction Xi Over Complicity in Uyghur Genocide
Date: Thursday, October 20, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will be introducing
new legislation
to personally sanction Chinese President Xi Jinping, along with his top lieutenants in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), over their complicity in the Uyghur genocide in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Senator Hawley said, “While Joe Biden is distracted, Xi Jinping is rapidly consolidating power within the Chinese Communist Party, power he intends to use to compel the world to turn a blind eye to the crimes of his regime. But we must not look away. We must hold Xi and his lieutenants accountable for their crimes against humanity and we can start by imposing real costs for their complicity in the atrocities in Xinjiang.”
Senator Hawley’s bill would impose Global Magnitsky Sanctions on President Xi and other CCP officials—freezing their assets and barring them from traveling to the U.S.—and direct the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to file regular reports identifying CCP officials complicit in the perpetration of genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.
Senator Hawley’s
Sanction Xi Jinping for Xinjiang Atrocities Act
does the following:
Affirms that General Secretary Xi Jinping is complicit in the genocide and other crimes against humanity perpetrated against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Calls for General Secretary Xi and other senior Chinese Communist Party officials to be held accountable for their roles in the genocide and other crimes against humanity perpetrated against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to file regular reports identifying senior Chinese Communist Party officials who directed, oversaw, monitored, or were otherwise complicit in the perpetration of genocide and other crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Directs imposition of Global Magnitsky Sanctions on senior Chinese Communist Party officials identified as having directed, overseen, monitored, or otherwise been complicit in the perpetration of genocide and other crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

Title: Hawley Urges Biden to Declare Federal Emergency Over Radioactive Contamination at Missouri School
Date: Wednesday, October 19, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a new letter
to President Biden today, calling for the president to declare a federal emergency following the impending closure of Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Mo. due to reports of radioactive contamination and to authorize immediate federal relief for all families affected by the crisis.
The Hazelwood Board of Education
made the decision
on Tuesday night to close Jana Elementary School, forcing students to make the switch to virtual learning until the health risk is resolved. In light of the news, Senator Hawley is requesting that President Biden invoke measures for an emergency declaration to deliver relief to students and expedite cleanup.
On Tuesday afternoon, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon demanding the Corps investigate reports of radioactive contamination at Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Mo.
In his new letter to President Biden,
Senator Hawley said
“The federal government bears ultimate responsibility for this situation, and it is your administration’s obligation to remedy it. The contamination at the school likely stems from federal activity in decades past.”
He continued, “The federal government should never subject children in this country to radioactive contamination in their schools. And parents and other residents of the area should not have to wait any longer for cleanup and relief.”
Read the full letter
here
or below:
October 19, 2022
The Honorable Joseph R. Biden Jr.
President of the United States
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President,
I write regarding the emergency situation at Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Missouri. I call on you to declare a federal emergency and immediately authorize federal relief.
As you may know, recent chemical testing at Jana Elementary has revealed potential radioactive contamination in and around the school. As a result, the local school board has closed the facility. Students now lack access to in-person instruction. And parents are left with deep uncertainty about their children’s education and health, as well as the financial burden of having children once again home from school.
The federal government bears ultimate responsibility for this situation, and it is your administration’s obligation to remedy it. The contamination at the school likely stems from federal activity in decades past. For that reason, the area immediately adjacent to the school is already under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. The parents, children, and residents of this area have waited years for the federal government to complete its cleanup. Now their school is contaminated. They deserve immediate relief. You should act without delay to declare a federal emergency and authorize federal assistance.
Federal relief should focus on ridding the school and surrounding area of any and all contamination, immediately, drawing on all appropriate federal resources and personnel. If an immediate cleanup of the school area is not feasible, the federal government should provide funds to rebuild the school at an appropriate site. In the interim, the federal government should ensure children can access in-person instruction at an alternate facility. The government should also provide immediate relief to parents who must now miss work to care for small children at home and pay for other related educational expenses.
The federal government should never subject children in this country to radioactive contamination in their schools. And parents and other residents of the area should not have to wait any longer for cleanup and relief. The Army Corps has been “cleaning up” the contamination site for at least two decades. Enough is enough. I ask you to act without delay.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands USACE Investigate Reports of Radioactive Contamination at Missouri School

Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon demanding the Corps investigate reports of radioactive contamination at Jana Elementary School in Florissant, Mo.
In his letter, Senator Hawley demanded the Corps review results of
a new private report, conduct further testing on school grounds, and take action to ensure the safety of students at Jana Elementary. Parents of students were not informed of these potential risks until
August 2022.
“Hazardous radioactive contamination has no place in schools, and the federal government should be transparent with concerned parents,”
said Senator Hawley. “I urge you and your team to review the results of the recent private testing immediately, and also immediately to conduct further appropriate testing of the Jana Elementary area— and make the results public.”

Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon
55th Chief of Engineers and Commanding General
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
441 G Street NW
Washington, DC 20314-1000
Dear Lieutenant General Spellmon,
I am deeply concerned by new reports of radioactive contamination near a Missouri elementary school in an area under management by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Many parents and teachers are concerned as well, to say the least, and they have every right to be. You must take action immediately to protect these vulnerable children and others in the area.
The results of recent testing at Jana Elementary in Florissant, Missouri, conducted by a private firm show levels of radiation well exceeding federal standards. It should go without saying that hazardous, radioactive contamination has no place in schools, or anywhere near schools, or anywhere near any place where children are. And it should also go without saying the federal government must be honest and transparent about the facts.  I urge you and your team to review the results of the recent private testing immediately, and also immediately to conduct further appropriate testing of the Jana Elementary area—and make the results public. You should also explain, without delay, what actions the Corps and other agencies are taking now to ensure the safety of school children at Jana Elementary and in the St. Louis region.
I emphasize that time is of the essence and delay is not acceptable. Residents of this community have had to deal with uncertainty and changing facts for too long.
Please respond to the following questions immediately:
What is the current federal safety standard applicable to Jana Elementary?
When will USACE independently verify the testing at Jana Elementary?
What is the approximate risk level posed to children and residents by the radiation levels in the Hazelwood School District?
What is USACE doing to mitigate the risks identified by the testing?
How has USACE communicated the testing, risks, and mitigation strategies to parents in Hazelwood School District?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Leads Colleagues in Effort to Remove NDAA Provision Forcing Women to Register for Draft
Date: Wednesday, October 12, 2022

Content:
Eight Senators have signed on to an
amendment
led by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would remove a provision requiring women to register for the Selective Service System.
U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.) cosponsored Senator Hawley’s amendment this week.
“Forcing our daughters, mothers, wives, and sisters to fight our wars is wrong. We should celebrate the women who have volunteered to serve our country and thank the women who played a vital role in defending America at every point in our nation’s history,”
Senator Hawley said. “But volunteering is different than being forced to serve, and that’s why it was removed from last year’s NDAA. I hope my colleagues join us again to ensure we don’t change our laws to require women in this country to register for the draft.”
Senator Cruz said, “As a proud father of two daughters, the prospect of the government forcing women into military service is outrageous. American women are capable of achieving anything they set their minds to, but they should not be compelled against their will to fight in our wars.”
Senator Cotton said, “Our military has welcomed women for decades and our nation is stronger for it. But America’s daughters should never be drafted against their will.”
Senator Rubio said, “Women are free to choose if they would like to serve honorably in our armed forces, but no wife, daughter, or mother should be forced to serve against her will. It is wrong and unnecessary.”
Senator Marshall said, “There is no doubt our nation has incredible women serving throughout our Armed Forces — many of which are accomplishing remarkable achievements in order to defend our freedoms and way of life,” said Senator Marshall. “That said, America should not be a country that forces its daughters, mothers, wives, and sisters to go to war. This proposal is wrong, and I will continue to oppose it.”
Senator Daines said, “Brave Montana men and women carry out the Treasure State’s rich legacy of service by voluntarily joining our nation’s military. There is no need to force our nation’s daughters to enter the draft.”
Senator Boozman said, “Women voluntarily joining our Armed Forces has undeniably strengthened the U.S. military’s effectiveness and resilience. Preserving their ability to willingly pursue service in uniform, while ensuring it remains an option rather than an obligation, continues to be a priority. I’m proud to join Sen. Hawley and our colleagues in leading the effort to protect this existing pathway.”
Last year, Senator Hawley
successfully led
the Republican effort to remove this provision from the FY ’22 NDAA.

to the United States Postal Service (USPS) Inspector General pushing for answers on reports of consistent mail service delays in the Kansas City Northland area.
For the last few months Senator Hawley’s office has heard from constituents in Kansas City’s Northland area on mail-related issues. Missourians experiencing similar problems can contact our office

“The need for reliable mail service across Missouri is critical. Recent news reports have documented how residents in these areas routinely wait more than five days between receiving any mail. When the mail does arrive, it comes in large quantities at once. Residents have contacted USPS regarding the ongoing issues and received little assurance of improvement,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued,
“While I am encouraged to hear that the USPS is working to address the poor service performance by reassigning staff and hiring additional staff, further action may be necessary.”
Senator Hawley requested that the Postal Service investigate the service complaints from Clay and Platte Counties in Missouri and conduct an audit of the offices of concern.

Dear Inspector General Hull,
It has been brought to my attention that residents in the Kansas City Northland area have been experiencing consistent mail service delays. To determine the cause of these delays and recommend corrective action, I urge you to conduct an audit of all post offices in Clay and Platte Counties.

Title: New Hawley Bill to Empower States to Deport Illegal Immigrants, Protect American Communities
Date: Tuesday, September 27, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the
Empowering States to Deport Illegal Immigrants Ac
t, new legislation that will give authority for states to enforce federal immigration laws and prosecute anyone who illegally enters the country that is residing in their state. With a rise in illegal drug trafficking and a surge in illegal border crossings over the past year, this bill will help protect American families and communities.
Due to the Biden Administration’s disastrous immigration policies, the United States is experiencing an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration. In 2022, there were more than
2 million border encounters, up nearly 470% since 2020. This does not account for illegal immigrants who entered our country without being encountered by Customs and Border Protection. Democrats fought hard to end President Trump’s Remain-in-Mexico policy, and doing so has contributed to a rise in crime, drug trafficking, and human trafficking across the southern border into the United States.
“The Biden Administration’s extreme open border policies have had a devastating effect on the people of Missouri and the entire country. States have had limited ability to fight back during this period of record-breaking illegal border crossings. My bill would finally give states the ability to enforce federal immigration law and deport illegal immigrants. If Joe Biden won’t secure the border, then it’s time to give states the power to do it,”
said Senator Hawley.
The
Empowering States to Deport Illegal Immigrants Act
would allow states to:
Remove illegal immigrants from the country, not just send them to other states
Stop the record-high wave of illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border, which not only affects border states, but the rest of the United States
Prosecute people who commit crimes while entering the country illegally

Title: Hawley Demands Answers From Garland Over Extraordinary Force Used by FBI to Arrest Pro-Life Activist
Date: Monday, September 26, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding answers on reports the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sent as many as 25 armed agents to arrest a pro-life activist following a local dispute outside of an abortion clinic. Senator Hawley also called on Garland to answer for repeatedly weaponizing the FBI and other arms of the federal government against political opponents.

September 26, 2022
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
If the shocking reports about the FBI arresting a man Friday in rural Pennsylvania are true, then you have a lot to answer for. These reports state that federal authorities obtained a warrant under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act to arrest Mark Houck for allegedly committing a single count of simple assault by pushing a man near an abortion clinic. Houck contends that he only did so to defend his child against the man, and local authorities have already dismissed a separate criminal complaint against Houck for the same conduct.
Not only did your office turn a local dispute into a national case, but the FBI reportedly executed the search warrant in as extreme a manner as one can imagine. Reports state that the FBI sent as many as 20 to 25 agents to conduct the arrest. And the FBI allegedly arrested Houck at gunpoint early in the morning in front of his seven children. The FBI admitted, in a statement, that as many as 20 agents were present with their guns drawn. As Houck’s wife said, when they saw 20 or more agents arrest their father at gunpoint, “the kids were all just screaming.” To say the least, using this kind of force to make an arrest for a single charge of simple assault is unprecedented.
The reports are especially shocking given that your office has so far turned a blind eye to the epidemic of violence across the country by pro-abortion extremists against pregnancy resource centers, houses of worship, and pro-life Americans—violent acts that are prohibited by the very same law under which you are charging Mark Houck.
One group reports 104 incidents of extremist violence against pregnancy resource centers, churches, and pro-life Americans since the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion on May 3.1 Those attacks include fire-bombings and arsons. Just last week, an 83-year-old woman was shot while engaging in pro-life activism.2 Despite my repeated requests, you still have not identified a single prosecution the Department of Justice has taken in response to this epidemic of violence against pro-life Americans.
All of this comes after more than a year of your office repeatedly weaponizing the FBI and other arms of the federal government against political opponents. If you are trying to inspire confidence in your department, you are failing magnificently.
I believe you must testify, under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee about your selective use and apparent political weaponization of the FACE Act.
In addition, within 10 days, please provide answers to the following questions:
Why were 20-25 armed FBI agents sent to Mark Houck’s home to execute an arrest for alleged simple assault?
Why did those agents have their guns drawn?
Since May 3, 2022, how many charges has your department brought against pro-abortion extremists who have attacked pregnancy resource centers, churches, and pro-life Americans?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Google on Apparent Efforts to Punish Pregnancy Resource Centers
Date: Friday, September 23, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding answers on Google’s apparent attempts to throttle the online ads and reach of pregnancy resource centers.
Senator Hawley wrote,
“I am concerned that, in the name of providing ‘clarity’ in search results, your company is deliberately limiting pregnancy resource centers’ outreach efforts. By doing so, Google has joined the far left’s campaign to punish pregnancy resource centers, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
earlier this year.”
After a steep decline in online traffic to some Missouri pregnancy resource center websites, Senator Hawley requested answers to the following questions:
Has Google adopted a general policy restricting the range of advertising keywords available to pregnancy resource centers, or other organizations that seek to reach individuals considering abortion by offering relevant alternatives to the procedure in question?
When and how often are individual organizations seeking to target abortion-related keywords required to undergo Google’s “certification” process?

or below.
September 22, 2022
Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google, LLC
1600 Amphitheater Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
As part of their mission, pregnancy resource centers in my home state of Missouri seek to reach women considering abortion, in order to offer both alternatives to abortion and support during and after their pregnancies. That outreach takes a number of forms, including online ad campaigns focused on a number of abortion-related search terms.
But recently, your company appears to have throttled that outreach. Following steep declines in online traffic to their sites, they sought further information—and documentation provided to my office indicates that some of their ads now “aren’t eligible to show for keywords that relate to restricted products or services.” To be clear, those are your company’s words, not mine. I am concerned that, in the name of providing “clarity” in search results, your company is deliberately limiting pregnancy resource centers’ outreach efforts.
By doing so, Google has joined the far left’s campaign to punish pregnancy resource centers, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization earlier this year. When those attacks first began to materialize, 17 state Attorneys General wrote to you to stress that “Google’s search results must not be subject to left-wing political pressure, which would actively harm women seeking essential assistance.”
Yet your company doesn’t seem to have heeded that warning. Just two months ago, Sen. Mark Warner bragged that Democrats had successfully partnered with Google: as he put it, “Soon, those who search for ‘abortion clinics near me’ will only see facilities that have been verified to provide abortions in the local search box on Google, meaning that far fewer women will be mistakenly led to ‘crisis pregnancy centers[.]’” Apparently, numerous pregnancy resource centers across Missouri have now fallen victim to this smear campaign.
It strikes me as vanishingly unlikely that your company would impose similar restrictions on other advertisers offering “substitute goods.” And the consequences of this unequal treatment will be grim: mothers and infants deterred from accessing crucial support in their time of need. That outcome is unacceptable.
Please provide my office with responses to the following questions as soon as possible:
1. Has Google adopted a general policy restricting the range of advertising keywords available to pregnancy resource centers, or other organizations that seek to reach individuals considering abortion by offering relevant alternatives to the procedure in question?
2. When and how often are individual organizations seeking to target abortion-related keywords required to undergo Google’s “certification” process?
I look forward to your reply.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Calls for Release of Investigation into DoD Denial of Vax Mandate Religious Exemptions
Date: Thursday, September 22, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Defense (DoD) Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell calling on him to release all information related to his office’s investigation into DoD’s refusal to grant servicemembers religious exemptions to DoD’s Covid vaccine mandate.
On June 2, 2022, Inspector General O’Donnell’s office reportedly
sent Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin a memo
raising serious concerns about DoD’s processes for reviewing servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions. Thousands of servicemembers filed for religious exemptions but DoD reportedly only approved a fraction of the requests.
“Servicemembers commit their lives to the defense of our nation. As part of that compact, they are assured they will have the right to petition the Department of Defense for exemptions to certain requirements that violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The Department’s apparent failure to honor that compact is a betrayal of those servicemembers’ trust. It also endangers our nation’s defense by forcing servicemembers and those considering joining the military to question whether this is really an institution to which they are comfortable dedicating their lives,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
Senator Hawley requested Inspector General O’Donnell provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with the June 2 memo, all material associated with the investigation described in the memo, and any response received from Secretary Austin or his staff, by Sept. 30, 2022.

September 22, 2022
Sean O’Donnell
Acting Inspector General
Office of Inspector General
U.S. Department of Defense
4800 Mark Center Drive
Alexandria, VA 22350-1500
Dear Mr. O’Donnell,
I write to request information regarding the Office of the Inspector General’s investigation into how the U.S. military handled servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Public reporting this week is cause for serious concern that the Biden Administration has not reviewed such requests in a fair and lawful manner.
A public report states that you sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on June 2, 2022, raising concerns about the military services’ processes for adjudicating religious exemption requests.[i] According to the report, you wrote, “We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies…. Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.” You reportedly went on to inform the Secretary:
“The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning…. Assuming a 10-hour workday with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.”
These findings are alarming. If true, not only do they suggest that the military services failed to satisfy all legal and regulatory obligations when reviewing servicemembers’ requests for religious exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. They also raise very serious concerns about the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s apparent failure to promulgate or enforce lawful guidance for reviewing such requests. This is not to mention concerns about Department leaders’ apparent attempt to conceal these failures. Indeed, it is not lost on me that you reportedly sent this memo on June 2, yet Congress is only now learning of it.
Servicemembers commit their lives to the defense of our nation. As part of that compact, they are assured they will have the right to petition the Department of Defense for exemptions to certain requirements that violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The Department’s apparent failure to honor that compact is a betrayal of those servicemembers’ trust. It also endangers our nation’s defense by forcing servicemembers and those considering joining the military to question whether this is really an institution to which they are comfortable dedicating their lives. This implication is particularly concerning now as the U.S. military struggles to meet recruiting goals.
Given the stakes at hand, it falls upon Congress to investigate how the U.S. military handled requests for religious exemptions. To that end, please provide the June 2 memo and all material associated with the investigation described in the June 2 memo to the Senate Armed Services Committee no later than September 30. Please modify such material only as required to safeguard servicemembers’ identities or other protected information. Please also provide any response from the Secretary or his staff to the June 2 memo. This material will allow the committee to conduct all appropriate oversight, including hearings.
Thank you for your cooperation on this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Introduces New Legislation to Hold Universities Accountable for Rising Tuition Costs and Student Debt
Date: Wednesday, September 21, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Make the Universities Pay Act
—
new legislation
to reform the nation’s higher education financing system and put universities on the hook for the creditworthiness of future student loans and the debt of students who default.
College tuition increases consistently outpace the rise of inflation, the nation’s student loan debt balance has skyrocketed to almost $2 trillion, and lackluster student performance calls into serious question whether ballooning costs and indebtedness are worth the investment: only about half of college enrollees complete a degree within six years.
“For decades, universities have amassed billion-dollar endowments while teaching nonsense like men can get pregnant. All while charging extortionary tuition,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Now Joe Biden wants to give away another $1 trillion to prop up the system. That’s wrong. Instead, it’s time to put universities on the hook and give students the information they need to make informed decisions.”
On August 24, 2022,
President Biden announced a series of executive actions
on student loan debt. These actions usurp authorities given to Congress in the Constitution, constitute an estimated $1 trillion wealth transfer from those who have attended college to the majority of Americans who have not, and lack much-needed reforms to the nation’s broken higher education financing system.
Senator Hawley’s
Make the Universities Pay Act
will:
Going forward, require institutions of higher education participating in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to pay 50 percent of any student loan balance that is in default.
Institutions of higher education are prohibited from increasing the cost of attendance in order to offset this liability unless there is an equivalent percentage decrease in administrative expenses at the institution.
Allow student loan debt to be discharged in bankruptcy.
Undergraduate student loan debt can be discharged five years after the first payment is due, while graduate student loan can be discharged fifteen years after the first payment is due.
Require each institution of higher education participating in federal financial aid programs to publish post-graduate outcomes, including mean and median earnings of graduates and student loan default rates, disaggregated by each degree or program of study.
In 2019, Senator Hawley
introduced two pieces of legislation
to break up the higher education monopoly, provide more options for career training, and to hold universities accountable for student outcomes.

Title: Hawley Blasts Mayorkas: Over Two Million Illegal Crossings, You Must Resign
Date: Wednesday, September 21, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called for
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign for his failure to enforce our country’s immigration laws. A record-breaking 2 million illegal migrants have crossed the southern border just this fiscal year, and illegal drugs coming over the border are destroying communities across America.
“Your total abdication of responsibility to secure the border has consequences. It has resulted in a record 78 individuals on a terror watchlist entering our country this year alone,”
said Senator Hawley.
During a Senate Committee hearing
exactly one year ago, on Sept. 21, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas told Senator Hawley that DHS was executing a plan and was personally committed to securing the southern border.

The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretary Mayorkas,
I write with alarm over record-setting levels of illegal immigration into our country. According to your own department’s statistics, Customs & Border Protection agents have now encountered over 2 million illegal immigrants crossing our southern border this fiscal year. This is substantially higher than last year’s record 1.7 million encounters, and the year is still not even over. This number represents more than a four-fold increase in illegal immigration compared to FY 2020. And these are only the official statistics, which fail to capture the many got-aways who evaded detection. After two years on the job, you have demonstrated that you have no intention of enforcing our immigration laws.
Your total abdication of responsibility to secure the border has consequences. It has resulted in a record 78 individuals on a terror watchlist entering our country this year alone. And those are only the ones we know about.
Those entering our country are also smuggling lethal drugs, like fentanyl, that are destroying our communities. In my state of Missouri, the leading cause of death among adults ages 18 to 44 is drug overdose—and 70% of these deaths involve opioids. As I recently wrote to the Drug Enforcement Administration, we are now seeing the proliferation of so-called rainbow fentanyl, specifically manufactured to resemble candy and appeal to children and teenagers. These drug cartels apparently believe they are clear to operate at our southern border.
One year ago, on September 21, 2021, you testified under oath before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in response to my questioning, that “We have a plan, we our executing on our plan, and we will continue to do so.” You went so far as to say your plan “is in fact working.” At the time, our country was experiencing 200,000 illegal immigrant encounters per month. I asked you whether you considered this a “success.” Now, we have already eclipsed last year’s records. So let me ask you again, exactly one year later, was this your plan? Do you consider 2 million illegal immigrants crossing our border to be a success?
Sadly, I think you do. This was the predictable result of your open border policies. Your intentional disregard for our country’s immigration laws makes you unfit to remain in office. You should resign.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley to Biden Admin: TikTok Must Fully Divest from ByteDance, End CCP Data Collection
Date: Monday, September 19, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to require TikTok to sever all ties from ByteDance and any other Chinese companies.
Senator Hawley wrote, “Last week, the Chief Operating Officer of TikTok testified in response to my questions that TikTok indeed has engineers in China who are able to access American user data and that the company has taken no measures to ensure that the employees in China accessing this data are not members of the Chinese Communist Party.”
He concluded, “This shocking testimony calls for action. I am therefore writing to you to exercise your responsibilities as Chair of CFIUS to ensure that the Chinese company ByteDance fully divests TikTok and that TikTok sever any connections with any other Chinese company. President Trump issued an order requiring divestiture in August 2020, but President Biden declined to enforce it when he took office. That was a mistake. Fortunately, it is not too late for a correction.”
Senator Hawley has previously
introduced
legislation to ban TikTok on government devices.

Janet Yellen
Secretary
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Ave, NW
Washington, DC 20220
Dear Secretary Yellen,
I write with alarm about recent reports that actors in China have repeatedly accessed the data of U.S. citizens who used the social media app TikTok. Last week, the Chief Operating Officer of TikTok testified in response to my questions that TikTok indeed has engineers in China who are able to access American user data and that the company has taken no measures to ensure that the employees in China accessing this data are not members of the Chinese Communist Party. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which you chair, should require TikTok to sever all ties from Chinese companies. TikTok should be entirely divested from ByteDance.
I have long warned about this problem. As I explained during a hearing I chaired on this issue in 2020, “TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership, and it is required by Chinese law to share user data with Beijing. TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risk for the American people.”
TikTok has responded by saying that it no longer sends data to China. TikTok says, “We store all TikTok US user data in the United States,” and in sworn testimony before a Senate subcommittee, TikTok executive Michael Beckerman quoted a Citizen Lab report that said, “In our testing, TikTok did not contact any servers within China.”
Subsequent reports paint a different picture: TikTok is in fact sending data on Americans to China, where it is vulnerable to spying by the Chinese Communist government. BuzzFeed News reported that at least “nine different TikTok employees” have “indicat[ed] that engineers in China had access to US data between September 2021 and January 2022.” Leaked recordings indicate that “Everything is seen in China,” including by one Beijing-based engineer who “has access to everything.” The report concluded that “the company may have misled lawmakers, its users, and the public by downplaying that data stored in the US could still be accessed by employees in China.”
Last week, I questioned TikTok COO Vanessa Pappas during her testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Contrary to TikTok’s previous statements, Ms. Pappas acknowledged that TikTok has employees based in China who do access users’ data. She also said that TikTok takes no steps to prevent employees accessing this data from being members of the Chinese Communist Party.
This shocking testimony calls for action. I am therefore writing to you to exercise your responsibilities as Chair of CFIUS to ensure that the Chinese company ByteDance fully divests TikTok and that TikTok sever any connections with any other Chinese company. President Trump issued an order requiring divestiture in August 2020, but President Biden declined to enforce it when he took office. That was a mistake. Fortunately, it is not too late for a correction.
I am copying Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan so the FTC can determine whether TikTok has violated federal laws, including by engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: ICYMI: Senator Hawley Speaks at National Conservatism Conference
Date: Friday, September 16, 2022

Content:
This week U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
delivered a speech
at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami, Florida.
“Whatever your own beliefs, whatever your background, the revolution of the Bible is worth defending. It is worth preserving. It is the true source of the rights of man and the liberties we cherish. It has taught us what we know of dignity and equality. The Bible has made us who we are. And it is critical to our future,”
said Senator Hawley.
[. . .]
The Bible gave us also the idea of a state ruled by men, not by gods. It gave us the distinction between church and state. It gave us equality between men and women. And more, much more. But you get the idea.
These were revolutionary notions that upended the ancient world. And they found their purest political expression in the United States of America.
The biblical revolution is right there in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that “all men are created equal,” that we are endowed by our Creator with “unalienable” rights. These confessions would take centuries to realize in this country, but we recognized them as true from the first.
The biblical revolution is there in our Constitution, which separates powers among offices and stations to ensure the common person can rule, and no clique or elite.
It is there in the Bill of Rights that guarantees freedom to worship, to speak, to assemble, and to exercise one’s faith free from government interference.
The biblical tradition echoes in the great tent revivals of the frontier, where hardscrabble folks with little to their name heard from the itinerant preachers that they too were called by God. They too could be God’s servants. You didn’t need a fancy education or a landed estate to be God’s child. And those revivals helped spawn a populist political movement that reverberates to this day.
America as we know it, America as we love it, is the product of the revolution of the Bible. But now that biblical inheritance is under siege.
[. . .]
The woke left now controls the commanding heights of American culture: the media, the entertainment industry, the corporations, academia, and government. They seek to marshal their combined cultural power against those who disagree.
They seek to shame us, to isolate us—to silence us, if they can. They seek to protect their power. And they can succeed—but only if we allow them.
In truth, their vision is bleak and their ideology is brittle. They do not understand the deep strength of the American people, because they do not understand the deep goodness of their character. They see only deplorables who must be re-educated.
They do not understand our history and our ideals because they do not appreciate the truths on which this nation is based. They do not realize these truths have made us good and made us strong. And truth is their problem. The woke ideology, this warmed-over cultural Marxism, is not true.
Race and class do not define all that we are. Society is not an unending struggle for power and domination. And America is not structurally defective. America is the best and freest nation in the history of the world. And it is so largely because of the biblical revolution that made us what we are.
And now we need that inheritance again. In this time of fear and despair, we need to hear again that our lives matter—that we are loved by God—that we are called by God to great purpose—and that eternity beckons. What we do now can last. What we do here can matter.
We need to hear again of the dignity of ordinary life, of work and hearth and home, of the joys of marriage and family, and the power of these things to shape the future.

Title: Hawley, Rubio & Colleagues Introduce Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act
Date: Friday, September 16, 2022

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and 12 Republican Senate colleagues in introducing the
Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act
to combat the rise of fentanyl being trafficked across our southern border and into our communities.
The Illicit use of fentanyl is now the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18-45. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, drug dealers are increasingly targeting children and young people with fentanyl pills made to look like candy.
“The Biden border crisis has caused an epidemic of fentanyl flooding our communities, and the results have been deadly. It’s time to get serious about holding illegal fentanyl traffickers responsible,”
said Senator Hawley.
“Fentanyl is killing Americans at a record high. This deadly drug is widespread throughout our country and has left no community untouched. This bill would make drug dealers pay the price for selling deadly fentanyl,”
said Senator Rubio.
The bill is cosponsored by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss).
The
Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act
would:
Punish knowing distribution of fentanyl the same as murder when a person dies as a result of that distribution
Increase the current penalty from a minimum of 20 years to a minimum of life in prison
Act as a major deterrent for drug-dealing

Title: Hawley Legislation to Create Senate Select Committee on Biden’s Botched Afghan Withdrawal
Date: Wednesday, September 14, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced
legislation
to establish a Senate Select Committee, granting full subpoena power to investigate and report on President Joe Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, which left 13 American service members dead.
“Joe Biden is desperate to evade responsibility for his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, but the American people deserve better. They deserve to know why the Administration ignored warnings that Kabul could collapse, why they delayed evacuating Americans until it was too late, and why they failed to protect our servicemembers or even vet Afghan evacuees before they came to the United States,”
said Senator Hawley. “My bill will make sure the American people get the answers – and accountability – they deserve.”
Senator Hawley’s resolution will:
Establish a 20-member Senate Select Committee on the Afghanistan withdrawal.
Task the Senate Select Committee to investigate and report on:
Intelligence available, including dissenting views, during the withdrawal.
The Administration’s failure to begin evacuation operations quickly enough.
The Administration’s decision to prioritize evacuating as many people as possible over protecting U.S. servicemembers and civilians.
The Administration’s failure to thoroughly vet evacuees.
Americans left in Afghanistan after the withdrawal and U.S. officials’ knowledge of the same when they testified that no Americans were left behind.
Empower the Senate Select Committee to gather information by issuing subpoenas and taking, or ordering the taking of, depositions, including of former U.S. officials.
Prohibit U.S. officials from withholding information from the Senate Select Committee, including for reasons of classification, executive privilege, or attorney-client privilege.
Require the Senate Select Committee to hold open hearings with the National Security Advisor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and other key officials, including ground commanders, in the interest of public transparency.
Senator Hawley has continually
demanded
accountability from the Biden Administration for the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. He introduced a
resolution
honoring Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz and each of the 56 Missourians who gave their lives during the war in Afghanistan. The resolution passed the Senate unanimously in September 2021.
Most recently, Senators Hawley and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a
letter
to the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) calling for an immediate investigation into new DoD whistleblower allegations about the withdrawal.
In response, the DoD OIG announced they will open a review into the whistleblower allegations including the Biden Administration’s failure to properly vet hundreds of Afghan evacuees who have entered the United States, despite appearing on a DoD watchlist that includes known suspected terrorists.

Dear Mr. Kelly, Mr. Miebach, and Mr. Squeri:
I write to express serious concern with your decision to separately categorize gun-related purchases from other retail transactions made with your payment cards so that firearm purchases can be more easily tracked. This move has been described by multiple media outlets as “a major win for gun control advocates,” and they are not wrong. This new system is ripe for abuse and brings to mind similar policies of Big Tech companies and payment processors that have targeted law-abiding Americans for engaging in constitutionally protected activities. I urge you to immediately reverse course.
Too often, companies have abused their market power to target the constitutional rights of conservatives and others with minority viewpoints. Big Tech companies systematically deplatformed those who sought to discuss the efficacy of masks and vaccines or raise concerns about the integrity of our elections. The crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the Canadian “Freedom Rally” trucker convoy. And WePay, a payment processor subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase—the largest bank in the United States—refused to do business with Missouri conservatives seeking to host an event with Donald Trump, Jr. Your proposal to track firearm-related purchases further threatens Americans who are simply exercising their constitutional rights.
The Second Amendment is clear: the right of the people to keep and bear arms is guaranteed to law-abiding citizens and “shall not be infringed.” Whether this infringement is by the federal government or powerful corporations seeking to ostracize citizens for exercising their rights, I will oppose all attempts to undermine the Second Amendment’s protections.
Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and other payment card companies should not distinguish lawful firearm-related purchases from other retail purchases. Americans have had enough of massive companies using their market power to drive ordinary people out of the public square. These practices must end.
I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Responding
to a letter from U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General (OIG)
announced
they will review whistleblower allegations that the Biden Administration failed to properly vet hundreds of Afghan evacuees who have entered the United States, despite appearing on a DoD watchlist that includes known suspected terrorists.
DoD OIG also announced they will review allegations that DoD and National Security Council officials cut corners and “did not follow proper procedures when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases.”
In August, Senators Hawley and Johnson
sent a letter
to DoD OIG calling for an immediate investigation into new DoD whistleblower allegations, including:
The Biden Administration evacuated 324 individuals from Afghanistan into the United States who appeared on DoD’s watchlist, which includes known suspected terrorists.
The White House and DoD officials directed agency personnel to cut corners and not conduct full fingerprint tests of Afghan evacuees.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staff have been authorized to delete old biometric data, whenever they personally believe such information is out of date, which could compromise the integrity of existing databases and undermine national security.

Dear Ranking Member Johnson and Senator Hawley,
This is in response to your August 4, 2022 letter requesting that the Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) review whistleblower allegations that hundreds of Afghan evacuees were allowed to enter the United States despite appearing on the DoD’s Biometrically Enabled Watchlist, and that officials at the National Security Council and DoD did not follow proper procedures when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases.
As part of our ongoing body of work on Afghan evacuees, we are initiating an evaluation, to commence in the first quarter of FY 2023, to address your questions pertaining to the DoD’s role in reviewing DoD databases for information on Afghan evacuees when requested by other agencies. In February 2022, we issued Report No. DODIG-2022-065, “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan,” that detailed the extent to which the DoD managed and tracked displaced persons from Afghanistan through the biometric enrollment, screening, and vetting process. In addition, we have an ongoing evaluation on security and life support practices for Afghan evacuees at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.
For the remainder of the questions in your letter, we determined that the OIGs for the respective agencies with jurisdiction over those matters, copied on my response, are better suited to respond.
We appreciate your interest in our work and we will keep you informed about the progress about our current and future work. If you have any additional questions, please contact me or direct your staff to contact Mr. Michael C. Zola, Assistant Inspector General for Legislative Affairs and Communications, at (703) 604-8324.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Answers from DEA on Rainbow Fentanyl Being Peddled to Children
Date: Wednesday, September 07, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrator Anne Milgram calling for an urgent update on the steps being taken to counter new, so-called “rainbow fentanyl” designed to appeal to children. The DEA recently
issued a warning
on the deadly drug.
“Issuing a warning is a step in the right direction. But it is not enough. We should stop the flow of deadly drugs across from the southern border, seize all rainbow fentanyl contraband, and imprison all who manufacture and distribute these horrible drugs,”
said Senator Hawley.

and below:
September 7, 2022
The Honorable Anne Milgram
Administrator
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
8701 Morisettte Drive
Springfield, VA 22152
Dear Administrator Milgram,
I write with concern over recent reports of seizures, including in Missouri, of so-called rainbow fentanyl. This new form of brightly-colored fentanyl is particularly concerning as it seems designed to resemble candy and appeal to children and teenagers.
The United States continues to grapple with an epidemic of overdose and addiction in Missouri and across the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 107,622 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2021, a new annual record. Fentanyl, due to its potent addictiveness and lethality, is the main driver of this epidemic and was responsible for the deaths of 71,238 Americans last year, a 23 percent increase over 2020. In Missouri, fentanyl and its analogs were responsible for 1,204 overdose deaths in 2020, constituting 64 percent of all overdose deaths in the state.
On August 30, 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a warning about so-called rainbow fentanyl, which your agency says is a “deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults.” The warning noted that the DEA has seized brightly-colored fentanyl in 18 states and that the drug is being found in all forms, including pills, powder, and blocks resembling chalk. Two of the recent seizures occurred in St. Louis, Missouri.
Issuing a warning is a step in the right direction. But it is not enough. We should stop the flow of deadly drugs across from the southern border, seize all rainbow fentanyl contraband, and imprison all who manufacture and distribute these horrible drugs.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by September 15, 2022:
1. Please detail how the DEA is working with state and local law enforcement to raise awareness of rainbow fentanyl.
2. Please detail how the DEA is working with primary and secondary schools to inform parents and their children about the prevalence of rainbow fentanyl and how to identify it.
3. The DEA’s recent warning about rainbow fentanyl notes that Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the majority of fentanyl entering the United States. What steps is DEA taking to combat fentanyl trafficking by these cartels?
4. How is the DEA coordinating with Customs and Border Protection to stop the smuggling of rainbow fentanyl and other drugs into the United States?
5. Is the DEA coordinating with Mexican law enforcement to trace the origins of this new form of fentanyl?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,

Title: Senator Hawley Tours Fort Leonard Wood, Continues Pressing for Answers on Housing Conditions
Date: Wednesday, August 17, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
delivered remarks
on the important work being done at Fort Leonard Wood to strengthen our nation’s military. He also visited with Fort Leonard Wood residents about
base housing in need of replacement.
Two weeks ago, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth requesting an update on the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
Earlier this year, he
pressed
Secretary Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about military housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
In June 2021, Senator Hawley
asked
the Secretary and General McConville for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing on base. Following that exchange, the Army confirmed it had allocated funding for housing at Fort Leonard Wood. More recently, however, the Army informed the Senator’s office that funding was no longer available. Concerned by the Army’s lack of progress, Senator Hawley demanded answers directly from the Army’s leaders.
While visiting Fort Leonard Wood Senator Hawley also
met with
Major General Jim Bonner, Command Sergeant Major Delapena, and Colonel Hilburgh.

Title: Senator Hawley Pushes Army for Updates on Fort Leonard Wood Housing
Date: Friday, August 05, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth requesting an update on the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
Senator Hawley asked Secretary Wormuth about this issue at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on
May 5, 2022. This latest inquiry comes as the Army appears to be going back on its pledge to allocate funding for new homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
“Servicemembers at Fort Leonard Wood do vital work to protect our nation. It is the Army’s responsibility to care for those servicemembers and their families, in kind. Yet that does not appear to be happening when it comes to housing,”
said Senator Hawley.

here
and below:
August 5, 2022
Honorable Christine Wormuth
Secretary of the Army
101 Army Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20310-0101
Dear Secretary Wormuth,
I am writing to request information on the Department of the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood.
Fort Leonard Wood is the proud home of the U.S. Army’s Maneuver Support Center of Excellence, including the Army Engineer School, Army CBRN School, and Army Military Police School. Fort Leonard Wood is also one of five locations where the Army conducts Basic Combat Training for new recruits. And Fort Leonard Wood provides unparalleled opportunities for joint training to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps detachments located on the installation.
Servicemembers at Fort Leonard Wood do vital work to protect our nation. It is the Army’s responsibility to care for those servicemembers and their families, in kind. Yet that does not appear to be happening when it comes to housing.
During a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) hearing on June 15, 2021, I asked you and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville about the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. I explained the concerns raised by servicemembers and their families about those homes. You responded with an update on the Army’s efforts to improve housing. General McConville then assured me this issue was one of the Army’s top priorities and promised additional information about the Army’s efforts at Fort Leonard Wood, in particular.
The next week, Army Materiel Command and Army Installation Management Command informed my office that “Balfour Beatty Corporation is working a private investment initiative that will make as much as $340M available to improve BBC housing across the Army portfolio beginning later this year.” My office engaged the Army shortly thereafter to learn exactly how much would be allocated for Fort Leonard Wood. Army officials then informed us that less than $50 million would be made available to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. We informed the Army at the time that this amount was insufficient to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. Army officials agreed with our assessment and assured us they would work to provide a solution as quickly as possible.
But that has not happened. To the contrary, things only got worse over the following year. This culminated with the Army notifying my office on May 3, 2022, that the private investment initiative cited by the Army in earlier exchanges was no longer viable. As a result, Army officials told us, the $50 million originally intended for Fort Leonard Wood was no longer available. Put succinctly, the Army had neither funds nor any idea how it was going to generate funds to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements.
I raised this issue with you – again – at a SASC hearing on May 5, 2022. During our exchange, you committed to investigate the matter and provide me with an update on the Army’s plan to meet Fort Leonard Wood’s housing requirements. Nearly three months have passed, and I have received no update.
No doubt many of the housing challenges facing the Army are a result of public-private partnerships that have failed to perform as expected. And private companies should be held responsible for their failures to meet their obligations to provide quality housing to our servicemembers. But it is Army – not these companies – that is ultimately responsible for caring for servicemembers and their families at Fort Leonard Wood.
– With these concerns in mind, I request your written responses to the following questions no later than August 12, 2022:
– What is the Army’s assessment of the total number of homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?
– What is the Army’s assessment of how much it will cost to replace those homes?
– How does the Army plan to fund the replacement of all the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?
– What is the Army’s timeline for replacing all of the homes at Fort Leonard Wood that need to be replaced?
Ensuring quality housing for servicemembers and their families at Fort Leonard Wood is a top priority for the people of Missouri. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senators Hawley, Blunt, Missouri Congressional Delegation Support Request for Major Disaster Declaration Following Historic Flooding
Date: Friday, August 05, 2022

Content:
Today Senators Hawley (R-Mo.), Blunt (R-Mo.), and the Missouri Congressional delegation
sent a letter
to President Biden in support of Missouri Governor Mike Parson’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the City of St. Louis, as well as St. Louis, St. Charles, and Montgomery counties in Missouri overwhelmed by severe weather and flash flooding.
Record setting rainfall caused flash flooding in the St Louis region leading to hundreds of home evacuations and, tragically, two deaths. The Preliminary Damage Assessment determined over $35 million in damages and emergency response costs have been incurred by the local governments. A Major Disaster Declaration could provide much-needed federal resources and programs, such as debris removal, infrastructure and home repairs, rental assistance, and small business disaster loans.
Earlier this week, Senator Hawley
met with FEMA, local officials, and residents
while touring flood damage at public buildings and residences across the St. Louis region.
Other letter signatories include: Representatives Cori Bush (MO-1), Ann Wagner (MO-2),  Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3), Vicky Hartzler (MO-4), Emanuel Cleaver, II. (MO-5), Sam Graves (MO-6), Billy Long (MO-7) and Jason Smith (MO-8).
The Missouri lawmakers wrote, “We respectfully request your prompt action to ensure that these communities receive the immediate federal support needed to respond to the disaster. Along with our fellow Missourians, we appreciate your attention to this request and stand by ready to assist in any way possible.”

Title: Senators Hawley, Johnson Expose New Whistleblower Allegations About Biden Failure to Vet Afghan Evacuees
Date: Thursday, August 04, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.)
sent a letter
to Department of Defense (DoD) Acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell calling for an immediate investigation into new DoD whistleblower allegations that the Biden Administration failed to properly vet individuals evacuated from Afghanistan.
The whistleblower alleges:
The Biden Administration evacuated 324 individuals from Afghanistan into the United States who appeared on DoD’s watchlist, which includes known suspected terrorists.
The White House and DoD officials directed agency personnel to cut corners and not conduct full fingerprint tests of Afghan evacuees.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staff have been authorized to delete old biometric data, whenever they personally believe such information is out of date, which could compromise the integrity of existing databases and undermine national security.
Senators Hawley and Johnson wrote, “we write to you with concern over new allegations raised by a Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblower. This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office.”

Sean O’Donnell
Acting Inspector General
Department of Defense
4800 Mark Center Dr.
Alexandria, VA 22305
Dear Acting Inspector General O’Donnell,
We write to you with concern over new allegations raised by a Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblower. This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office.
You previously issued a report titled “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan.”Among other things, you found that “Afghan evacuees were not vetted by the National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC) using all DoD data prior to arriving in” the United States. In particular, we were troubled to learn that DoD “personnel identified Afghans with derogatory information in the DoD [Automated Biometric Identification System] database who were believed to be in the United States.”At the time of the report, DoD “personnel had identified 50 Afghan personnel in the United States with information in DoD records that would indicate potentially significant security concerns,” but we understand that number has risen to at least 65.  These individuals need to be immediately located, fully vetted, and, if appropriate, deported.
A patriotic whistleblower paints an even darker picture. According to new allegations, 324 individuals evacuated from Afghanistan were allowed to enter the United States, despite appearing on the DoD’s Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL). The BEWL—commonly known as “the watch list”—identifies individuals whose biometrics have been collected and determined by analysts to be threats or potential threats to national security, including known suspected terrorists (KST). This is in addition to the reportedly 65 individuals who are known to have entered the country without adequate vetting.
Furthermore, the whistleblower alleges that political appointees at the National Security Council (NSC) and DoD instructed agency personnel to cut corners when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases in Europe, also known as “lily pads.” According to the whistleblower rather than administer fingerprint tests on all ten fingers, personnel were told to abbreviate their tests in order to promote the rushed evacuation from Afghanistan.
Finally, it is alleged that personnel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who work on vetting Afghan evacuees have been authorized to delete old biometric data, whenever they personally believed that such information is out of date. This is a troubling development that could threaten national security and public safety.
We write to request you open an immediate investigation into these alarming allegations and specifically respond to the following:
How many BEWL matches were generated by biometric submissions from Afghan evacuees?
How many of these individuals were denied entry into the United States?
How many of these individuals were admitted into the United States?
How many of these individuals are currently in the United States?
How many BEWL matches were generated by evacuees after their arrival into the United States?
What steps have been taken to identify, vet, and, if appropriate, deport these BEWL matched individuals from the United States?
How many BEWL matches were for individuals designated as known suspected terrorists?
Have those who remain on the BEWL been investigated by the FBI or other law enforcement entities?
Did political appointees at NSC or DoD instruct personnel to administer abbreviated fingerprint tests to Afghan evacuees? If so, were all Afghan evacuees ultimately administered 10-finger tests?
Under what conditions may agency personnel delete biometric information? Has any biometric information associated with Afghan evacuees been deleted?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Grills Wray on Whistleblower Allegations that Biden Admin Cut Corners on Afghan Vetting
Date: Thursday, August 04, 2022

Content:
Whistleblower claims hundreds on the DoD watchlist – a list including known suspected terrorists – were let into the U.S. last year after the administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan
Today U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray over
new whistleblower allegations
that the Biden administration failed to properly vet individuals evacuated from Afghanistan, and allowed more than 300 evacuees —  who are on a DOD watchlist that includes known suspected terrorists — to enter the United States.
Senator Hawley asked,
“Here’s my question…according to this whistleblower’s allegations, there are 324 individuals who were evacuated from Afghanistan and were allowed to enter the United States despite appearing on DOD’s biometrically enabled watchlist…that identifies folks whose biometrics have been collected and determined to be threats or potential threats to national security, including known suspected terrorists.”
He continued,
“Of any of these nearly 400 individuals who apparently have been brought to this country despite having some connection to terrorism, have you interviewed any of them? Have you apprehended any of them?”
FBI Director Wray did not immediately answer Senator Hawley’s questions.

Title: FBI Director Stonewalls Senator Hawley’s Questions on FBI’s ‘Audit’ of MO Concealed Carry Permits
Date: Thursday, August 04, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray about the FBI’s
planned audit
of Missouri’s sheriffs’ offices’ records of concealed carry permits. Last week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Director Wray demanding answers, but has yet to receive a reply.
Senator Hawley said, “This is of significant concern, it directly affects Missouri state law. You’ve praised your local law enforcement partners earlier today Director. You are putting them in a terrible position in the state of Missouri. State law says they cannot turn over these personal records, the sheriffs cannot. You are asking them to, apparently in an unprecedented manner.”
He continued, “I want to know what in the world you’re doing with this, and frankly, I don’t like the fact that the FBI is snooping around the records of the concealed carry permits of Missourians.”
FBI Director Wray claimed he did not know the details of the audit and was unable to provide a response to Senator Hawley’s line of questioning, stating that he will respond in writing to Senator Hawley’s
letter.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Why I Won’t Vote to Add Sweden and Finland to NATO
Date: Monday, August 01, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) | August 1, 2022 |
National Interest
The Senate will soon vote on adding Sweden and Finland to NATO. According to the terms of NATO’s founding treaty, that means the United States would be obliged to defend both countries in the event of a military attack. I intend to vote no.
Finland and Sweden want to join the Atlantic Alliance to head off further Russian aggression in Europe. That is entirely understandable given their location and security needs. But America’s greatest foreign adversary doesn’t loom over Europe. It looms in Asia. I am talking of course about the People’s Republic of China. And when it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.
[…]
Confronting this threat will force us to make tough choices. As the 2018 and 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategies both acknowledge, the United States cannot defeat China and Russia in two major wars at the same time. And we are not where we need to be in Asia. The U.S. is currently not prepared to fend off Chinese military aggression in the Pacific. Our forces are not postured as they should be. And we do not have the arms and equipment there we need, not least because we have been distracted for too long by nation-building activities in the Middle East and legacy commitments in Europe. In the face of this stark reality, we must choose. We must do less in Europe (and elsewhere) in order to prioritize China and Asia.
To be clear, America shouldn’t abandon NATO. But it’s time for our European allies to do more. In particular, they must take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe by investing more in their own militaries. All the way back in 2006, NATO member states pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on national defense. It should be higher. The United States spends far more than that on defense. But many NATO members still haven’t met even this minimal commitment.
And this isn’t just about U.S. interests. For our allies, it’s also a matter of self-preservation. If NATO member states aren’t prepared to defend themselves, they risk serious danger if U.S. forces are pulled from Europe into a crisis in the Asia-Pacific. Every European nation must now make the necessary investments to prepare themselves for a new threat environment, or risk the worst.
[…]
For decades, NATO stood as a bulwark against a militant Soviet Union, protecting the Western world by blocking Communism’s westward expansion. But more than three decades after the Soviet Union’s fall, the geopolitical landscape is very different. Russia is still a threat, but the Chinese Communist Party is a far greater one. And a truly strategic American foreign policy—one that looks to this nation’s strategic interests now, rather than the world of years ago—must embrace this reality, and prepare for it.

Title: Hawley Demands Answers on FBI’s ‘Audit’ of Missouri Concealed Carry Permit Holders
Date: Friday, July 29, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray, asking why he is directing FBI agents to conduct ‘audits’ of Missouri county sheriffs’ records of concealed carry weapons permit holders.
“Missouri is a state filled with law-abiding gun owners. There’s no pressing need for federal bureaucrats to collect information about who they are and other information on their applications for concealed carry permits,”
said Senator Hawley. “Indeed, restricting who can access that information has been a priority for Missouri lawmakers for years: limitations on the distribution of firearm owner information have been codified into Missouri law to prevent the very scenario we’re seeing here.”
Senator Hawley emphasized that the increasing politicalization of the FBI is a major cause for concern, and that Missourians and their sheriffs have every right to be skeptical of the FBI’s intentions.

July 29, 2022
The Honorable Christopher A. Wray Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20535
Dear Director Wray:
Despite being fresh off a punishing loss at the Supreme Court in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Biden Administration has made clear that it won’t stop chipping away at Americans’ Second Amendment rights. Specifically, FBI agents under your authority are planning to visit Missouri county sheriffs in order to “audit” their records of concealed carry weapons permit holders.
In the weeks since the announcement, numerous sheriffs and gun owners have expressed concern over the scope and purpose of this audit. As one sheriff recently put it, “I was elected to protect [Missouri residents’] rights and their freedoms and to uphold the laws. That is a law in the state of Missouri that we don’t give out that private information.” I have also heard from numerous constituents that they are alarmed by the FBI’s recent actions.
Missouri is a state filled with law-abiding gun owners. There’s no pressing need for federal bureaucrats to collect information about who they are and other information on their applications for concealed carry permits. Indeed, restricting who can access that information has been a priority for Missouri lawmakers for years: limitations on the distribution of firearm owner information have been codified into Missouri law to prevent the very scenario we’re seeing here.
Under your leadership, the FBI has become increasingly politicized. As a result, Missourians and their sheriffs have every reason to be skeptical of the FBI’s intentions. For the benefit of Missouri firearms owners and the public at large, you should explain why the FBI has aggressively sought information about concealed carry permit holders in Missouri.
Please provide my office with answers to the following questions:
How many Missouri sheriffs does the FBI intend to visit for purposes of records audits?
In what other states, if any, is the FBI conducting similar audits?
What specific concealed carry information, and how many records, does the FBI intend to review?
How long does the FBI intend to retain records seized, and for what purposes?
What action steps does the FBI intend to take following these audits?
I await your response.
Sincerely,

Title: Hawley Calls for FTC Review of Amazon’s One Medical Acquisition
Date: Thursday, July 28, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Amazon’s planned acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, a medical company that oversees an extensive network of primary care providers. If allowed to go forward, this transaction will give Amazon
access
to a healthcare practice operating more than 180 medical offices throughout the United States.
“This particular acquisition, if allowed to proceed, would represent an alarming new direction for a company that already wields far too much power. Most importantly, this acquisition would provide Amazon with access to enormous tranches of patient data,”
Senator Hawley wrote. “Scenarios once written off as scaremongering fictions are now a very real possibility. For instance, if an individual is diagnosed with high blood pressure by a One Medical doctor, will he later be advertised over-the-counter blood pressure medications whenever he shops at Whole Foods Market? Promoting wellness is one thing; dystopian corporate ‘nudging’ is quite another.”
Senator Hawley notes that this acquisition will allow Amazon to enter a new market and subsequently use its considerable resources to become a dominant player, eliminating choices for patients and making Americans dependent on Amazon in disturbing new ways.

Commissioner Christine Wilson
Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20580
Dear Chair Khan and Commissioners Phillips, Slaughter, Wilson, and Bedoya:
On July 21, news broke that Amazon had agreed to purchase the medical company 1Life Healthcare, which offers primary care services under its One Medical brand. I realize that the FTC is currently engaged in numerous efforts to combat America’s accelerating economic concentration and the power of tech behemoths. Nevertheless, I urge you to prioritize a searching review of this particular transaction.
This particular acquisition, if allowed to proceed, would represent an alarming new direction for a company that already wields far too much power. Most importantly, this acquisition would provide Amazon with access to enormous tranches of patient data. While HIPAA and other privacy laws exist to thwart the worst potential abuses, loopholes exist in every legal framework. Scenarios once written off as scaremongering fictions are now a very real possibility. For instance, if an individual is diagnosed with high blood pressure by a One Medical doctor, will he later be advertised over-the-counter blood pressure medications whenever he shops at Whole Foods Market? Promoting wellness is one thing; dystopian corporate “nudging” is quite another.
This acquisition also further reinforces Amazon’s market power—despite, no doubt, the company’s protestations to the contrary. It doesn’t matter if the primary care market as such is presently competitive: by having its hand in dozens of smaller markets, Amazon positions itself to eventually emerge as the dominant player in each, as cross-subsidization allows Amazon to offer services at a loss and data-driven network effects allow Amazon to market at a level its competitors cannot match. A market might be competitive now, but a few years after Amazon gets involved, it won’t be.
Americans’ privacy and safety are now on the line in a wholly new way. Amazon shouldn’t be allowed to buy its way into this industry.
As you conduct your review, Amazon should be pressed to answer the following questions:
– Why did Amazon decide to pursue this acquisition in the first place?
– What, if any, firewalls does Amazon intend to establish between patient data and retail customer data?
– What products does Amazon intend to develop in the wake of this acquisition
– Given Amazon’s strength across numerous other markets, if the transaction goes forward, what steps is Amazon likely to subsequently take to expand One Medical’s operations and undercut competitor providers?
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Peters Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Advance DHS Efforts to Detect and Seize Illicit Drugs
Date: Wednesday, July 27, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced the
Enhancing DHS Drug Seizures Act
— a bipartisan bill to ensure that the Department of the Homeland Security (DHS) is efficiently using existing resources and expanding available tools to stop the flow of deadly and illicit drugs like fentanyl into our nation.
“Illicit drugs such as fentanyl are devastating communities and families across the country, including those in Missouri,”
said Senator Hawley. “In order to crack down on drug cartels and criminals operating across our southern border, we need to give the Department of Homeland Security the right tools and resources to root out drug smuggling and improve interdiction efforts. I’m proud to work with Chairman Peters on bipartisan solutions to address the ongoing opioid crisis.”
Chairman Peters said, “The opioid crisis continues to devastate communities in Michigan and across our country. That is why we must use every tool at our disposal to fight back against trafficking and seize these drugs before they can harm Americans. By bolstering the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to reduce the supply of dangerous drugs like fentanyl in the United States, this bipartisan bill will help reduce overdoses and save lives.”
Bill text can be found
here.
Background:
The
Enhancing DHS Drug Seizures Act
would:
Provide solutions to assist DHS with its counter drug mission while also holding DHS accountable for assessing and improving its efforts.
Ensure that DHS is utilizing available resources to develop additional ways to test for fentanyl and other illicit drugs. It also requires DHS to study how they can improve efforts to collect and analyze data on illegal drug seizures.
Enhance penalties for drug traffickers who knowingly and willfully surveil, track, monitor, or transmit information about the location and movement of enforcement officials and those who destroy border technology, such as sensors and cameras, in order to smuggle drugs into the United States.

Title: Following Pelosi Trades, Hawley Calls for Hearing on Banning Insider Trading in Congress
Date: Wednesday, July 20, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) calling for a hearing to consider bipartisan proposals to ban insider stock trading by members of Congress and their spouses. The letter follows recent
revelations
that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband invested millions of dollars in computer-chip stocks as Congress was preparing to vote on legislation to subsidize the chip-manufacturing industry.
“It has been more than six months since members of this Committee proposed measures to put an end to inappropriate financial transactions. Despite these efforts, Speaker Pelosi and her husband remain undeterred from cashing in,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “More than 70% of Americans agree that this is unacceptable and that Congress shouldn’t be trading stocks at all.  After all, clean government in Washington begins with Members of Congress putting the American people first—and not lining their own pockets.”
Senator Hawley previously
introduced
the
Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act, which would prohibit Members of Congress and their spouses from trading individual stocks and require Members found in violation to return their profits to the American people.

July 20, 2022
The Honorable Gary Peters
Chairman
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
340 Senate Dirksen Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairman Peters:
I write to request that, as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), you convene a hearing as soon as practicable to consider bipartisan, bicameral solutions to banning insider stock trading by Members of Congress and their spouses.
This issue of whether and how Members of Congress engage in various financial transactions deserves scrutiny by the Committee. For example, recent reports show that Speaker Pelosi’s family continues to engage in what is arguably inappropriate stock trading activities. According to reports, her husband Paul Pelosi recently purchased 20,000 shares of Nvidia, a multinational semiconductor company, worth between $1 million and $5 million. This trade came ahead of a likely vote in the Senate that could set aside $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and give tax credits for production.
This specific trade raises serious questions, but it’s nothing new. Last year, Speaker Pelosi’s biggest financial gains came from her husband exercising options to purchase shares of Google just one week before the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on antitrust legislation that would impact Big Tech companies. In 2020, Speaker Pelosi and her husband outperformed the S&P 500 by a whopping 14.3 percent.
Members on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation to address this problem. I am proud to have introduced S.3504, the Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act. Senators Ossoff and Kelly have introduced S.3494, the Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act. Senators Merkley, Brown, and Warnock have introduced S.564, the Ban Conflicted Trading Act. Senators Warren and Daines have introduced S.3631, Bipartisan Ban on Congressional Stock Ownership Act. And Senator Gillibrand introduced S.3612, the STOCK Act 2.0. My bill and others were referred to the Committee. This suggests that there is a clear interest from our colleagues in taking action to address unethical stock trades. An oversight hearing would provide an opportunity to debate these various proposals and determine points of consensus in order to move forward.
It has been more than six months since members of this Committee proposed measures to put an end to inappropriate financial transactions. Despite these efforts, Speaker Pelosi and her husband remain undeterred from cashing in. More than 70% of Americans agree that this is unacceptable and that Congress shouldn’t be trading stocks at all. After all, clean government in Washington begins with Members of Congress putting the American people first—and not lining their own pockets.
I appreciate your willingness to discuss this issue with me previously. I believe the time has come for the Committee to hold an oversight hearing focusing specifically on banning Members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks. Let’s get this done.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Bill to Crack Down on McKinsey, Management Consultants’ China Contracts
Date: Monday, July 18, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Time to Choose Act
which would prohibit the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms like McKinsey & Company who are simultaneously providing services to the Chinese government or its affiliates. The bill would force these government contractors to choose whether to stand with the United States in its efforts to protect Americans against China’s imperial ambitions, or forfeit U.S. government contracts.
“The fact that these consultants are awarded huge contracts by our Defense Department and other federal agencies, while they are simultaneously working to advance China’s efforts to coerce the United States is appalling and completely unacceptable,”
said Senator Hawley. “It is well past time that we hold these companies accountable and prohibit this kind of conflict of interest in government contracting.”
Recent reporting has
revealed
that McKinsey & Co., which regularly receives multi-million dollar contracts from federal agencies like DOD, has also contracted with Chinese state-owned entities that have been blacklisted by the U.S. for actively undermining American national security.
The
Time to Choose Act
would:
Prohibit federal agencies from contracting with consulting firms that hold a contract with the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party, or subsidiaries, affiliates, or proxies thereof.
Impose penalties on consulting firms that intentionally hide or misrepresent contracts with the Chinese entities described above, including:
Terminating affected federal contracts.
Debarring relevant firms from future work with the federal government.
Requiring relevant firms to pay damages equivalent to three times the amount spent by the U.S. government on or in support of the solicitation, selection, or performance of such contracts, pursuant to the
False Claims Act.

Title: New Hawley Bill to Crack Down on Left-Wing Attacks on Pregnancy Resource Centers, Churches
Date: Thursday, July 14, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Pregnancy Resource Center Defense Act
to protect these centers and houses of worship from radical pro-abortion activists’ campaign of violence, destruction, and intimidation.
“The Biden Administration has turned a blind eye while radical leftists attack pregnancy care centers and houses of worship,”
said Senator Hawley. “And now left-wing politicians are trying to shut them down. It’s time to put an end to the attacks and get tough on thugs who engage in violence, arson, and other means of destruction.”
Following the leak of the draft opinion from the Supreme Court on
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there have been
at least 50 separate incidents
of violent attacks, including arson, against pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life organizations across the country. Churches and other religious facilities have also faced an increase in violence, including
more than 150 recent attacks
on Catholic churches and sites. Militant leftist groups like Jane’s Revenge have promised these attacks and vandalism will continue. And left-wing politicians are making it their mission to
shut down
pregnancy care centers.
Attacks against pregnancy resource centers and churches are illegal under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, but the penalty for a first-time offense is only a misdemeanor.
The
Pregnancy Resource Center Defense Act
would bolster penalties for attacking pregnancy resource centers as well as houses of worship by:
Increasing criminal penalties from a misdemeanor to a felony for first-time offenses, and increasing the criminal fine from $10,000 to $25,000
Guaranteeing that pregnancy resource centers and religious facilities that successfully sue will receive no less than $20,000 (a $10,000 increase)
Imposing a 7-year mandatory minimum when attacks involve arson (up from a 5-year mandatory minimum)

Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.)  introduced the bipartisan
Fire Station Improvement Act of 2022
to help local fire departments make improvements, repairs, and renovations at their local facilities.
“Every day, America’s firefighters put their lives on the line for their communities. At a bare minimum, Congress should ensure that these brave men and women have what they need to succeed, including access to the best tools, facilities, and resources,”
said Senator Hawley. “I’m proud to partner with Senator Ossoff on this legislation that will cut red tape so firefighters can have the tools to do their jobs.”
“When your home is on fire, every minute counts for you and your children. There’s no worse nightmare than a fire in the middle of the night but no timely rescue. My bipartisan
Fire Station Improvement Act of 2022
will help ensure every family and every community in Georgia is served by fire and rescue services,”
said Senator Ossoff.
“This bill will help Georgia’s heroic firefighters upgrade their facilities to the highest standards.”
This bill will amend the
Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act, and cut the red tape that limits the use of funds from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.

Since taking office, Senator Hawley has been committed to introducing legislation and improving laws to help America’s first responders in every line of defense. Senator Hawley
introduced
the Supporting and Treating Officers In Crisis Act of 2019 which funds grant programs that provide support services for police officers and their families, which passed the Senate unanimously. Senator Hawley also

the National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act which met a critical need for FEMA access to more volunteers to get to disaster areas and rescue survivors faster.
Both bills were signed into law in 2019 with bipartisan support.

Title: Hawley Calls for Investigation Into Biden’s Release of Emergency Oil Reserves to China, Foreign Competitors
Date: Wednesday, July 13, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Department of Energy (DOE) Inspector General Teri Donaldson demanding she investigate President Joe Biden’s recent ongoing release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to foreign competitors, including China.
New reporting
has revealed that, as a result of Biden’s unprecedented release of oil from America’s emergency reserves, more than 5 million barrels of oil have already been shipped overseas to American competitors, draining the SPR to its lowest level since 1985.
“While Americans are paying record gasoline and diesel fuel prices, the Biden administration appears to have been letting our strategic oil stockpiles flow to foreign countries and entities,”
Senator Hawley wrote. “Critically, the American people deserve answers as to how exactly the Department justified sending oil from the SPR to China. DOE’s recent transfer of nearly one million barrels of oil to UNIPEC is just one concerning example.”
Senator Hawley called for IG Donaldson to explain, among other things, whether DOE has any internal controls in place to prevent the transfer of oil to countries like China and to quantify exactly how many barrels of oil ultimately served foreign markets.

July 13, 2022
Teri L. Donaldson
Inspector General
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue
SW Washington, DC 20585
Dear Inspector General Donaldson,
I urge you to immediately open an investigation into the Department of Energy’s (DOE) recent releases of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to foreign countries including China. The SPR exists to protect and serve Americans, not foreign entities or adversaries. It is incumbent upon your office to determine the possibility of gross administrative misconduct with respect to these sales which may damage American energy security.
While Americans are paying record gasoline and diesel fuel prices, the Biden administration appears to have been letting our strategic oil stockpiles flow to foreign countries and entities. Critically, the American people deserve answers as to how exactly the Department justified sending oil from the SPR to China. DOE’s recent transfer of nearly one million barrels of oil to UNIPEC is just one concerning example. That company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Chinese State-Owned Enterprise (SOE). This all comes at a time when the SPR’s level has fallen to about 492 million barrels of oil, the lowest level since 1985, due to the Department’s scheduled releases of nearly one million barrels per day.
These actions by the Department fall squarely within the scope of activities your office exists to root out. The Inspector General’s office is empowered to investigate allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse with priority given to investigations of serious administrative misconduct. This includes the detection of contract fraud and issues that reflect on the integrity and credibility of Department officials. The process by which oil reserves were released to foreign adversaries such as China merits such investigation.
In order for Congress to consider legislation to improve oversight or operations of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, please respond to the following questions by July 29th, 2022:
Does the Department have any internal controls in place to prevent the   transfer of oil from the SPR to foreign entities with ties to China?
How many barrels of oil from the SPR ultimately went to American refineries? How many ultimately served foreign markets?
How could the qualifications or limitations the Department considers during the contracting process be improved to ensure releases from the SPR serve to improve the supply and affordability of energy for American citizens?
Were any controls in place to ensure oil from the SPR would go to serve American markets? How could these be improved?
Did Department officials follow the statutory requirement to consult with the Secretary of Defense on SPR releases? Did the Secretary of Defense raise any concerns regarding any transfer of the SPR to any foreign government or Chinese state-owned enterprise?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: WATCH: Far-Left Berkeley Law Professor Melts Down When Senator Hawley Asks Her If Men Can Get Pregnant
Date: Tuesday, July 12, 2022

Content:
Today in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked Berkeley Law professor Khiara M. Bridges to clarify what she meant by the term ‘people with a capacity for pregnancy.’ She responded by calling Senator Hawley’s line of questioning “transphobic.” Below is an excerpt of the exchange:
Hawley
: I just want to clear one thing up, Professor Bridges. You said several times, you’ve used a phrase, I want to make sure I understand what you mean by it. You’ve referred to people with ‘a capacity for pregnancy.’ Would that be women?
Bridges: Many women, cis women, have the capacity for pregnancy. Many cis women do not have the capacity for pregnancy. There are also trans men who are capable of pregnancy as well as non binary people who are capable of pregnancy.
Hawley
: So this isn’t really a women’s rights issue….
Bridges: We can recognize that this impacts women while also recognizing that it impacts other groups. Those things are not mutually exclusive, Senator Hawley.
Hawley
: Alright, so your view is that the core of this right then is about what?
Bridges: So I want to recognize that your line of questioning is transphobic. It opens up trans people to violence by not recognizing them.
Hawley
: Wow. You’re saying that I’m opening up people to violence by asking whether or not women are the folks who can have pregnancies?
Following the hearing, Senator Hawley issued the following statement:

Title: Hawley Leads Letter Demanding Blinken Reinstate Nigeria to Religious Freedom ‘Concern’ List For Violence Against Christians
Date: Wednesday, June 29, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging him to immediately redesignate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act. Recent acts of violence targeting Nigerian Christians have underscored the deteriorating state of religious freedom in the country. Joining Senator Hawley’s letter are Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.),Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).
“Religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years. One report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021. Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honor—for the second consecutive year—of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians,”
the senators wrote.
They continued, “Given the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year’s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.”
Senator Hawley and his colleagues
first wrote
to Secretary Blinken on this matter in December 2021, after the State Department inexplicably removed Nigeria from the CPC list.
You can read the entire letter
here
and below:
June 29, 2022
The Honorable Antony Blinken Secretary
United States Department of State
2201 C St NW
Washington, D.C. 20520
Dear Secretary Blinken:
As you are well aware, horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student. Sadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa’s most populous country. Last year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria’s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country’s religious freedom conditions. On the contrary, the situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.
Recent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians. On Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria’s Ondo state, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers. Last month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in northwest Nigeria. According to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a “blasphemous” message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that “Jesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.” Merely expressing one’s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria.
Religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years. One report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021. Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honor—for the second consecutive year—of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.
We wrote last year that “[n]ot only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges.” We remain concerned that the Nigerian government is failing to protect the religious freedom and basic safety of its Christian citizens. Furthermore, as this year’s annual reports from the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and from your own Department make clear, Nigerian government authorities directly participate in the persecution of Christians, Muslims, and even non-theists, most notoriously through arrests and convictions under blasphemy laws. Make no mistake: continued enforcement of state-sanctioned blasphemy laws enables the type of deadly violence that killed Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu and so many others.
When we previously wrote you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom” or even “severe violations of religious freedom.” This is unacceptable, especially because you are required by federal law to consider the recommendation of USCIRF—which, since 2009, has been to designate Nigeria as a CPC. In fact, USCIRF reiterated in its 2022 Annual Report that it was “appalled” at the removal of Nigeria’s CPC designation. Despite public statements from you and other State Department officials condemning the recent bloodshed in Nigeria, the fact remains that the Department still does not officially regard Nigeria as a severe violator of religious freedom.
The State Department released its 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the Department to make its religious freedom designations. Given the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year’s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.
We look forward to your swift action on this important matter.

Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Leads 11 Republican Colleagues in New Letter Opposing FY23 NDAA Forcing Women to Register for Draft
Date: Wednesday, June 15, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
today to Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Chairman Jack Reed opposing any attempt to use the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to force American women to register for the U.S. Selective Service System. Senator Hawley, who was a leader on this
issue
last year, was joined by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Jim Risch (R-Idaho).
“Women have served in and alongside the Armed Forces since our nation’s founding. Time and again, they have answered the call of duty and served honorably – often heroically – when our nation needed them. But they have done so of their own will. While American men are required to register for the military draft and fight if needed, these requirements have never been applied to American women. Where they have fought, they have done so freely,”
the Senators wrote.
They concluded, “we urge you in the strongest possible terms not to use this year’s NDAA to try to force America’s women to register for the military draft. Reviving these efforts would be a grave mistake and would needlessly inject divisive social policies into important debates over our national security.”

The Honorable Jack Reed
Chairman
Committee on Armed Services
United States Senate
228 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Chairman Reed,
We write in opposition to any attempt to use the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to force American women to register for the military draft.
Women have served in and alongside the Armed Forces since our nation’s founding. Time and again, they have answered the call of duty and served honorably – often heroically – when our nation needed them. But they have done so of their own will. While American men are required to register for the military draft and fight if needed, these requirements have never been applied to American women. Where they have fought, they have done so freely.
This approach has served our nation well, and it retains broad bipartisan support. Indeed, a majority of American women oppose changing it. Yet that is exactly what the Biden administration and its Congressional allies tried to do last year by inserting language in the Senate and House versions of the FY22 NDAA to require American women to register for the military draft.
Many of our constituents were shocked and concerned when they learned of these efforts to send American women to war against their will, and they asked us to do everything in our power to prevent the new requirement from becoming law. Fortunately, their advocacy paid off. The final version of the FY22 NDAA did not require American women to register for the military draft.
We were pleased with that outcome, but we also believe it never should have gotten that far in the first place. This in mind, as we begin the FY23 NDAA process, we urge you in the strongest possible terms not to use this year’s NDAA to try to force America’s women to register for the military draft. Reviving these efforts would be a grave mistake and would needlessly inject divisive social policies into important debates over our national security.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,

Title: Hawley Blasts Garland’s Failure to Act on Threats Against Justices, Attacks on Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers
Date: Wednesday, June 15, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding answers as to why the Department of Justice (DOJ) has failed to enforce the law against illegal protests at the homes of Supreme Court Justices, especially after the attempted assassination of Justice Kavanaugh. Senator Hawley also called on the DOJ to take immediate action against the criminals responsible for the recent firebombings of pro-life pregnancy resource centers across the country.
“When Democratic officials openly say that it is fine to flout the law and commit crimes, radicals take note,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
“That is why it was so outrageous that, hours after the assassination attempt, your office did not immediately arrest illegal picketers who surrounded Justice Kavanaugh’s house in a renewed attempt to intimidate. Dangerous persons see the failure to enforce the law, and they grow bold.”
Senator Hawley notes that the Biden Administration has refused to condemn the illegal protests and prominent Democrats have openly encouraged them. Senator Hawley also cites recent reporting that shows at least
13 crisis pregnancy centers
have been attacked since the leak of the draft
Dobbs
opinion.
Read the entire letter
here
and below:
June 14, 2022
The Honorable Merrick Garland Attorney General
United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
Just hours after a man tried to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh, far-left agitators flocked outside his house in brazen violation of federal law. Meanwhile, there is an epidemic of pro-abortion attacks on pregnancy resource centers across the country, and there have been few, if any, arrests. To tamp down on this wave of violence, you must immediately stand up and enforce the law, prosecute those who break it, and condemn the violent rhetoric coming from the left.
The assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh’s life on June 8 by a man armed with a gun, a knife, and burglary tools did not happen in a vacuum. Activists and even elected officials have openly threatened the Justices. Two years ago, when the Supreme Court last was ruling on a case about abortion, Senator Chuck Schumer took to the steps of the Supreme Court and threatened Justice Kavanaugh by name. He said, “I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Other politicians have unfortunately followed this example. After the draft Supreme Court opinion was leaked last month, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said, “This moment has to be a call to arms.”1
In addition to explicit threats by the left, Democratic officials have encouraged other illegal activity against Justices. As you know from my previous letter dated May 10, 2022, federal law makes it a crime to picket or parade in front of a Justice’s home. 18 U.S.C. §1507. And the Supreme Court has already upheld statutes like this one. Cox v. State of La., 379 U.S. 559 (1965). Yet on May 10, then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki noted the picketing occurring at Justice’s homes and said, “We certainly continue to encourage that outside of judges’ homes.” Senate Majority Leader Schumer similarly told reporters that demonstrations outside the homes of Supreme Court Justices are “OK with me” —even though they are a federal crime.
All of this rhetoric emboldens not only the man who tried to take the life of Justice Kavanaugh, but also the radicals who have attacked pregnancy resource centers across the country. According to a recent report, “attacks against crisis pregnancy centers, some of them faith-based, have risen steadily since the leak of a draft opinion” last month but that “police have made few arrests, if any.” The report identifies at least attacks in the last month, including arson and firebombing attacks. This is a disgrace.
When Democratic officials openly say that it is fine to flout the law and commit crimes, radicals take note. That is why it was so outrageous that, hours after the assassination attempt, your office did not immediately arrest illegal picketers who surrounded Justice Kavanaugh’s house in a renewed attempt to intimidate. Dangerous persons see the failure to enforce the law, and they grow bold.
You wrote in a letter to me on June 8, 2022, that you are taking measures to increase judicial safety. But taking safety seriously requires that you immediately move to counter all illegal activity directed at Supreme Court Justices, as well as all other crimes committed by radical leftists. Please respond to this letter with a full account of why your office did not immediately arrest those who illegally flocked around Justice Kavanaugh’s home on June 8, in violation of §1507, hours after the assassination attempt and also why you are dragging your feet on arresting criminals for the firebombing of pregnancy resource centers across the country.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Following Whistleblower Revelations, HSGAC Republicans Demand Hearing on Biden Disinformation Governance Board
Date: Tuesday, June 14, 2022

Content:
Following the release of new
whistleblower documents
last week obtained by U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on details of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Disinformation Governance Board, U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Republicans have sent a letter to Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-Mich.) requesting a new hearing with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding his
misleading testimony
before the Committee on the matter on May 4. Ranking Member Rob Portman (R-Ohio), along with Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) sent the letter.
“We write to request you convene a hearing with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as possible to answer critical questions about apparently misleading testimony before the Committee on May 4 on the Department of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board (the Board). We are deeply concerned that documents recently obtained by Senators Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley contradict the Secretary’s testimony and public statements about the Board,”
wrote the senators.
“The American public deserves transparency and honest answers to important questions about the true nature and purpose of the Disinformation Governance Board and it is clear that Secretary Mayorkas has not provided them—to the public or this Committee. Therefore, we request you hold a hearing with Secretary Mayorkas and join us in insisting that all records related to the Board be provided to the Committee prior to the hearing.”
The full letter can be found below and
here.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
We write to request you convene a hearing with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as possible to answer critical questions about apparently misleading testimony before the Committee on May 4 on the Department of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board (the Board).   We are deeply concerned that documents recently obtained by Senators Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley contradict the Secretary’s testimony and public statements about the Board.
At the May 4 hearing, Secretary Mayorkas testified that the Board “has not yet begun its work.”   Yet the documents indicate the Secretary had stood up the Board on February 24, 2022—more than two months earlier.   The Board’s charter, signed by the Secretary, required the Board meet “regularly” and “no less than once per quarter.”   Another document dated only six days before Secretary Mayorkas appeared before the Committee provides preparatory materials for a meeting between Under Secretary for Policy Robert Silvers and Twitter.   The document was prepared by Ms. Nina Jankowicz in her capacity as “Executive Director DHS Disinformation Governance Board,” clearly evidencing that the Board had already begun its work.
Based on the documents received, Secretary Mayorkas also misrepresented the nature and scope of the Board in his testimony and public statements.  Responding to a question from a reporter “Will American citizens be monitored?” Secretary Mayorkas responded unequivocally “No,” adding that “We at the Department of Homeland Security don’t monitor American citizens.”   He went on to suggest the Board would be concentrating on foreign threats—“addressing the threat of disinformation from foreign state adversaries [and] from the cartels.”   Yet talking points prepared by Ms. Jankowicz, the Board’s then–Executive Director appear to show that the Department does in fact monitor American citizens and that the Board’s work is concentrated on domestic threats.  She writes that the Board’s initial work plan includes working with “industry on countering MDM [mis-, dis-, or mal-information] related to domestic violent extremism” further noting that the Department recently established a “domestic terrorism branch” within the Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis—the Department’s office responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence.   A September 13, 2021, memorandum from Under Secretary Silvers recommending the establishment of the disinformation board also lists several other categories of domestic homeland security disinformation that the board could address including “conspiracy theories about the validity and security of elections,” and domestic violent extremism.   In a related example at the May 4 hearing, Senator Rand Paul questioned Secretary Mayorkas saying “I said a million times that masks don’t work . . . You’re going to take that down?”  Secretary Mayorkas responded, “it’s not for us to take that down . . . we are not the public health experts to make that determination.”   Yet in the above referenced memorandum to the Secretary, Under Secretary Silvers lists “disinformation related to the origins and effects of COVID-19 vaccines or the efficacy of masks” as the second example of homeland security disinformation the Board would be established to coordinate efforts to counter.
We are also troubled that Secretary Mayorkas failed to provide these documents to the Committee.  But for the actions of a whistleblower, it is unlikely any of this information would have come to light.  The Secretary failed to provide the Committee these key documents despite a request from Senator Hawley to Secretary Mayorkas at the May 4 hearing that the Secretary provide the Committee with “documents pertaining to the board” and the Secretary’s assurances that “we owe you documents with respect to the work of this board that are already in existence” and that “we will produce the documents that you have requested unless there is a legal prohibition from us doing so.”
The American public deserves transparency and honest answers to important questions about the true nature and purpose of the Disinformation Governance board and it is clear that Secretary Mayorkas has not provided them—to the public or this Committee.  Therefore, we request you hold a hearing with Secretary Mayorkas and join us in insisting that all records related to the Board be provided to the Committee prior to the hearing.
Sincerely,

Title: Hawley, Cotton, Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gun Violence
Date: Friday, June 10, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Kennedy (R-La.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.) introduced the Stop Gun Criminals Act, legislation to increase penalties for felons who illegally possess or use firearms. Text of the bill can be found
here.
“Violent criminals have no business being anywhere around guns. If they get them, they should go to prison even longer than they currently do—keeping law-abiding Americans safe demands no less,”
said Senator Hawley.
“And while we’re at it, it’s past time to ensure prosecutors have the tools they need to put repeat offenders behind bars for a long time. This bill does both.”
“Violent felons commit the vast majority of gun crimes and should be held accountable for their actions. Instead of releasing criminals onto the streets to commit more crime, our bill will establish mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders,”
said Senator Cotton.
The Stop Gun Criminals Act would:
Set a minimum sentence of five years for illegally possessing a gun.
Increase the mandatory minimum sentence for criminals who use a gun in the commission of another crime from five years to seven years.
For such criminals who brandish the gun during the crime, the minimum would increase from seven years to 10 years.
For such criminals who actually fire their weapon during the crime, the minimum would increase from 10 years to 15 years.
Make a technical correction to update the “residual clause” from the Armed Career Criminal Act, in light of recent Supreme Court precedent.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Join Warner in Reintroducing Bipartisan Bill to Encourage Competition in Social Media
Date: Wednesday, June 08, 2022

Content:
The ACCESS Act will require the largest social media companies to make data portable and services interoperable
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), and a group of bipartisan colleagues recently reintroduced
the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act.
This bipartisan legislation encourages market-based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring that the largest companies make user data portable – and their services interoperable – with other platforms.
Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are original cosponsors of the legislation. Senator Hawley was also an
original cosponsor
of the
ACCESS Act
last Congress.
“The tremendous dominance of a handful of large social media platforms has major downsides – including few options for consumers who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,”
the senators said. “As we learned in the Microsoft antitrust case, interoperability and portability are powerful tools to restrain anti-competitive behaviors and promote innovative new companies. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. Additionally, empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words – by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will create long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another.”
BACKGROUND:
The
Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching
(ACCESS) Act would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.) to:
Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms.
Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user’s best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.

Title: Hawley Slams Biden Nominee for Advocating to Axe Mandatory Minimums for Child Porn Offenders, Calls Out Durbin for Blocking His Legislation Protecting Children
Date: Wednesday, June 08, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) slammed President Biden’s U.S. Sentencing Commission nominee Laura Mate for refusing to explain her opposition to mandatory minimums for child porn offenders in all cases, following a 2013 letter she signed in which she argued that the child pornography guidelines were too severe and called for mandatory minimums for offenders to be abolished.
“You don’t want to answer my questions, because the positions that you took were radical, and frankly, I think, wrong,”
said Senator Hawley. “I can’t possibly support your nomination. I can’t support the nomination of someone who wants to do away with mandatory minimums. I think it’s a radical position, and I think, frankly, your nomination is indicative of where this administration is on its soft-on-crime policies.”
Chairman Dick Durbin then mentioned the need for Congress to address sentencing reform, to which Senator Hawley stated on-record that Chairman Durbin is single-handedly
blocking his legislation, introduced earlier this year, which would protect children and increase penalties for child porn offenders.

Title: Hawley, Grassley Demand Answers on New Whistleblower Documents Exposing DHS Disinformation Board Efforts to Monitor Americans’ Speech
Date: Wednesday, June 08, 2022

Content:
New whistleblower
documents, obtained by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), expose shocking new details about the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) planned Disinformation Governance Board. The documents reveal that DHS drafted plans for the Disinformation Governance Board as early as September 2021 and explored the possibility of partnerships with Big Tech companies like Twitter to assist in their efforts.
In a
new letter
to Secretary Mayorkas, Senators Hawley and Grassley call for DHS to release all internal communications related to the Disinformation Governance Board and to clarify why he did not fully explain the Disinformation Governance Board’s role in his testimony before Congress.
“The First Amendment of the Constitution was designed precisely so that the government could not censor opposing viewpoints – even if those viewpoints were false. DHS should not in any way seek to enlist the private sector to curb or silence opposing viewpoints. It is therefore imperative for DHS to provide additional clarity regarding its policies and procedures for identifying and addressing ‘MDM,’ as well as its efforts to ‘operationalize’ public-private partnerships and the steps it is taking to ensure that it does not infringe on the constitutional rights of American citizens,”
the senators wrote.
On May 4, 2022, Secretary Mayorkas
testified under oath
to Senator Hawley that the Disinformation Governance Board “had not yet begun its work.” On May 1, 2022, the Secretary
told the news media
that the Board would be focused on disinformation “from foreign state adversaries [and] the cartels” and would not monitor American citizens. At the White House on May 2, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki
claimed
that the Board would be focused on “human traffickers and other transnational criminal organizations.”
In spite of the administration’s claims, the new whistleblower documents reveal:
The Disinformation Governance Board was originally conceived in part to monitor domestic speech regarding “conspiracy theories about the validity and security of elections” and “disinformation related to the origins and effects of COVID-19 vaccines or the efficacy of masks.”
DHS planned for a partnership with Twitter to suppress disfavored content and planned a meeting with Twitter executives exploring the concept.
The Disinformation Governance Board charter was drafted in January 2022 and personally signed by Secretary Mayorkas on February 24, 2022. The document states that the charter goes into effect immediately upon the Secretary’s signing of the document.
Despite the Secretary’s assertion that the Board had not yet begun its work, a planned meeting with social media executives appears to have been staffed by Nina Jankowicz.
DHS officials appear to have prepared legislation to codify a “Rumor Control Program of the Department of Homeland Security to Counter Misinformation, Disinformation, and Malinformation,” including a public-facing website known as “Rumor Control.”

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: No to Neoconservatism
Date: Tuesday, May 24, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  |  May 24, 2022  |
Compact Magazine
Not so long ago, Republicans said they had sworn off nation-building. Following the failure of the neoconservative project in Iraq and Afghanistan, GOP leaders seemed to have learned their lesson. But apparently not. Now nation-building is back with force, with a massive aid package to Ukraine that makes that country a US client state. Up next: a debate over expanding NATO. Many Republicans in Congress have already lined up to support both, almost reflexively. Why? Perhaps because they have forgotten their foreign-policy heritage. They have traded the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt for the globalism of Woodrow Wilson. That’s a mistake. What America needs is not nation-building, but nationalism.
Start with the $40 billion Ukraine package. The cost alone is startling. It is three times what all of Europe has contributed to date and roughly the size of Ukraine’s entire national budget. Speaking of which, the bill includes funds for Ukraine’s treasury to the tune of $8.8 billion. And Biden administration officials suggest they will soon ask for more. This goes far beyond targeted military assistance. This package treats Ukraine as a client state of America, a fraught relationship that will put us on the hook for financing the war and then the reconstruction.
If this isn’t a classic case of misplaced priorities, I don’t know what is. The administration won’t give our own troops a raise that keeps pace with inflation. It won’t secure our southern border. It is dragging its feet on the force-posture changes needed in Asia to counter a rising China. But $40 billion is enough to give every American service member a real raise. It’s enough to build a wall at the border—twice over. And it would address all of our posture needs vis-à-vis Beijing, and then some.
[…]
So why the Republican support for all this? Ideology. For years now, leaders in both parties have enthusiastically advocated a Wilsonian globalism that seeks to remake the world. I say Wilsonian, because the first major figure in US history to advocate it was Woodrow Wilson, elected president in 1912. He disliked the order of independent nation-states, believing it led too often to war. He wanted to replace competition among sovereign nations with a global system of mutual cooperation and international law. He also strenuously favored promoting democracy abroad.
There is a left-wing and a right-wing version of Wilson’s globalism—or if you prefer, liberal hegemony. The left-wing version is multilateralism. It’s the position that America should subordinate itself to supra-national organizations like the United Nations and international courts and seek global approval for the use of American power. The Clinton and Obama administrations pursued it, and now the Biden administration is, too.
The right-wing version is nation-building. This approach seeks to project American power by remaking other nations in our image. Think regime change. The ultimate goal is a soft empire of influence and control around the globe. The neoconservatives are right-wing globalists. The George W. Bush years were their glory days.
But the globalist approach has been wrong from the start. And Republicans of all people should know better. They used to favor something very different, a foreign policy best represented by another presidential contender in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt.
[…]
That kind of robust nationalism is what America needs today. We can’t afford to be isolationists. That would mean letting other nations direct our trade, dictate our interests, and imperil the livelihoods of our people. But nor can we afford further adventures in globalism. Wilsonian foreign policy, left and right, has nearly bankrupted the country, while siphoning away our national sovereignty and decimating our industrial base. The time has come for a policy of national strength, at home and abroad. Republicans should lead the way.

Title: Hawley Leads Letter Demanding DHS Release Documents on Disinformation Governance Board
Date: Monday, May 23, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
led a letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting the immediate release of all documents related to the agency’s recently-shelved Disinformation Governance Board. U.S. Senators and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee members Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) also joined the letter.
Under federal law (5 U.S.C. § 2954), the Department is required provide information and documents to the Homeland Security Committee when five members request it.
“We write to request immediate access to all records and communications related to the Department of Homeland Security’s new Disinformation Governance Board. You promised under oath to make these records available, but to date, our offices still have not received any further information,” t
he Senators wrote.
They continued, “we were pleased to read reports that you have decided to shut down the board in response to the concerns we raised. But it is important that this mistake is not repeated. We are therefore demanding transparency into the Department’s decision-making process so that we can learn why the Department ever thought creating a disinformation board would be a good idea.”
Earlier this month, Senator Hawley introduced the
Dissolving the Disinformation Governance Board Act
which would have immediately dissolved the Disinformation Governance Board and would prohibit DHS from ever replicating its attempt to monitor or censor Americans’ speech.
Senator Hawley also
grilled Secretary Mayorkas
about the Board and his selection of Nina Jankowicz to lead it, slammed the Secretary’s failure to provide clear answers, and called for the Secretary’s resignation.

May 23, 2022
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary
United States Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas,
We write to request immediate access to all records and communications related to the Department of Homeland Security’s new Disinformation Governance Board. You promised under oath to make these records available, but to date, our offices still have not received any further information. We were pleased to read reports that you have decided to shut down the board in response to the concerns we raised. But it is important that this mistake is not repeated. We are therefore demanding transparency into the Department’s decision-making process so that we can learn why the Department ever thought creating a disinformation board would be a good idea.
On May 4, 2022, you testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about the creation of this new board and accepted sole responsibility for appointing Nina Jankowicz as its Executive Director. Surprisingly, you testified that you were not aware of her long history of partisan public statements.
You also testified under oath that you would produce to the Committee all records related to the Board, including its formation and appointment of personnel. You testified, “I owe openness and transparency with this Committee, and we will produce the documents that you have requested, unless there’s a legal prohibition from us doing so.”
Our offices still have not received any of these documents. We are therefore writing to demand immediate access to all records and communications related to the Disinformation Governance Board.
Under 5 U.S.C. § 2954, “An Executive agency, on request of … the [Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee], or any five members thereof, shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.” Pursuant to this authority, and so that the Congress can consider remedial legislation, please immediately produce the following records:
All records related to the Department’s Disinformation Governance Board, including but not limited to:
written or recorded communications concerning the formation of the Board;
the agenda or minutes from any meeting at which the Board’s formation was discussed;
any legal review to determine whether the activities of the Board would be authorized by the Constitution of the United States;
any communications or records about the individuals who would be recruited to serve on the Board;
any communications concerning the appointment of an executive director for the Board; and
any communications with the White House about the formation of the Board or appointment of officials to serve on the Board.
For any documents that are responsive to this request but withheld from the Committee, please identify the name of each document, the date of its creation, the custodian, a summary of its contents, and the basis for withholding the record from the Committee.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: It’s time to end economic handouts for woke corporations
Date: Thursday, May 12, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  |  May 12, 2022  |
Fox News
Big business is no friend to conservatives—that’s been clear for years. And it’s increasingly no friend to America.
In the postwar era just a few decades ago, many corporate leaders could honestly say that they loved this country. Now that seems a stretch.
Today’s multinationals have embraced a toxic blend of offshoring and woke politics, selling out American workers even as they attack American values. But conservatives don’t have to take this behavior any longer.
[…]
CEOs now regularly release jargon-heavy statements denouncing conservative social policies across the board. One Disney higher-up even bragged recently about “adding queerness” to children’s programming wherever she could.
At the same time, these firms are more than happy to pander to Chinese censors to avoid losing access to a lucrative market.
Whenever there’s a whiff of political pushback to all this, a legion of D.C. lobbyists immediately descends to regurgitate the same tired talking points. Inevitably, the lobby groups complain that any consequences for woke corporations, no matter how marginal, will devastate the American economy.
We’re told that the relationship between business and the right is a one-way street: companies can say and do whatever they want, no matter how destructive to conservative principles, and Republicans—simply because they’re Republicans and ostensibly “business-friendly”—need to be OK with it.
It’s time for that free ride to end. Big companies must no longer take support from conservatives for granted. What Congress has given, Congress can also take away. And there are plenty of options for the chopping block.
Let’s start with Disney. Over the years Disney’s copyright protections for characters like Mickey Mouse have been extended further and further into the future, allowing the company to maintain a stranglehold on its ever-increasing intellectual property stockpile. Disney specifically asked Congress for more protections. As Disney doubles down on its hostility to American values, it’s time to start paring those protections back.
[…]
In America, the people—not the corporations—are in charge. Republicans need to start acting like it.

The Senate adopted resolution
S.Res.594
last night, which was
introduced
by U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) last month in honor of three Missouri Police Officers who were killed in the line of duty in March. Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, and Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department lost their lives in service to their communities.
The resolution expresses condolences to their families and also recognizes the countless selfless and heroic actions carried out by local law enforcement officers in Missouri and across the country.
Text of the resolution can be found
here
and below:
Title: Honoring the lives of fallen Missouri police officers and expressing condolences to their families.
Whereas police officers, sheriffs and deputies, and other law enforcement officers serve and protect their communities with honor and sacrifice;
Whereas all individuals in law enforcement put their lives on the line while serving and protecting their local communities;
Whereas when violent crime increases, law enforcement officers and the communities they serve are directly impacted;
Whereas, in the month of March 2022, Missouri experienced violent attacks against police officers, especially in rural areas;
Whereas, in a 20-day period, 6 police officers in Missouri were shot in the line of duty, 3 of whom suffered injuries that were fatal; and
Whereas these fallen officers include—
1.  Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 8, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody;
2.  Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away from injuries sustained in the line of duty on March 11, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody; and
3.  Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 17, 2022, after responding to a disturbance: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
expresses deep condolences for the Missouri police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty;
recognizes the countless selfless and heroic actions carried out by local law enforcement officers;
expresses strong support for police officers and law enforcement officers in rural areas and across the United States that serve and protect their local communities;
recognizes the need to ensure that rural law enforcement departments have the proper equipment, training, and resources necessary to protect officers and the individuals in the communities they serve;

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill to Strip Disney of Special Copyright Protections
Date: Tuesday, May 10, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Copyright Clause Restoration Act, a new bill to strip woke corporations like Disney of special copyright protections. Senator Hawley’s bill would limit new copyright protections to 56 years and make the change retroactive for massive corporations like Disney that have been granted unnecessarily long copyright monopolies.
Senator Hawley said,
“the age of Republican handouts to Big Business is over. Thanks to special copyright protections from Congress, woke corporations like Disney have earned billions while increasingly pandering to woke activists. It’s time to take away Disney’s special privileges and open up a new era of creativity and innovation.”
Under Congress’s current sweetheart deal, companies like Disney have been granted certain copyright protections for up to 120 years—well beyond the original maximum of 28 years. Senator Hawley’s bill would crack down on copyright monopolies to ensure they only last long enough to encourage innovation.
Bill text can be found here.
Background
The
Copyright Clause Restoration Act
would:
Limit new copyrights to 56 years, the same period that persisted for most of the 20th century, which is plenty of incentive to encourage authorship.
Make this change retroactive for the biggest entertainment companies, including Disney, that were granted unnecessarily long monopolies. Under this legislation, Disney would begin to lose protections for some of its oldest and most valuable copyrights.
Delay implementation for certain license holders, to reasonably protect pre-existing contracts.

violent attacks on pro-life organizations, and
intimidation
of Supreme Court Justices. Senator Hawley writes that, despite devoting substantial resources to investigate parents at school board meetings, the Biden DOJ has failed to take action against radical activists who have committed clear violations of federal law.
“Across the nation, radical pro-abortion activists have begun a campaign of violence, destruction, and intimidation in response to the leak of a draft document from the Supreme Court. You must vigorously investigate and prosecute the crimes committed in recent days. The rule of law demands no less,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “This conduct has only one purpose: intimidation. It is also flagrantly illegal. […] The First Amendment is no shield to this illegal conduct. Those upset by the leaks have plenty of places to protest that do not involve intimidation and do not place the Justices and their families at risk.”

The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
Across the nation, radical pro-abortion activists have begun a campaign of violence, destruction, and intimidation in response to the leak of a draft document from the Supreme Court. You must vigorously investigate and prosecute the crimes committed in recent days. The rule of law demands no less.
Video evidence shows dozens of pro-abortion activists surrounding the homes of Supreme Court Justices in an attempt to influence those Justices to change their decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that asks the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. News outlets report that one individual has targeted Justice Kavanaugh in this manner at least five times, and has targeted at least one other Justice. Neighbors have described her conduct as “dangerous.”
This conduct has only one purpose: intimidation. It is also flagrantly illegal. Federal law makes it a crime for a person, “with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty,” to “picket[] or parade[] … in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge.” 18 U.S.C. §1507. The First Amendment is no shield to this illegal conduct. Those upset by the leaks have plenty of places to protest that do not involve intimidation and do not place the Justices and their families at risk. And the Supreme Court already upheld a statute similar to this one, stressing that these laws are critical to democracy. Because “influence or domination by either a hostile or friendly mob … is the very antithesis of due process,” Cox v. State of La., 379 U.S. 559, 562 (1965), the unlawful picketing by these radical activists is nothing less than an attack on the Court itself.
Meanwhile, harrowing reports have arisen in recent days of radical pro-abortion activists attacking pro-life persons and organizations. Over the weekend, criminals firebombed a pro-life organization in Madison, Wisconsin. Along with the arson, they left a threatening note that stated, “If abortions aren’t safe, then you aren’t either.” Luckily, nobody was killed in the violent attack. But next time, the victims might not be so lucky. Your office must investigate and prosecute.
Additionally, radical activists have targeted religious organizations in the past week because those organizations hold pro-life religious beliefs. Those activists vandalized a Catholic church in Boulder, Colorado, with pro-abortion slogans and anti-religion messages. Anti-religion vandalism in recent days also goes well beyond mere spray paint on doors. One radical organization suggested that its members had already stolen from a Catholic church the holiest of its contents—the Eucharist—and intend to destroy it in an act of gross sacrilege. These acts of vandalism are not just hateful; they also clearly violate federal law, which prohibits “intentionally damag[ing] or destroy[ing] the property of a place of religious worship.” 18 U.S.C. §248(a)(3).
Activists around the country also have prevented religious Americans from participating in religious services and plan to do so in the future. Radicals interfered with religious services in Los Angeles this past weekend. This, too, is brazenly illegal under federal law. 18 U.S.C. §248(a)(2).
You must not allow this brazen and unlawful intimidation to go unchecked. Last fall, your Department committed substantial resources to investigating parents at school board meetings. Failure to vigorously investigate and prosecute these crimes would send the message that your Department is only interested in prosecuting the Biden Administration’s political opponents—like parents speaking at school board meetings—leaving victims of actual crimes committed by the far left to fend for themselves. Within two weeks, please respond to my office with a full report about whether you have opened investigations into these cases and the status of those investigations.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Urges Biden Admin to Keep China Tariffs in Place, Open Investigation into Unfair Trade Practices
Date: Monday, May 09, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai
calling
on the Biden Administration to maintain tariffs on Chinese goods and to initiate a new investigation into the Chinese Communist Party’s unfair trade practices.
“China repeatedly violates the rules of international trade and unapologetically steals and cheats in its economic relationship with the United States,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “The objective of these tariffs was to recalibrate the nation’s bilateral trading relationship with our primary economic competitor, and to level the playing field for American workers and communities which have long suffered from unfair practices perpetrated by China after its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.”
He continued, “Tariffs on Chinese goods are important tools our nation must use as part of a long-term strategy in its geoeconomic competition with China. I therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to use your influence within the Biden Administration to reject the short-sighted position advocated by your colleagues.”
Although
tariffs
on Chinese imports are critical tools for leveling the playing field for American workers, Biden Administration officials in recent weeks have expressed a desire to cut them. Senator Hawley urged Ambassador Tai to keep the tariffs in place, and asked why her office has yet to open a new investigation into malicious Chinese practices that have harmed American industry.
Read the letter
here
and below:
The Honorable Katherine Tai
U.S. Trade Representative
Office of the United State Trade Representative
600 17th Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20508
Dear Ambassador Tai,
I write with concern about recent comments from Biden Administration officials that indicate a desire to cut tariffs on goods imported from China. I urge you to reject this misguided policy proposal. I further write to inquire about the status of a new Section 301 investigation into the malicious economic practices deployed by the Chinese Communist Party, which harm American workers and industry and must be combatted with the full weight of your office.
Following an investigation conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Trump Administration documented what many Americans have long known: China repeatedly violates the rules of international trade and unapologetically steals and cheats in its economic relationship with the United States. Pursuant to the findings of the investigation, the Trump Administration levied tariffs on a broad basket of Chinese goods. The objective of these tariffs was to recalibrate the nation’s bilateral trading relationship with our primary economic competitor, and to level the playing field for American workers and communities which have long suffered from unfair practices perpetrated by China after its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Tariffs on Chinese goods enjoy broad support among the American people. Unfortunately, certain officials within the Biden Administration seem to disfavor them, and have, in recent weeks, suggested they be cut. Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh has said that tariffs on consumer goods from China “serve no strategic purpose.” In addition, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a longtime critic of using tariffs to rebalance our trading relationship with China, has said that scaling back tariffs on Chinese goods is “worth considering.”
Tariffs on Chinese goods are important tools our nation must use as part of a long-term strategy in its geoeconomic competition with China. I therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to use your influence within the Biden Administration to reject the short-sighted position advocated by your colleagues. As you told Congress earlier this year, cutting tariffs would relinquish leverage at the negotiating table with China—leverage you must maintain and fully deploy, especially after China’s failure to abide by the purchase agreements it made under the Phase One trade deal. To cut tariffs at this juncture would be a strategic blunder. Not only would it reward China for its latest act of deceit, but it would give them a green light to do so again in the future.
In addition to maintaining the existing tariffs on Chinese goods, I further write to inquire about the status of a new Section 301 investigation into China’s economic practices, which includes state-directed industrial subsidies in strategically important sectors which unfairly benefit Chinese firms and degrade their American competitors. The possibility of such an investigation has been reported since at least September 2021. However, as of yet, your office has failed to act. This is unacceptable. The longer you wait to investigate and address these practices, the more damage will be done to American workers and industry. You must act with haste.
I request your written responses to the following questions no later than May 16, 2022:
1. Do you plan to reduce Section 301 tariffs on goods imported from China? If so, please explain how doing so will strengthen the United States’ long-term position in its geoeconomic competition with China.
2. Would reducing Section 301 tariffs on goods imported from China increase or decrease our nation’s trade deficit with China?
3. Why have you delayed a new Section 301 investigation into China’s economic practices, and when do you plan to initiate it?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Answers on Housing Crisis at Fort Leonard Wood
Date: Thursday, May 05, 2022

Content:
In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) pressed Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James C. McConville for answers about military housing at Fort Leonard Wood.
Last June, Senator Hawley asked the Secretary and General McConville for information about the Army’s plans to replace housing on base. Following that exchange, the Army confirmed it had allocated funding for housing at Fort Leonard Wood. More recently, however, the Army informed the Senator’s office that funding was no longer available. Concerned by the Army’s lack of progress, Senator Hawley demanded answers directly from the Army’s leaders.
Senator Hawley said, “I asked you and General McConville both last year, at this hearing, about the Army’s plans to replace aging homes at Fort Leonard Wood. You both assured me that that would be a priority. Army Materiel Command followed up with my office afterward and said that the Army would be earmarking funds for this. However, as of this week, I am not aware that the Army has allocated any funds toward replacing housing at Fort Leonard Wood – zero. So, my question is why hasn’t the Army put together a plan to replace the again housing at Fort Leonard Wood, despite agreeing that they needed to be replaced?”
He continued, “I was told last year there were $341 million that were going to be allocated towards replacing housing. Then I was told later only $50 million would be available for Fort Leonard Wood. Then I was told after that it would be zero. So you can imagine, I’m not very happy about it.”
“In Missouri, it’s a pressing issue. And when I’m told that there’s going to be funds available for housing in Missouri, and then there aren’t, I’m not happy about it. And I am not happy about getting the runaround about what it’s going to be and what it’s not going to be. And frankly, what I want to hear is that Fort Leonard Wood is going to be a priority, and that it is going to get done,”
he concluded.

Title: Hawley Bill to Dissolve DHS Disinformation Board, Disclose All Documents Related to Formation
Date: Wednesday, May 04, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Dissolving the Disinformation Governance Board Act
which would immediately dissolve the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Disinformation Governance Board and prohibit DHS from ever replicating its attempt to monitor or censor Americans’ speech.
Senator Hawley said, “Biden’s so-called Disinformation Board is unconstitutional and must be dissolved immediately. This is nothing short of a censorship committee vested with the full powers of the federal government to monitor dissenting speech and opposing viewpoints under the guise of national security. The American people need a full accounting of who signed off on this board and who approved such a radical, anti-free speech activist to lead it.”
Last week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding the board be dissolved and called for a full explanation of Nina Jankowicz’s appointment to lead it.
The
Dissolving the Disinformation Governance Board Act
will:
Dissolve the Disinformation Governance Board at DHS, effective immediately. It also removes the position of Executive Director, a role currently filled by Nina Jankowicz.
Prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from re-establishing the Board, or any similar successor entity, or authorizing substantially similar activities elsewhere in the Department.
Require the Secretary to disclose all records related to the Board in a report to Congress within 30 days. This includes all communications about the Board’s formation, the appointment of individuals to serve on the Board, and any legal review of its constitutionality.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Supreme Court Roe v Wade leak was plan to bully Justices but they must not back down
Date: Wednesday, May 04, 2022

Content:
By U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)  |  May 4, 2022  |
Fox News
I once clerked at the Supreme Court. Over the years, I’ve litigated there too, and I’ve never seen anything like the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft opinion in the abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Justice Alito’s draft majority opinion is powerful, overturning Roe and returning the question of abortion to the people. The opinion is everything a constitutionalist could hope for. This leak looks like an effort to derail it, and delegitimize the Court in the process.
[…]
And now the left is celebrating the individual who leaked this draft opinion, whoever it was. Brian Fallon, executive director of the dark-money activist group Demand Justice, theorized that a “brave clerk” was responsible for the leak, and claimed that “[a]ll Democrats need to show the same urgency.” Ian Millhiser, senior correspondent for Vox, proclaimed “shout out to whoever the hero was within the Supreme Court who said ‘f*** it! Let’s burn this place down.’” Elie Mystal, writer for the left-wing magazine The Nation, bragged that “it has at times been my literal job to try to cultivate the kind of sources who would leak this.” Tellingly, not one Democrat Senator has denounced the leak. Nor has President Joe Biden.
[…]
At the end of the day, all this left-wing talk of killing the filibuster, packing the Court, and taking to the streets amounts to the same thing: a brazen attempt to bully at least one Justice into backing down for fear of potential blowback.
[…]
No more. This time around, the Court’s majority must stay the course, and defy the left-wing pressure. In fact, the Court should issue its opinion immediately so that far-left agitators cannot try to obstruct official proceedings. The longer the Court waits, the more tricks Democrats can attempt. Justice Alito’s draft is a model of legal and historical clarity, one that devastates the false notion that a “right to abortion” is deeply rooted in our national history and tradition. Roe and Casey were wrong the day they were decided, and it’s long past time for the Court to overrule them, come what may.
Today, the American people know that a majority of the Court believes—correctly—that Roe and Casey deserve to go. Those five brave Justices cannot back down now. We are, after all, a nation of laws and not of mobs.
The Court’s very credibility, and millions of unborn lives, hang in the balance.

Title: ‘HUMAN GEYSER OF MISINFORMATION:’ Hawley Slams Head of Biden Disinformation Board, Calls for Mayorkas’ Resignation
Date: Wednesday, May 04, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about the Biden Administration’s newly formed “Disinformation Governance Board,” led by anti-free speech advocate Nina Jankowicz. Senator Hawley slammed Secretary Mayorkas for his failure to provide clear answers and called for his resignation.
During the first round of questioning, Secretary Mayorkas provided no answers as to why he hired Jankowicz, whom Senator Hawley described as “human geyser of misinformation.” Senator Hawley then called on Secretary Mayorkas to turn over all agency records related to the formation of the Board and the appointment of Jankowicz.
In the final round of questioning Secretary Mayorkas was unable to defend Jankowicz’s
blatant
partisanship
and political bias. Senator Hawley also asked Mayorkas to dissolve the Biden Administration’s disinformation board:
“Why don’t you just dissolve this board? I mean, you haven’t heard a single Senator support this board,”
said Senator Hawley. “It is an abomination, it is unconstitutional, and frankly it is embarrassing. And the fact that you’ve chosen this person to lead it is appalling.”
Senator Hawley introduced
legislation
today to dissolve the board and

Title: Dept. of Interior Approves Hawley, Blunt Request to Reinstate Police Escorts for Honor Flights
Date: Tuesday, May 03, 2022

Content:
Following a
letter
sent last week from U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the National Park Service has announced they will reinstate police escorts for American veterans traveling to Washington, D.C., as part of the Honor Flight Network. In their letter to Secretary Haaland, the Senators noted that Missouri-based Honor Flights were denied vehicular escort services this year and urged the Secretary to reverse course.
Senator Hawley said, “This is the right decision – these police escorts should have always remained in place. Our veterans are American heroes and they deserve the very best when visiting our nation’s capital.”
Senator Blunt said, “The Honor Flight program has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of veterans and their families. One of the incredible privileges of serving in Congress is being able to welcome veterans to the National Mall and thank them for their service. These memorials belong to the veterans they were built to honor. I’m glad the Department of Interior has reversed course and will resume police escorts to ensure Honor Flight travelers can get to their destinations safely and quickly. I would like to thank Honor Flight networks in Missouri and across the nation for bringing attention to this issue and working with us to get it resolved.”

The Honorable Josh Hawley
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator Hawley:
Thank you for your letter dated April 28, 2022, to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland concerning Honor Flight escorts conducted by the United States Park Police (USPP). In your letter, you requested that the USPP continue to provide law enforcement escorts for Honor Flight visits to Washington, DC. We are happy to report that earlier today, the National Park Service and the Honor Flight Network made a public announcement about their continued work together, a copy of which is enclosed.
This past Friday, leadership from the USPP and the National Mall and Memorial Parks (NAMA) met with the Honor Flight Network and shared some of our concerns. Prior to The Honor Flight Network suspending trips to DC in spring of 2020 it was increasingly difficult for USPP to consistently provide sufficient law enforcement officers to support the nearly 300 honor flight escorts each year. Historically, USPP has also escorted groups to and from all three area airports using emergency lights and sirens to expedite movement through congested traffic, a practice that is now recognized to be inconsistent with modern law enforcement best practices in non-emergency situations. In a shared commitment to a safety-first approach, the Honor Flight Network and USPP will focus law enforcement support around the National Mall and memorials area of USPP jurisdiction in Washington, DC.
Going forward, the USPP and park rangers from NAMA will meet the Honor Flight group at their chosen memorial, facilitate parking, meet with the veterans, and respond to any calls for emergency services needed by the group. Park rangers will deliver a program about any of the memorials, if desired. USPP will provide a ceremonial escort between memorials. These escorts will facilitate the safe transport of Honor Flights groups between the World War II Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the Korean War Memorial by providing temporary road closures and a law enforcement lead vehicle to guide them to each location. Ceremonial escort support will generally end at Arlington National Cemetery.
We are immeasurably grateful for the service of our veterans and humbled by the sacrifice of all who have served our country. We appreciate your strong interest in the National Park Service and for your engagement on this issue. Please know that we are committed to continuing to work with the Honor Flight Network. If you have any questions, please contact Acting USPP Chief Chris Stock at
Christopher_Stock@nps.gov
or by phone at (202) 619-7350.
A similar response is being sent to the cosigner of your letter.
Sincerely,
Carles F. Sams III

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from ATF on Anti-Gun Regulations
Date: Friday, April 29, 2022

Content:
Today Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Acting Director Gary M. Restaino demanding answers on the agency’s new rules that would unduly burden law-abiding gun owners and dealers. Senator Hawley previously sent a letter to ATF on this matter
in June 2021.
Senator Hawley asked, “What steps does ATF intend to take to ensure that any new information that may be retained by FFL dealers pursuant to Final Rule 2021R–05F is not subsequently used for the targeting of lawful gun owners by federal authorities or other politically-motivated purposes?”
ATF’s Proposed Rule 2021R–05, which has recently been finalized by ATF, would require gun dealers to maintain gun owner and transaction information forever, a dangerously close step toward an unconstitutional national gun registry.  Proposed Rule 2021R–08 would reclassify millions of pistols and AR-15-style firearms as “short-barreled rifles,” subjecting them to the rigid controls of the National Firearms Act and making it a federal felony to possess them without going through a byzantine waiver process.

Gary M. Restaino
Acting Director
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
U.S. Department of Justice
99 New York Avenue, NE
Washington, DC 20226
Dear Acting Director Restaino:
In June of 2021, I sent ATF a letter expressing concerns about two rules your office proposed that would impose substantial burdens on law-abiding firearm owners: Proposed Rule 2021R–05, Definition of “Frame or Receiver” and Identification of Firearms, and Proposed Rule 2021R–08, Factoring Criteria for Firearms With Attached “Stabilizing Braces.” I asked that ATF respond to my letter by providing additional information. Yet almost a year later, ATF still has offered no response.
That is unacceptable. Americans and their representative in Congress have a right to know what ATF is planning. The first Proposed Rule, which has now evolved into Final Rule 2021R-05F, will unsettle longstanding expectations for Americans everywhere and take steps toward a national gun registry by requiring gun dealers to maintain gun owner and transaction information forever. The second, if promulgated, would upend established practices by reclassifying millions of pistols and AR-15-style firearms as “short-barreled rifles”—thus subjecting them to the rigid controls of the National Firearms Act and making it a federal felony to possess them without going through a byzantine waiver process.  Thousands upon thousands of Americans’ rights are at stake: the Proposed Rule itself anticipates “affect[ing] upwards of 1.4 million individuals.”
Given the stakes involved, ATF’s nearly year-long delay in responding is unacceptable and has all the appearances of an attempt by a bureaucracy to evade democratic oversight. Please provide my office with responses to the following questions no later than May 22, 2022:
In the past, firearms product manufacturers have been repeatedly informed that many of the products they sell, including “receiver blanks” that have not yet been fully machined, are not considered “firearms” by ATF. Accordingly, significant reliance interests have vested. Will ATF continue to honor those prior determinations, including those pertaining to products currently on the market?
What steps does ATF intend to take to ensure that any new information that may be retained by FFL dealers pursuant to Final Rule 2021R–05F is not subsequently used for the targeting of lawful gun owners by federal authorities or other politically-motivated purposes?
What, if any, new measures does ATF anticipate taking to enforce the terms of Proposed Rule 2021R–08 against private gun owners?
Proposed Rule 2021R–08 states that it “will not have substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.” This claim stands in tension with the fact that numerous states and other jurisdictions have passed Second Amendment sanctuary laws in response to perceived federal overreach. Why were these many laws not considered relevant to a federalism analysis in the course of developing Proposed Rule 2021R–08?
What measures, if any, does ATF intend to take to attempt to enforce the terms of Proposed Rule 2021R–08 in jurisdictions subject to Second Amendment sanctuary laws?
What is ATF’s explanation for its failure to timely respond to a letter from four Senators dated June 21, 2021?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Slams Biden Administration’s ‘Disinformation Governance Board,’ Demands It Be Dissolved
Date: Thursday, April 28, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas expressing deep concern about the agency’s new Disinformation Governance Board and demanding it be dissolved. Senator Hawley cited as a particular concern DHS’s appointment of Nina Jankowicz, an anti-free speech activist with a long history of partisan attacks, to lead the board.
“I confess, I at first thought this announcement was satire. Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgment on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens. Sadly, I was mistaken. Rather than protecting our border or the American homeland, you have chosen to make policing Americans’ speech your priority,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “It can only be assumed that the sole purpose of this new Disinformation Governance Board will be to marshal the power of the federal government to censor conservative and dissenting speech. This is dangerous and un-American. The board should be immediately dissolved.”
In addition to demanding the board be dissolved, Senator Hawley requested answers to several questions about how the board will be run, who will be monitoring it, and why the DHS decided to announce the board immediately following Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

April 28, 2022
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary of Homeland Security
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
245 Murray Lane, S.W.
Washington D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
I write with deep concern about the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to create a new Disinformation Governance Board. I confess, I at first thought this announcement was satire. Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgment on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens. Sadly, I was mistaken. Rather than protecting our border or the American homeland, you have chosen to make policing Americans’ speech your priority. This new board is almost certainly unconstitutional and should be dissolved immediately.
For well over a year, your Department has consistently treated competing policy views as disinformation to be monitored or investigated. However, political debates on issues such as immigration, pandemic lockdowns, and foreign policy clearly constitute “core political speech” protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has even gone so far as to say that “Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea.” The apparent broad mandate of this new government entity to “coordinate countering misinformation” in America undermines the argument that it can even exist consistent with the Constitution.
Particularly troubling is your choice to lead the new board, Nina Jankowicz, a supposed “expert” with a long history of partisan attacks. Consider:
In 2020, she described President Trump’s use of the national guard as “a sentence I expect to hear from leaders of authoritarian countries, not the President of the United States.”
In 2021, she quoted with praise an article that said “homegrown fascism predated President Donald Trump.”
She has said America is systemically racist.
In response to revelations about Hunter Biden’s laptop, she tweeted that “50 former natsec officials and 5 former CIA heads that believe the laptop is a Russian influence op. Trump says ‘Russia, Russia, Russia.’”
Jankowicz has said the new DHS Board will “maintain the Dept’s committment [sic] to protecting free speech.” This is particularly ironic given Jankowicz’s extensive criticism of free speech and the First Amendment. Jankowicz has claimed that “the ‘free speech vs censorship’ framing is a false dichotomy.” And when Elon Musk announced his acquisition of Twitter, she said “I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities … which are already shouldering … disproportionate amounts of this abuse.” Jankowicz has even described opponents of social media speech codes as “first amendment zealots.” These statements that question the value of free speech are obviously disqualifying for such a role.
While Democrats have for years controlled the public square through their Big Tech allies, Mr. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has shown just how tenuous that control is. It can only be assumed that the sole purpose of this new Disinformation Governance Board will be to marshal the power of the federal government to censor conservative and dissenting speech. This is dangerous and un-American. The board should be immediately dissolved.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following responses prior to your expected testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on May 4, 2022:
How will this Disinformation Board function? And who exactly will it be monitoring?
What analysis did DHS conduct, if any, to ensure that the Disinformation Board and its activities comport with the First Amendment?
Why did DHS time its announcement of this governance board directly after Mr. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter?
Who appointed Ms. Jankowicz to head the board as executive director? Were you aware of her history of partisan conduct prior to her appointment?
Has DHS conferred with any private social media company in the creation or operation of this board?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

The Honor Flight Network has brought hundreds of thousands of veterans to our nation’s capital since 2005. As part of these trips, the Honor Flight Network organizes buses to bring veterans to the National Mall, where they can visit memorials for the wars in which they fought, reflect on the sacrifices they and their comrades made in those campaigns, and remember those who never came home. To say that the Honor Flight Network is performing a national service is an understatement. For thousands of American veterans, these trips are a once in a lifetime opportunity for honor, reflection, and remembrance that simply cannot be replaced.
The Department of the Interior has historically played an important role in making these trips possible by providing U.S. Park Police escorts for buses carrying Honor Flight veterans to the National Mall. These escorts are important because of many of these veterans are no longer able to walk long distances on their own. Being able to drive and park close to the memorials they are visiting is therefore essential. Escorts also help to ensure Honor Flight trips are safe and run smoothly without logistical challenges or schedule delays that can impact the trip’s experience for our veterans.
Yet it appears the Department of the Interior has changed its policy about providing these vehicular escorts for Honor Flight trips. For example, in response to an inquiry from Rep. Bill Posey (FL), the Chief of the U.S. Park Police admitted that there had been a “suspension” of these services in part due to the Department’s “policy on escorts.” In addition, we have recently been made aware that Missouri-based Honor Flights have been denied these vehicular services, even though they have received these same services in years past.
Such a policy change is wholly unacceptable and deserves further explanation. It needlessly creates new challenges for Honor Flight groups, including veterans from our home state of Missouri.
Our nation’s veterans represent the best of us. It’s critical that the government do its part to honor their sacrifices by making these trips run as smoothly as possible. With this in mind, we urge you in the strongest possible terms to resume U.S. Park Police escorts for veterans traveling to our nation’s capital with the Honor Flight Network. We ask further for your responses to the following questions no later than Tuesday, May 3, 2022:
1. How many police escorts has the Department of the Interior provided annually for Honor Flight Network trips to Washington, DC? Please provide all relevant data annualized for the years 2005 to 2022.
2. When did the Department of the Interior formally decide to suspend police escorts for Honor Flight trips to Washington, D.C., and why was this decision made?
3. Why does the Department now claim its “policy on escorts” prohibits vehicular services to the Honor Flight Network, when these same services were provided in years past?
4. Were the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of Veterans Affairs informed of any decision by the Department of the Interior to end police escorts for Honor Flight trips, and if so, when were they informed, and did they support that decision?
5. Will you commit to provide police escorts for all future Honor Flight trips to our nation’s capital? If so, when will those escorts become available and who should the Honor Flight Network contact in order to coordinate trip escorts?
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We await your timely response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Calls for Public Audit of Past Twitter Censorship
Date: Wednesday, April 27, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, calling for a comprehensive public audit of Twitter’s past censorship practices.
Senator Hawley writes,
“In recent years, Twitter has intervened in American discourse with an increasingly heavy hand, attempting to shape the information environment for overtly partisan reasons. Algorithms didn’t make those calls; employees did. And at this point, the American people deserve to know the truth about what went on at Twitter for years behind closed doors.”
He continues, “A public audit like this will prove essential, as you start to rebuild a culture of free speech and open discourse at Twitter, to determining where exactly things went wrong on the platform and who is principally responsible.”
In April 2019, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
calling on former CEO Jack Dorsey to conduct a similar audit of Twitter’s suspension policies.
Read the full text of the letter
here
or below:
Mr. Elon Musk
c/o Tesla Motors
13101 Harold Green Road
Austin, TX 78725
Dear Mr. Musk:
Congratulations on your acquisition of Twitter. Your commitment to free speech is rare in the world of social media, and I am hopeful you will indeed help Twitter become a platform that values and protects it.
There’s certainly a lot of work to be done. Twitter has largely evaded public accountability over the past several years. Since I’ve been in the Senate, I’ve sent a number of oversight inquiries to the company. These letters cover subjects as diverse as content moderation policies, viewpoint discrimination, suppression of content, and Twitter’s own security. Twitter, not surprisingly, has effectively ignored these requests.
But perhaps most importantly, all the way back in 2019 I sent a letter to Twitter urging the company to “conduct a third-party audit and release the results to the public, in full.”
Now you have the chance to make that kind of audit a reality. In recent years, Twitter has intervened in American discourse with an increasingly heavy hand, attempting to shape the information environment for overtly partisan reasons. Algorithms didn’t make those calls; employees did. And at this point, the American people deserve to know the truth about what went on at Twitter for years behind closed doors.
Some particularly salient questions to investigate in the audit include the following:
Who was responsible for deliberately suppressing the New York Post’s now-vindicated reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop and business dealings?
How many Twitter users have had their accounts suspended, and why?
How many Twitter users have been shadowbanned, and why?
Do Twitter’s shadowbanning and suspension patterns evince a consistent political bias?
Have Twitter employees, since news of your acquisition of the platform became public, made changes to the platform or deleted records of their time at the service?
A public audit like this will prove essential, as you start to rebuild a culture of free speech and open discourse at Twitter, to determining where exactly things went wrong on the platform and who is principally responsible.
No doubt the results will be illuminating for all of us.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley Slams Gmail’s Bias Against Republican Candidates, Demands Answers From Google
Date: Wednesday, April 27, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, demanding explanations for a recent academic study finding filtering that Gmail’s spam filtering algorithm was significantly more likely to mark Republican fundraising emails as spam than Democrat fundraising emails. The letter comes amid ongoing debates over free speech around the sale of tech giant Twitter and censorship issues that have persisted in the tech industry for years.
In his letter to Google,
Senator Hawley wrote, “While 90% of emails from Democratic politicians reached their intended recipients, the number for Republican candidates was only 23% at worst. Even worse, Google’s bias against Republican candidates becomes more pronounced as an election gets closer. […] The study found that Gmail treats Democratic emails much more favorably than Republican emails even though the content of the emails was substantially similar. In other words, Gmail marked emails as spam because of the ‘political affiliation of the sender,’ not because of the content of the email.”
He continued, “Google’s market power across so many sectors of the internet provides it with an unprecedented ability to control what messages ultimately get out. Accordingly, your company should take immediate corrective action in response to these findings. […]  Google’s algorithm should not be dictating the ‘outcomes of an election.’ Preserving the integrity of the 2022 elections demands no less.”
Senator Hawley requested Google explain this pattern of bias and asked for answers to several additional questions, including what steps Google is taking to review its filtering algorithms for implicit or explicit political bias and why the bias against Republicans increases as an election draws nearer.
Senator Hawley has
long been critical
of big tech companies, including their
censorship
of users and
monopoly power. On the recent sale of Twitter, he noted it would be a major change if Elon Musk returned the company to its original
free speech
commitments. Last night Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Musk calling for a comprehensive public audit of Twitter’s past censorship practices.
Read the full letter to Google
here
or below.
Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google, LLC
1600 Amphitheater Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
The health of our democratic republic depends on voter engagement. And as more and more of our everyday communication shifts online, it’s vital that political campaigns can reliably reach their supporters, particularly in the runup to the 2022 elections. But new research reveals that your company makes it much harder for Republicans to reach their supporters even while your company makes it very easy for Democrats to reach theirs.
A team of researchers at North Carolina State University uncovered a disturbing pattern of political bias in the spam filtering algorithms used by Gmail. The study reported that “all [spam filtering algorithms] exhibited political biases in the months leading up to the 2020 US elections” but that Google’s bias was substantially worse than any other major provider. While Microsoft’s spam algorithm favored one party by 20% and Yahoo’s algorithm favored one party by 14%, Google’s algorithm favored Democrats by an astonishing 59%. While 90% of emails from Democratic politicians reached their intended recipients, the number for Republican candidates was only 23% at worst. Even worse, Google’s bias against Republican candidates becomes more pronounced as an election gets closer.
And critically, the researchers noted that there was no reason to think one party was sending out “spammier” emails than the other. The study found that Gmail treats Democratic emails much more favorably than Republican emails even though the content of the emails was substantially similar. In other words, Gmail marked emails as spam because of the “political affiliation of the sender,” not because of the content of the email. As the researchers put it, this is “rather worrying” because it reveals that Google’s algorithm can alter the “outcomes of an election.”
I am particularly alarmed by this pattern because political dice-loading is nothing new for your company. Back in 2020, in partnership with the dark-money “Center for Countering Digital Hate,” your company abruptly threatened to remove the conservative website The Federalist from the Google Ads platform, based on the contents of its comments section. YouTube routinely deplatforms or demonetizes individuals because of their conservative speech. And a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google manually adjusts its algorithm and autocomplete suggestions to disfavor certain viewpoints.
In response to the North Carolina study, your company has stated that “[m]ail classifications in Gmail automatically adjust to match Gmail users’ preferences and actions.” In other words, the only reason these emails are being flagged as spam is that Gmail users tend to treat them as such.  The NCSU research team anticipated this possibility and refuted it. Even controlling for that possibility, Google still has a noticeable, substantial bias. The researchers even stated outright that they “did not find any consistent actions that one could recommend to users to help them reduce the bias in the way the [spam filtering algorithm] treats political emails that are sent to them.” Something else, in short, explains the disparity. That something else, the study concluded, is the “political affiliation of the sender.”
Google’s market power across so many sectors of the internet provides it with an unprecedented ability to control what messages ultimately get out. Accordingly, your company should take immediate corrective action in response to these findings. As the authors of the NCSU study stated, “[i]t is imperative for the email services to audit their [spam filtering algorithms] to ensure that any properties of the sender that they consider in determining whether any given email is spam or not are not, unknowingly, putting one side at an advantage compared to the other.” Google’s algorithm should not be dictating the “outcomes of an election.” Preserving the integrity of the 2022 elections demands no less.
Moreover, please provide my office with answers to the following questions at your earliest convenience:
What is Google’s explanation for this pattern of bias?
If “user behavior” is the driving factor, how could the researchers conclude otherwise?
Why, in Google’s view, is Gmail’s filtering algorithm bias so much more pronounced than Outlook and Yahoo’s bias?
Why does the bias against Republicans increase as an election draws nearer?
What steps is Google taking in the wake of this study to review its filtering algorithms for implicit or explicit political bias?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Blunt to Introduce Resolution Honoring the Lives of Fallen Missouri Police Officers
Date: Monday, April 25, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) will introduce a resolution in honor of three Missouri Police Officers who were killed in the line of duty in
March. Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, and Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department lost their lives in service to their communities.
“The loss of Corporal Cooper, Officer Reed, and Patrolman Burns is a tragedy and their heroic actions will not be forgotten”
said Senator Hawley. “I thank the brave men and women who wear blue across our state. They selflessly risk their lives every day for our safety.“
“Every time a law enforcement officer reports for their shift, neither they nor their families know what dangerous situations they may face,”
said Senator Blunt. “Law enforcement officers’ selfless dedication is a powerful testament to their courage and character. In recent weeks, three of Missouri’s finest lost their lives in the line of duty. Joplin Police Corporal Benjamin Cooper, Joplin Police Officer Jake Reed, and Bonne Terre Police Officer Lane Burns did not hesitate to put the safety of others ahead of their own. We are grateful they answered the call to serve and we owe a deep debt of gratitude to their families.”
Text of the resolution can be found
here
and below.
Title: Honoring the lives of fallen Missouri police officers and expressing condolences to their families.
Whereas police officers, sheriffs and deputies, and other law enforcement officers serve and protect their communities with honor and sacrifice;
Whereas all individuals in law enforcement put their lives on the line while serving and protecting their local communities;
Whereas when violent crime increases, law enforcement officers and the communities they serve are directly impacted;
Whereas, in the month of March 2022, Missouri experienced violent attacks against police officers, especially in rural areas;
Whereas, in a 20-day period, 6 police officers in Missouri were shot in the line of duty, 3 of whom suffered injuries that were fatal; and
Whereas these fallen officers include—
1.  Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 8, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody;
2.  Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, who passed away from injuries sustained in the line of duty on March 11, 2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody; and
3.  Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department, who passed away in the line of duty on March 17, 2022, after responding to a disturbance: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
expresses deep condolences for the Missouri police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty;
recognizes the countless selfless and heroic actions carried out by local law enforcement officers;
expresses strong support for police officers and law enforcement officers in rural areas and across the United States that serve and protect their local communities;
recognizes the need to ensure that rural law enforcement departments have the proper equipment, training, and resources necessary to protect officers and the individuals in the communities they serve;
acknowledges the importance of honoring and remembering fallen police and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty; and
expresses condolences to the loved ones of each law enforcement officer across the United States who has made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty and whose sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Title: Hawley Introduces the Taiwan Weapons Exports Act
Date: Thursday, April 07, 2022

Content:
Today Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Taiwan Weapons Exports Act,
which would fast-track delivery of critical weapons to Taiwan by expediting Congressional approval and eliminating administrative roadblocks.
The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is growing rapidly. Critical to deterring such an invasion is ensuring Taiwan has the weapons it needs to defend itself, including naval mines, anti-tank missiles, man-portable air defense systems, and other asymmetric defense capabilities. This legislation would help the United States get these weapons to Taiwan as quickly as possible.
“The Biden administration waited for Russia to invade before surging lethal aid to Ukraine,”
Senator Hawley sai
d. “We can’t afford to the make same mistake in the Indo-Pacific. That’s why it is so important to fast-track weapons to Taiwan now, while Taiwan still has to time to marshal its defenses and deter a Chinese invasion.”
The
Taiwan Weapons Exports Act
would:
Redesignate Taiwan as a member of Country Group A:5 under the Export Administration Regulations alongside other U.S. allies and partners, including NATO member states, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and India.
Expedite licensing approval and remove other administrative barriers for arms sales to Taiwan.
Reduce the length of Congressional review of arms sales to Taiwan by half.
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Hawley has led efforts to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations. Key legislative initiatives include the
Arm Taiwan Act of 2021, which creates a new Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of critical asymmetric defense capabilities.
Senator Hawley has also introduced two other critical pieces of Taiwan-related legislation: the
Taiwan Defense Act, which would require the U.S. Department of Defense to prioritize strengthening deterrence by ensuring American forces maintain their ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and the
Taiwan Preclearance Act, which affirms Taiwan’s role as a critical partner in the pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific and establishes U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance facilities in Taiwan as a way to increase U.S. Taiwan business, cultural, and tourism exchanges.

Title: Senator Hawley Urges Commerce Committee to Adopt Enhanced Duck Boat Safety Measures in 2022 Coast Guard Reauthorization
Date: Thursday, April 07, 2022

Content:
Following
new updates
in the case of the tragic duck boat accident on Table Rock Lake in Branson, Mo., in 2018, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
new letter
today to the Senate Commerce Committee highlighting the need to include enhanced duck boat safety measures in the 2022 Coast Guard reauthorization, which is currently pending in the committee.
Sen. Hawley, who was Attorney General of Missouri at the time of the tragic duck boat accident on Table Rock Lake, has followed the issue extensively in the Senate. In addition to
urging
the Coast Guard to adopt updated NTSB safety recommendations for amphibious vessels, he led the Senate’s bipartisan passage of his “
Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act
” in November 2020.
“Since that time, the findings and recommendations in my legislation have only been further confirmed,”
Sen. Hawley wrote. “Most recently, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee advanced similar provisions in Title III, Section 305 of the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022. And last week, these provisions passed in the House of Representatives and were sent to the Senate for consideration.”
Sen. Hawley
reintroduced
his duck boat safety legislation this Congress in January 2021. It is currently
cosponsored
by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
He concluded, “As you consider the House-passed legislation and commence work on the reauthorization of the Coast Guard in your committee, I urge you to support and advance the provisions in my legislation codifying new safety requirements for duck boats. Congress must not delay any longer and must act to honor the lives lost by passing strong new safety and security measures for duck boats. This legislation must be enacted into law.”

The Honorable Maria Cantwell
Chair
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Roger Wicker
Ranking Member
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker:
I urge you to ensure critical safety requirements for DUKW Amphibious Passenger Vessels, commonly known as “duck boats”, are included in the 2022 U.S. Coast Guard Reauthorization, which may soon be considered by the U.S. Senate.
Many in my home state of Missouri and across the country will remember July 19, 2018, as the tragic day that 17 people lost their lives and several more were injured in a boating accident on Table Rock Lake. During a severe thunderstorm, a duck boat called Stretch Duck 7 sank with 31 people on board, including children. Congress must honor the victims who have lost their lives in this accident and ensure it never happens again by passing comprehensive, common sense safety measures on every duck boat operation in America.
The tragedy in Missouri may have been the most recent loss of life involving a Duck Boat, but it was far from the first. In 1999, 13 people died when a duck boat sank in Lake Hamilton in Arkansas. In the years since, the death toll has climbed to over 40. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued numerous safety recommendations, some of them repeatedly. [
1
] The U.S. Coast Guard has concurred with some of those recommendations, and most recently the National Academies of Sciences has further emphasized the need for new Coast Guard rules, such as those in my legislation, S. 62, Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act of 2021. [
2
]
Strong new safety recommendations for duck boats have bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. In the 116th Congress, my bill codifying the NTSB’s recommendations passed your committee unanimously with your support and subsequently passed the Senate by unanimous consent on December 20, 2020.
Since that time, the findings and recommendations in my legislation have only been further confirmed and reinforced, such as through a study by the National Academies of Sciences. Most recently, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee advanced similar provisions in Title III, Section 305 of the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022. And last week, these provisions passed in the House of Representatives and were sent to the Senate for consideration.
As you consider the House-passed legislation and commence work on the reauthorization of the Coast Guard in your committee, I urge you to support and advance the provisions in my legislation codifying new safety requirements for duck boats. Congress must not delay any longer and must act to honor the lives lost by passing strong new safety and security measures for duck boats. This legislation must be enacted into law.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Rips Biden Admin over DHS Plans to Rescind Title 42, Allocate Veteran Resources to Illegal Immigrants
Date: Wednesday, April 06, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a new letter
to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, expressing deep concern with the administration’s decision to rescind the Title 42 order amid an ongoing humanitarian crisis – with numbers
surging
– at the southern border. Senator Hawley also inquired about disturbing new reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has plans to divert resources from veterans to provide free services for illegal immigrants.
“Rather than enforce our immigration laws, the Biden Administration has repeatedly changed existing policy to encourage, facilitate, and obscure illegal immigration. President Biden
halted construction
of the border wall,
reinforced DACA, and
limited ICE enforcement actions. He has also illegally reversed the Trump Administration’s Remain in Mexico Policy. Most recently, the Biden Administration announced its
plan to rescind
its Title 42 policy,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
“This has led to reports that the annual spring surge of illegal immigration will be even worse than usual. In the
words of one CBP agent, ‘We are expecting to get wrecked.’”
He continued,
“I am particularly alarmed at new reports suggesting that DHS plans to
divert doctors
from the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide free medical resources to those crossing our border illegally.”
Senator Hawley went on to highlight new reports that
DHS plans to provide
migrants with free phones, as well as
alleged plans
“to maximize the ability of illegal immigrants to apply for relief.”
He outlined a list of questions for Secretary Mayorkas, with a deadline of April 29, 2022, to respond.

or below.
April 6, 2022
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary of Homeland Security
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
245 Murray Lane, S.W.
Washington D.C. 20528
Secretary Mayorkas:
I write with concern at the coming surge of illegal immigration this spring. The Biden Administration has announced that it intends to rescind its Title 42 order, which will only exacerbate the crisis at the southern border. At the same time, new reports and leaked documents suggest that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to divert resources from our veterans so that it can provide free services to illegal immigrants. These reports demand answers.
We have a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. In 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported over two million encounters with aliens illegally crossing the southern border—the highest number ever recorded. [
1
] One Arizona sector has experienced a 579% increase over the last fiscal year. [
2
] More than 62,000 illegal immigrants evaded Border Patrol agents in March. [
3
] What is more, some of the immigrants that CBP has caught have been identified as previously deported MS-13 gang members. [
4
]
Rather than enforce our immigration laws, the Biden Administration has repeatedly changed existing policy to encourage, facilitate, and obscure illegal immigration. President Biden halted construction of the border wall, [
5
] reinforced DACA, [
6
] and limited ICE enforcement actions. [
7
] He has also illegally reversed the Trump Administration’s Remain in Mexico Policy—which is set to be argued before the Supreme Court later this month.
Most recently, the Biden Administration announced its plan to rescind its Title 42 policy, prohibiting entry into the country of individuals carrying communicable diseases. [
8
] This disastrous policy decision has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, Sen. Kelly called this “the wrong decision,” while Sen. Sinema said that such an action shows a “lack of understanding about the crisis at the border.” [
9
] Sen. Manchin has said that, “Today’s announcement by the CDC and the Biden Administration is a frightening decision. Title 42 has been an essential tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19 and controlling the influx of migrants at our southern border.” [
10
] Sen. Hassan has warned that, “Ending Title 42 prematurely will likely lead to a migrant surge that the administration does not appear to be ready for.” [
11
]
This has led to reports that the annual spring surge of illegal immigration will be even worse than usual. In the words of one CBP agent, “We are expecting to get wrecked.” [
12
] Even the Washington Post acknowledges that “[t]he predictable effect of lifting Title 42 is a new influx of migrants from Central America and beyond, which would compound an existing surge at the U.S.-Mexican border.” [
13
] The Editorial Board correctly notes that this “was supposed to be Vice President Harris’s brief, but she appears to have done little to address the problem.” [
14
] Instead, we must brace for “chaos at the border.” [
15
]
I am particularly alarmed at new reports suggesting that DHS plans to divert doctors from the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide free medical resources to those crossing our border illegally. In the words of one CBP official, “We’re going to take medical services away from people that really deserve that. Who went to combat… to give free medical attention to illegal migrants.” [
16
]
There are also reports that DHS plans to provide migrants with free phones. [
17
] In addition, a leaked memorandum titled “DHS Southwest Border Mass Irregular Contingency Plan” details your plan to maximize the ability of illegal immigrants to apply for relief. [
18
]
These new reports deserve immediate answers. They should be confirmed or denied promptly. So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by April 29, 2022:
Does DHS plan to divert medical resources from the Department of Veteran Affairs to provide free medical services to illegal aliens?
Does DHS plan to provide illegal aliens with free phones? What is the justification for doing so?
If cell phones are being provided to illegal aliens, what controls are in place to ensure taxpayer dollars do not go to waste?
Please produce a complete and unredacted copy of the Department’s memorandum titled “Southwest Border Mass Irregular Migration Contingency Plan.”
What steps are you taking to combat the expected surge in illegal immigration at the southern border?
How many encounters with illegal aliens does the Department expect this spring, compared to last spring?
How many more Border Patrol agents does the Department plan to hire to address the crisis at the southern border?
By what objective metrics is the Department measuring its performance?
How is the Department leveraging drones and other technologies to monitor at the southern border?
How is the Department partnering with state and local officials to address the crisis at the southern border?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Democrats Block Hawley Bill to Get Tough on Child Sex Offenders
Date: Tuesday, April 05, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) went to the Senate Floor today to call for unanimous consent to pass his
PROTECT Act of 2022, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) objected and blocked the bill from passing.
Senator Hawley said, “Child sex trafficking is an exploding epidemic in my state, and around our country. Children are exploited, children are trafficked and those who work in this area, those who prosecute in this area, law enforcement who work day in and day out will tell you that the explosion of child pornography is helping to drive this exploding epidemic of child exploitation and child sex trafficking.”
“The fact that the Senate hasn’t acted until now, is, I think, is shameful for the Senate. But why wait another day? […] I am not willing to sit by and tell the parents of my state that I did nothing. I am not willing to dismiss child exploitation as just some conspiracy theory. I am not willing to abandon the victims of this crime,”
Senator Hawley continued following Durbin’s objection.
Senator Durbin, who rebutted, criticized Senator Hawley’s decision to call for a vote after recently introducing the bill in the Senate. “Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois says that Congress hasn’t acted in two decades, that’s true. I haven’t been here for two decades, he has,”
replied Senator Hawley.
Senator Durbin, with support from Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.), passed
similar legislation
in 2003. The
PROTECT Act worked. But the Supreme Court gutted it in 2005, in a controversial 5-4 decision called United States v. Booker, allowing judges like Ketanji Brown Jackson the ability to impose
lenient sentences
on child porn offenders.
The
PROTECT ACT of 2022
would create a new mandatory minimum sentence of five years for every child porn offender who possesses pornography, and prohibit judges from sentencing below the Guidelines range for facts found during trial or admitted by the defendant. This change will ensure that judges impose tougher sentences on child pornography offenders.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered his closing statement in the Senate Judiciary Markup for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination.
In his closing statement, Senator Hawley reinforced his stance against Judge Jackson’s record for
lenient sentencing for pedophiles, and continued to express his opposition to her nomination. Judge Jackson
refused to respond
when asked about her sentencing record in various child pornography cases during her confirmation hearings.
Senator Hawley said, “We’ve heard in Judge Jackson’s defense, and I don’t know if it’s really much of a defense – I know she didn’t say these things – but in her defense, by the White House and members of this committee, we’ve been told things like ‘child pornography is actually all a conspiracy, it’s not real, it’s just a conspiracy, it’s made up.’ Let me just say for the record, sex crimes against children are not fiction. They are not a conspiracy.”
He continued, “There are 85 million images of children being exploited available on the internet. I’m a former prosecutor. These are real crimes. I’m a father of three young children. These are real children. And these aren’t victimless crimes. Just because they’re images doesn’t mean real kids aren’t involved. As we heard testimony from prosecutors and experts just two weeks ago, child pornography creates a cycle of trafficking, of exploitation, of abuse. It is the children here who are the victims, not the criminals. On that core point, I disagree fundamentally with Judge Jackson. I wish her well, but I cannot support her nomination.”
In response to the growing epidemic of child pornography in the United States,
Senator Hawley
introduced the
PROTECT Act of 2022,
which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and by preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines.

Title: Hawley Leads Bill to Protect Children, Toughen Sentences for Child Porn Offenders
Date: Tuesday, March 29, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
PROTECT Act of 2022, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and by preventing judges from sentencing offenders below federal guidelines. The bill is co-sponsored by Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). Representative Ken Buck (CO-4) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
The epidemic of child pornography in the United States is growing exponentially. Just over a decade ago, the number of images of child sexual abuse material online was less than 1 million. That number grew to 45 million
in 2018, and to 85 million
in 2021.
By federal statute, judges are required to sentence criminals within ranges set by the federal “Sentencing Guidelines,” subject to some exceptions. In 2003, Congress passed the original
PROTECT Act
to curtail the exceptions—and enhance the penalties—in child pornography cases.
The PROTECT Act
worked. But the Supreme Court gutted it in 2005, in
United States v. Booker, a controversial 5-4 decision. Since then, some federal judges like
Ketanji Brown Jackson
have used their discretion to
impose
lenient sentences
on child porn offenders. Sen. Hawley’s bill would prevent judges from doing so in the future.
“The horror of child pornography is exponentially worse than it was a decade ago, and judges handing out lenient sentences for these criminals is a big reason why,”
said Senator Hawley. “While the White House continues to dismiss concerns about leniency toward child porn offenders as a ‘desperate conspiracy theory,’ the numbers speak for themselves. Congress must act before this problem becomes even worse.”
Representative Buck said, “The confirmation hearings of Biden’s Supreme Court nominee have exposed a troubling leniency on the left and, most surprisingly, on the right for those who commit sexual offenses against children.  It’s time for Congress to stand with the victims of these offenses, and to ensure that perpetrators receive the severe punishment these crimes deserve.”
Senator Lee said, “Those who view and share Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) fuel demand for the sexual abuse of children.  Last week’s hearings showed that activist judges will not do their job unless Congress mandates minimum sentences for these violent crimes.  This bill would make the law in this area crystal clear: if you view or share CSAM, you’ll go to prison for a very long time.”
Senator Scott said, “Our communities must be protected from sick individuals who exploit and victimize children, and also from liberal activist judges who abuse their sentencing discretion to let offenders off the hook. Federal sentencing guidelines for these heinous crimes are critical and I am proud to support this good bill to ensure guidelines are strictly enforced.”
Senator Tillis said, “There is bipartisan consensus that Congress must act to ensure we impose strong penalties on people in possession of child pornography. The PROTECT Act will protect our children and ensure sexual predators receive the appropriate sentence for receiving or possessing child pornography.”
The
PROTECT Act of 2022
would:
Enhance the penalties for possessing child pornography.
Federal law imposes a 5-year mandatory-minimum for receiving child pornography but not for possessing it. There is no meaningful difference between possession and receipt. This change will align the penalties and apply a 5-year mandatory minimum to both offenses to ensure that every child pornography offender goes to jail.
Make the Guidelines binding again.
The Supreme Court declared in United States v. Booker that the Guidelines cannot be binding if based on facts found by a judge after trial. This bill would prohibit judges from sentencing below the Guidelines range for facts found during trial or admitted by the defendant. This change will ensure that judges impose tougher sentences on child pornography offenders.

Title: WaPo: Child Porn Offender KBJ Sentenced To Just 3 Months Continued Searching Pictures of Children
Date: Thursday, March 24, 2022

Content:
At this week’s Supreme Court hearings, U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson about
her statements
in
U.S. v. Hawkins
where she sentenced a child porn offender to just three months instead of the recommended eight to 10 years. After his release, he continued seeking out “sexually arousing” images of young children.
The Washington Post
reports
:
A person familiar with the Hawkins case read to The Post the probation office request that led to Jackson’s order. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to publicly discuss it.
The probation office petition did not allege that Hawkins committed any new sexual offense or violation of conditions. However, it stated that “despite being in treatment for more than five years,”
Hawkins “continues to seek out sexually arousing, non-pornographic material and images of males 13 to 16-years-old.”
The petition asked Jackson to order closer supervision to reduce the risk of recidivism and help Hawkins regain independent function.

Title: Senator Hawley Questions Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson Over Troubling Record of Lenient Sentencing for Pedophiles
Date: Wednesday, March 23, 2022

During the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination for U.S. Supreme Court today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) focused his questioning on the alarming trend of lenient sentencing in child pornography cases that he first mentioned in a
tweet thread
last week and his
opening comments
yesterday.
During his time, Sen. Hawley focused on Judge Jackson’s sentencing decision and comments during one of the seven child pornography cases he was concerned about,
United States v. Hawkins, in which Judge Jackson sentenced the offender, age 18, to a significantly lower sentence than what the federal sentencing guidelines and prosecutor had recommended: just three months in prison.

Title: When Pressed by Sen. Hawley on Her Lenient Record, Judge Jackson Can’t Respond
Date: Wednesday, March 23, 2022

Content:
Building on his questioning during
yesterday’s Supreme Court hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson today on her sentencing record in various child pornography cases. When asked again about
United States v. Hawkins, Judge Jackson would not say if she regretted her decision to sentence the defendant to just three months in prison, then refused to engage on several of Senator Hawley’s questions about the thought process behind her decision not to give more severe sentences for criminals based on the amount of child pornography in their possession.
From their conversation:
Senator Hawley said,
“I’m asking you if you regret the sentence in this case, and it sounds like the answer is no. I regret it. Let me read what you said about these kinds of cases. ‘Some of the children you saw in those pictures will never have a normal adult relationship. Some will turn to drugs and prostitution and other vices to try to deal emotionally with the pain that results for the torture they have experiences… Some people are even unable to leave their houses because once those pictures are on the internet, they are there forever. The victims can’t do anything without worrying that every person they meet has seen them in their most vulnerable state at the most horrible time in their lives.’ Those are your words. Powerful words. I just don’t understand why after saying this, you could give this guy three months in prison when the probation officer that we have heard so much about recommended eighteen months. Do you have anything to add?”
Judge Jackson responded, “No, Senator.”

Title: Hawley Refutes ‘Fact Check’ on Judge Jackson’s Record of Lenient Sentencing for Pedophiles
Date: Friday, March 18, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following
statement
in response to a “fact check” from the Washington Post on his
Twitter thread
exposing Judge Jackson’s leniency on child porn offenders:
“Judge Jackson has yet to address her alarming record on child porn offenders. But rather than ask her questions, the Washington Post is regurgitating White House talking points. Their ‘fact check’ questions & my answers below. Now go ask the person nominated for the Supreme Court.”
WASHINGTON POST QUESTION 1:
Hawley:
No. Judge Jackson’s words are right there in print, and they speak for themselves. When she does quote from or refer to previous testimony, she does so with approval and indicates the witness has changed her mind on child porn offenders.
Judge Jackson said she found the “category of nonsexually motivated child pornography offenders” to be “just so interesting.”
Judge Jackson theorized there “could be a less-serious child pornography offender” whose “motivation is the challenge” while “they aren’t necessarily that interested in the child pornography piece of it.”
Judge Jackson said she had “mistakingly [sic.] assumed that child pornography offenders are pedophiles” and wanted to “understand this category of nonpedophiles who obtain child pornography”
WASHINGTON POST QUESTION 2:
Hawley:
Judge Jackson recommended eliminating the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for child porn. It’s right there in the report. As for the other Commissioners who supported this bad recommendation, they probably shouldn’t be on the Supreme Court either.
WASHINGTON POST QUESTION 3:
Hawley
:
Forget the maximum guideline, Judge Jackson went below the maximum, the minimum, and below what the government requested in every single case for which we can find records, except two. In those two the law required her to impose the sentence the government recommended.
As to the idea we ought to go soft on child porn offenders, you might want to have a look at the exploding severity of child porn usage. A
2019 New York Times report
found 45 million images of child pornography that year, more than double from the previous year, and up from less than a million a decade ago. Critics of the child pornography guidelines made their criticisms before these numbers were reported. This is not the time to go soft on sex offenses against children.

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill to Strengthen Investigations of Fraud in COVID-19 Relief Programs
Date: Thursday, March 17, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced new legislation today to continue to fund and restore the jurisdiction of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) so that it can investigate fraud within the Treasury Department’s pandemic programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This anti-fraud legislation comes as the Biden Administration is lobbying for more federal dollars for COVID-19.
SIGPR was created by the CARES Act in 2020 to conduct oversight and investigate fraud into the unprecedented amounts of federal funds dispersed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of lawmakers, including Senator Hawley, have referred fraud allegations to SIGPR, which has proved it can be an effective and important watchdog for preventing fraud of taxpayer dollars in federal pandemic programs.
However, the Biden Administration has
stripped
SIGPR of its jurisdiction and attempted to undermine its authority. SIGPR also faces issues with
underfunding
which will impact its operations.
Senator Hawley said, “Congress has appropriated an enormous amount of federal aid for COVID-19 programs. The last thing the Biden Administration should do is undermine an independent watchdog and strip this office of its ability to investigate fraud in programs that use millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars.”
Today in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on pandemic response, Senator Hawley blasted the Biden Administration for gutting pandemic fraud oversight.
The anti-fraud legislation will
:
Restore SIGPR’s jurisdiction to investigate fraud over all of pandemic-related Treasury programs. This abrogates the Biden Administration’s legal opinion last April stripping SIGPR of jurisdiction over the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and other programs.
Provide emergency appropriations of $25 million per year for the next three years. This would prevent SIGPR from shutting down before its congressional mandate is complete.

Title: Hawley Demands Open Hearings on U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan Following Eye-Opening CENTCOM Report
Date: Wednesday, March 16, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-RI), urging him to convene open hearings on our withdrawal from Afghanistan following U.S. Central Command’s report exposing the full extent of the Biden Administration failure to prepare for and respond to the rapid collapse of the Afghan government.
In yesterday’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing,
Senator Hawley questioned
Marine Corps General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., Commander of U.S. Central Command, on Central Command’s 2,000-page investigative report into the explosion at Abbey Gate and related events. Senator Hawley asked Gen. McKenzie specifically about the report’s findings that the Administration ignored warnings about the Afghan government’s rapid collapse and delayed planning for evacuating Americans until it was too late.
Senator Hawley’s new letter to Chairman Reed explains,
“The American public wants and deserves accountability for what transpired in Afghanistan last year, and this report is an important step in that direction. Yet the Armed Services Committee has ignored it since its release. Members of this Committee appear to be either unfamiliar or misinformed about its contents. Just yesterday morning, for instance, one Senator said it was ‘categorically untrue’ that the Biden administration had months of warning that the Afghan government might collapse rapidly. This is wrong. As the Central Command report and other sources show, multiple commanders of U.S. forces in Afghanistan advised the Administration in the spring and summer of 2021 to prepare for the rapid collapse of the Afghan government. But the Administration ignored them.”
He continued,
“A rigorous and public review of the Central Command investigative report is the necessary and appropriate next step to ensure accountability for the disaster in Afghanistan and prevent another like it. I am aware that Congress has directed an outside commission to study our decades-long engagement in Afghanistan. But that look-back, which may take years to complete and will not focus on the events detailed in the Central Command report, is no substitute for actual congressional oversight.”
Senator Hawley has repeatedly called for
open hearings
and
accountability
on Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal.

or below.
Honorable Jack Reed Chairman
Committee on Armed Services United States Senate
228 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510-6050
Dear Chairman Reed,
I write to urge you to promptly convene open hearings on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan following the report of U.S. Central Command.
It is no secret that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was poorly planned and executed. Only now, however, is the full extent of this tragedy coming to light as a result of U.S. Central Command’s investigation into the events surrounding the Abbey Gate bombing on August 26, 2021. Drawing on interviews with 139 individuals, including U.S. military commanders on the ground, the investigation reveals in new detail just how badly the Biden administration failed to prepare for and then respond to the rapid collapse of the Afghan government.
The investigative report’s findings and underlying testimony reaffirm, for instance, that the Administration had ample warning that such a rapid collapse was possible if not likely. The report shows further how key parts of the Administration refused to prepare for that eventuality, despite mounting warnings and at the cost of American forces’ ability to begin preparing the battlespace for a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO), including by establishing security at the Kabul airport. And the report provides new information about how the Administration bungled the NEO itself, including failure to vet the tens of thousands of individuals the Administration asked U.S. servicemembers to evacuate, endangering servicemembers’ safety and ultimately the safety of the American people.
The American public wants and deserves accountability for what transpired in Afghanistan last year, and this report is an important step in that direction. Yet the Armed Services Committee has ignored it since its release. Members of this Committee appear to be either unfamiliar or misinformed about its contents. Just yesterday morning, for instance, one Senator said it was “categorically untrue” that the Biden administration had months of warning that the Afghan government might collapse rapidly. This is wrong. As the Central Command report and other sources show, multiple commanders of U.S. forces in Afghanistan advised the Administration in the spring and summer of 2021 to prepare for the rapid collapse of the Afghan government. But the Administration ignored them.
A rigorous and public review of the Central Command investigative report is the necessary and appropriate next step to ensure accountability for the disaster in Afghanistan and prevent another like it. I am aware that Congress has directed an outside commission to study our decades-long engagement in Afghanistan. But that look-back, which may take years to complete and will not focus on the events detailed in the Central Command report, is no substitute for actual congressional oversight. I therefore call upon you to promptly convene open hearings. These hearings should allow us to hear from the leaders responsible for the disaster, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has thus far only testified before this Committee in a closed setting. They should also – and critically – allow us to hear directly from those who were on the ground during those fateful weeks, including the U.S. military commanders cited by the Central Command investigation.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: New Hawley Bill to Strengthen Afghan Vetting Procedures, Declassify Afghanistan Withdrawal Intel
Date: Thursday, March 03, 2022

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Afghanistan Vetting and Accountability Act,
a bill to strengthen vetting procedures for Afghans who were evacuated to the United States following Joe Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Senator Hawley’s bill would implement careful and appropriate vetting standards for evacuees and declassify intelligence related to the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.
Senator Hawley said, “Nearly seven months after the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, there has been zero accountability. Now we know that the vetting process for evacuees was rushed and careless. My bill would implement strong new vetting procedures, declassify intelligence related to the withdrawal, and take steps to ensure public transparency and accountability for a disaster that claimed the lives of 13 American service members.”
A
Pentagon Inspector General report
released last month revealed numerous failures in the Biden administration’s vetting process, including at least 50 evacuees with significant security concerns who were allowed to enter the U.S.
Bill text can be found

The
Afghanistan Vetting and Accountability Act
would:
Require the Department of Homeland Security to verify the personal and biometric information of individuals evacuated from Afghanistan last year.
Instruct the Department of Homeland Security to conduct in-person vetting interviews with all evacuees from Afghanistan.
Require the Secretary of Homeland Security submit a vetting certification and quarterly report to Congress on the list of evacuees. This quarterly report will include any known criminal records and the current vetting status of Afghan evacuees.
Restrict public welfare from those evacuees who do not complete appropriate in-person vetting as required under this Act.
Declassifies all intelligence related to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan to improve public accountability.

Title: Hawley Urges Passage of Bill Restoring American Energy Independence, Ending Reliance on Foreign Nations
Date: Thursday, March 03, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered remarks on the Senate Floor and requested unanimous consent for his
American Energy Independence Act of 2022, which would reverse President Biden’s shutdown of the American energy sector and return American energy to full production. Democrats objected to the bill’s passage.
Immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of oil
rose to over $100 a barrel
for the first time since 2014. Gas and energy prices for working Americans are quickly rising to record highs. The Biden Administration
has been reluctant
to sanction the Russian energy sector, due to the United States’ dangerous dependence on foreign energy.
Senator Hawley said, “Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to this administration’s dangerous policy of American weakness and in support of the strong men and women of the United States energy sector who are ready to step forward, to return this nation to energy independence, to burnish this nation’s strength, and to show the Russians what the United States is capable of. It will be lost on no one that we are approximately a week into the largest conventional military attack in Europe since 1945. Vladimir Putin’s brutal war of choice against the Ukrainians continues as we speak. It grows worse, more devastating, and more brutal by the hour, and it’s time that in the midst of this war we confront a basic fact — that Russia isn’t so much a country as it is a gas station, and Vladimir Putin’s gas station is open for business and pumping away. And this administration, Mr. President, has made the decision to make this country more dependent on Russian oil, to make the world more dependent on Russian oil, to embolden and empower Vladimir Putin at a time when the world can ill-afford it. And it is time to change course. And we can change course.”
He continued, “And that’s why I have introduced legislation along with Senator Grassley and Senator Hagerty and Senator Tuberville that would do just this. It would reverse the disastrous energy policies of this administration, the policies that have emboldened and enabled and empowered Vladimir Putin and the Russian military and return this country to energy strength, return this country to energy dominance.”

Title: Hawley Leads Bill Restoring American Energy Independence, Ending Reliance on Foreign Nations
Date: Monday, February 28, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the American Energy Independence Act of 2022, which reverses President Biden’s shutdown of the American energy sector and returns American energy to full production. Original cosponsors include: U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.). U.S. Representative Ronny Jackson (TX-13) is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
Immediately following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of oil
rose to over $100 a barrel
for the first time since 2014. Gas and energy prices for working Americans are quickly rising to new highs. The Biden Administration
has been reluctant
to sanction the Russian energy sector, due no doubt to the United States’ dangerous dependence on foreign energy. At the same time, European countries, particularly Germany, are heavily dependent on Russian natural gas.
“To be strong and free as a nation, we must be energy independent. My bill will reverse Joe Biden’s disastrous energy surrender that has allowed Russian energy dominance and instead open up American production full-throttle,”
said Senator Hawley.
“To stand up to aggressors like Vladimir Putin, we can and we must work to power our nation and the world.”
“Energy security is national security, and we see that clearly with what is going on in Ukraine. Since his first day in office, Joe Biden has worked overtime to crush American energy interests. Consequently, we went from being energy independent to relying on Russian oil. We are now helping Putin, a ruthless dictator, finance his invasion of Ukraine. Our response has been hindered because of our and our NATO allies’ dependence on Russian oil. Had Biden maintained the American energy independence President Trump achieved, we would’ve been set to crush Russian oil and end their ability to make war against Ukraine,”
Representative Jackson said. “Americans are also feeling the pinch of Biden’s War on Energy at the gas pump and when they pay their utility bills. It’s past time we put America First and end this nonsense. Senator Hawley and I are proud to introduce this bill, which will return the United States to the forefront of global energy production. We must protect American interests and give our allies the option to purchase American oil instead of Russia’s.”
“Energy costs were already skyrocketing due to Pres. Biden’s disastrous policies that have made us more reliant on energy from places like Russia. Putin’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine will make matters worse for energy costs at home. Now more than ever, we need to reclaim our energy independence so Iowa families don’t continue paying the price for this administration’s failures. That’s why I’m proud to support the American Energy Independence Act, which will take critical steps to lower gas prices and unleash energy production right here in the United States,”
Senator Grassley said.
Senator Hagerty said, ”The Biden Administration’s war on American energy has placed severe burdens on the shoulders of American citizens and led to disastrous national security ramifications across the globe. For the sake of our national and economic security, we must immediately reverse course and re-establish the energy independence created by the previous Administration’s policies, which is exactly what this legislation would do.”
Shortly after coming into office, President Biden cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline, blocked new oil and gas leases, issued regulations designed to stymie domestic energy investment, and advocated for measures that focus more on Green New Deal priorities than on American security.
Text for the
American Energy Independence Act of 2022

Background
The American Energy Independence Act of 2022 will:
Assert that it is the official policy of the United States to achieve full energy independence and low energy costs for its citizens in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Instruct federal agencies to identify and rescind existing regulations that have the effect of reducing American energy independence, bar new climate rules that reduce energy security or raise energy prices, and direct agencies to work to achieve energy independence by 2024.
Ease the regulatory burden on energy companies engaged in fracking.
Restore the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline after its cancellation by the Biden Administration and ease the process for constructing new pipelines.
Defund the United States’ contributions to any provisions of the Paris Climate Agreement.
Promote oil and natural gas leases on federal land following the Biden Administration’s moratorium.
Codify the Trump Administration’s interpretation of “Waters of the United States” and nullify President Biden’s proposed replacement rule.
Lower the “social cost of carbon” to $0 per ton to focus government standards on boosting domestic energy production, rather than climate change.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine:
“Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine and invasion of its territory must be met with strong American resolve. President Biden must act now to hit Vladimir Putin where it hurts, beginning with Russia’s energy sector. The Biden Administration should sanction Russian energy production to a halt, and help arm the Ukrainians to defend themselves. At the same time, the White House should reopen American energy production in full. This is the time to show Russia and the world that America will not reward aggression and it will not be dependent on its enemies.”

The Hon. Merrick B. Garland
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Attorney General Garland,
I write with concern over new revelations that the 2016 Clinton campaign partnered with tech firms to hack the servers of the White House and Trump Tower in an attempt to promote the false narrative that President Trump was in collusion with Russia. The Clinton campaign may have engaged in criminal conduct that includes hacking into computer servers and lying to the FBI. These are serious crimes.
On February 11, 2022, Special Counsel Durham filed a motion to inquire into potential conflicts of interest in United States v. Sussmann, a criminal case concerning a Clinton Campaign operative lying to the FBI. In that motion, the Department of Justice disclosed the following findings:
At the direction of the Clinton Campaign, tech executives exploited their hacked access to non-public and proprietary internet data to establish a false narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.
This included taking data from Trump Tower, Donald Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the Executive Office of the President of the United States.
Michael Sussmann, while serving as an attorney for the Clinton Campaign, lied to the FBI General Counsel and attempted to funnel purported data that alleged a non-existent connection between the Trump Organization and Russia.
Susmann billed the Clinton Campaign for compiling and disseminating these allegations and regularly conferred with the General Counsel to the Clinton Campaign during the process.
Tech executives exploited their access to non-public and proprietary internet data to establish a false narrative tying then-candidate Trump to Russia with the intent of pleasing VIPs in the Clinton campaign.
These actions were part of a concerted effort to smear President Trump by promoting the false narrative that he was in collusion with Russia. But Special Counsel Durham concluded in his filing that despite the efforts of Sussman and others to tie President Trump to Russia, “[t]he Special Counsel’s Office has identified no support for these allegations.” Instead, a Department of Justice watchdog found that Department of Justice officials forged records to justify spying on the Trump campaign.
These shocking revelations show that the 2016 Clinton Campaign was a criminal enterprise involving lawyers, Big Tech, and current Biden Administration officials. The question now is whether anyone will be held accountable.
Finally, the Clinton Campaign’s criminal enterprise also includes many individuals currently serving in the Biden Administration—and in your personal office. The indictment implicates Jake Sullivan, who currently serves as President Biden’s National Security Adviser. His wife, Margaret Goodlander, currently serves as your counsel in your personal office and is herself close to Hillary Clinton, who attended Sullivan and Goodlander’s wedding. Others have already called for her to be recused from any consideration of the Durham investigation. I am calling on you to set a clear example and instruct Ms. Goodlander, and all of your other employees potentially implicated in the Clinton Campaign, to formally recuse from the Special Counsel’s investigation.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation and fulfill its oversight functions, please provide the following information by February 25, 2022:
Do you commit to ensuring the independence and integrity of the Special Counsel Durham’s investigation?
Do you commit to ensuring that anyone potentially associated with the 2016 Clinton Campaign is recused from any involvement in the Durham investigation—including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is cited in the indictment, and his wife Margaret Goodlander, currently serving as counsel in your personal office?
Please provide a complete list of all Department of Justice employees who are recused from the Durham investigation.
Does the Department of Justice currently have any investigations open into Hunter Biden, including for his sweetheart deals with Ukrainian energy company Burisma and Chinese companies?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Blasts Garland, Demands Answers on Coordination Between Biden Administration and NSBA for Memo Ordering FBI to Investigate Parents
Date: Tuesday, February 15, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding answers in light of recent revelations about the Biden Administration’s
controversial memo
instructing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate concerned parents speaking at local school board meetings.
Last year, Garland admitted he drafted the memo in response to a
letter
from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) smearing parents as “domestic terrorists.” Now, new reporting from
Fox News
revealed that the head of the NSBA had advance notice of Garland’s memo, despite Garland’s previous testimony that he was not aware of any coordination with the NSBA.
“We now know from documents unveiled this week that the NSBA did in fact have advance knowledge of your memo and what it would include. This is only the latest revelation of coordination between the Biden administration and the NSBA. Last month, documents revealed that Secretary of Education Cardona personally solicited the NSBA to send its letter. While you have tried to portray your memo as ordinary law enforcement activity, these documents suggest instead that an outside group was intimately involved with your decision to issue this memo,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He concluded, “The American people deserve answers. You said last fall that you did not know whether members of your office coordinated with the NSBA, but since then you have had plenty of time to find out. You must immediately explain your own role in this affair, as well as how intimately involved the NSBA and other groups were in shaping the official actions of your office.”
Senator Hawley also requested additional details about who wrote the controversial memo, what outside groups suggested language for the memo, and when the White House was made aware of the memo.
Last October, Senator Hawley
ripped Attorney General Garland
over his attempt to weaponize the FBI and
called for his resignation
following the memo from the NSBA revealing that the Biden’s Administration’s plan to intimidate parents with the FBI was premised with misinformation.

The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
Yet again, reports have revealed even more concerning details about your infamous school-board memorandum from last October. In light of those new revelations, you must promptly disclose how much coordination your Department—at any level—had with outside groups.
Your memo instructed the FBI and federal prosecutors to investigate parents who were speaking at school board meetings. Although you admitted that you issued the memo in direct response to a September 29 letter by the National School Boards Association, which smeared parents as “domestic terrorists,” you claimed in testimony before Congress that you did not know whether your office had other communications with that group. Specifically, you said, “I have no idea whether there were conversations with the School Board Association.”
We now know from documents unveiled this week that the NSBA did in fact have advance knowledge of your memo and what it would include. This is only the latest revelation of coordination between the Biden administration and the NSBA. Last month, documents revealed that Secretary of Education Cardona personally solicited the NSBA to send its letter. While you have tried to portray your memo as ordinary law enforcement activity, these documents suggest instead that an outside group was intimately involved with your decision to issue this memo.
To its credit, the NSBA has since apologized for its letter and disavowed it, saying there was “no justification” for it and that the letter “directly contradict[ed] our core commitment to parent engagement.” But nobody has yet received a public apology from you or Secretary Cardona. And you have continued to stay silent on questions about your office’s coordination with the NSBA.
That silence must end. The American people deserve answers. You said last fall that you did not know whether members of your office coordinated with the NSBA, but since then you have had plenty of time to find out. You must immediately explain your own role in this affair, as well as how intimately involved the NSBA and other groups were in shaping the official actions of your office.
Please provide responses to the following questions by March 1:
You previously testified that you “worked on [the memo] myself.” Exactly what did your work on this memo entail?
If another person was the principal drafter,
Who was it?
Did you request any changes?
If so, what were those changes?
Did anybody at or on behalf of the NSBA, or any other outside organization, suggest language for the memo?
Did you or anybody in your office communicate with anybody at or on behalf of the NSBA between September 29 and October 4 last year?
Did you or anybody in your office communicate with anybody at or on behalf of the NSBA, or any other outside organization, before September 29 about topics addressed in the NSBA’s September 29 letter or your October 4 memo?
Did you or anybody in your office communicate with the White House before October 4 about this memo?
Did you or anybody in your office communicate with the Secretary Cardona before October 4 about this memo?
I await the Department’s response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Scorches Biden Administration’s Lack of Accountability on Afghanistan, Objects to DoD Nominees
Date: Thursday, February 10, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) objected to the unanimous consent of several Department of Defense nominations, followed by remarks that outlined the Biden administration’s failures and lack of accountability in the aftermath of the botched Afghanistan withdrawal last summer. He also reiterated how the administration is on the brink of another disaster, this time with Ukraine.
Senator Hawley said, “Here we are, six months since […] the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan. Thirteen service members killed, including one from my home state of Missouri. Dozens more wounded. Hundreds, hundreds of civilians killed, hundreds more, maybe thousands of American civilians, left behind enemy lines to terrorists, to fend for themselves. Still hundreds of Americans stranded there in Afghanistan as we speak.
“And what accountability has there been in this time? Who has been relieved of duty? Who has been shown the door? What have we learned? The answer is, there’s been no accountability. No one has been relieved of duty. No one has been shown the door. And now this Administration has bumbled to the brink of another foreign policy crisis that they have helped create, having denied Ukraine military aid – lethal aid – when it asked for it last spring, having stuffed dollars in Vladimir Putin’s pockets by greenlighting the Nord Stream 2 Energy Pipeline. And now here they are, on the verge of another foreign policy crisis, and still we have no answers. Still, we have no accountability.”
He went on to point to the recent reporting by the
Washington Post, detailing the warnings that the State Department and White House had received for months ahead of the disastrous evacuation of Americans and impending collapse of Kabul.
“So yes, I will be here, insisting on those answers, insisting on oversight, and insisting on accountability until we get it. Until that time, it is not too much to ask the Senate to do its job. I believe the Majority Leader said just the other day, that the Senate is here to vote. That’s what the Senate’s here to do. Well, that’s an apt phrase, Mr. President. And for once, I agree very much with the Senate Majority Leader. And for those reasons, I object,”
he concluded.
Following the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, Senator Hawley
pledged
to demand for accountability from the Biden Administration. Since then, he has
detailed the “phony culture war”
the Administration was fighting while Americans in Afghanistan paid the price,
called for an investigation
into the withdrawal, and
spoken
out multiple times on the Senate Floor.
Senator Hawley has called on
President Biden, General Milley, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Austin to
resign
for their roles in the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Title: Hawley and Hartzler Op-Ed: Ban Stock Trading in Congress
Date: Wednesday, February 09, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and U.S. Representative Vicky Hartzler (MO-4)
published an op-ed
with the Springfield News-Leader about the need to ban stock trading in Congress.
Last year, lawmakers in Washington bought over $267 million and sold $364 million in assets. One of the worst offenders is the Democratic House Speaker. In 2020, Speaker Pelosi and her husband managed to outperform the S&P 500 by a whopping 14.3 percent. That’s unusual. Making matters worse, almost 65 percent of her family’s investments are in Big Tech companies. One of Pelosi’s biggest gains came when her husband exercised options to purchase shares of Google, just one week before the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on antitrust legislation that would impact Big Tech. Regardless of her decision-making process, what you can’t deny is the clear appearance of a conflict of interest.
Americans don’t trust Congress. Last year, the number who did was just five percent. It’s not hard to see why. With corporate lobbying, billions of dollars in dark money, and rampant stock trading by members, voters simply do not believe that their representatives are working for them. That needs to change.
Clean government in Washington begins with members of Congress putting their financial interests on the back-burner. Working for the people is not about getting rich. It’s about putting the American people first in every decision, all the time. If there is even a whiff of a conflict of interest, then we must end it.
…
One of the most basic things that we should be able to expect is that people who serve in Congress will be focused on actually doing what the people want and not on lining their own pockets. That is why we have introduced the Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act. This legislation will prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from holding, acquiring or selling stocks during their tenure in elected office. Instead, members can put their savings into broad-based mutual funds, like those used by most Americans, or place their assets in blind trusts during their tenure in office. Members of Congress who violate this law will be required to forfeit all of their stock profits to the U.S. Treasury, returning all their gains to the people they are supposed to represent.
… It is time to restore the American people’s trust in their representatives and end stock trading in Congress.
Last month, Senator Hawley introduced the
Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act
to prohibit Members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. Representative Hartzler introduced the House companion.
Since then, mounting pressure to ban Congressional stock trading has forced even Nancy Pelosi to change her position and
admit she is open to a stock trading ban for members.

Title: Hawley Leads Bipartisan Legislation to Purge Slave Labor from Corporate Supply Chains
Date: Tuesday, February 08, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced
the bipartisan
Slave-Free Business Certification Act
to target forced labor in global supply chains and hold multinational corporations accountable. The legislation establishes new corporate supply chain disclosure requirements, mandates regular audits, puts CEOs on the hook for their company’s use of forced labor, and creates stiff penalties for firms that fail to uphold minimum standards for human rights. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is an original cosponsor.
For years, forced labor has persisted in the shadows, tainting both global supply chains and goods imported into the United States. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor estimated that nearly 25 million people were trapped in forced labor across 77 nations. Not only is the continued existence of forced labor a moral atrocity, but such practices deeply harm American workers and domestic producers by forcing them to compete on an uneven playing field against cheap, imported goods produced with exploitation.
“The scourge of global slave labor must end and multinational corporations complicit in this moral atrocity must be held accountable,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The bipartisan
Slave-Free Business Certification Act
takes important steps to make American supply chains slave-free, protect American workers, and end labor exploitation across the globe.”
Senator Hawley first introduced a
version of this proposal
in July 2020.
Background:
The
Slave-Free Business Certification Act
would:
Compel large corporations to disclose the steps they are taking to eradicate forced labor from their manufacturing supply chains.
Direct these companies to undergo rigorous independent audits on an annual basis to ensure they are not complicit in slave labor and labor trafficking, including through their suppliers.
Require these companies to submit the results of the audits to the Department of Labor and also make these disclosures publicly available. The Department will report to Congress those companies found to be complicit in forced labor.
Obligate CEOs to certify that their supply chains are free from slave labor or that they have reported all instances of forced labor in their company’s supply chain.
Assess financial penalties on those companies that evade the audit requirements, retaliate against workers, or fail to certify that their supply chain is slave-free.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Russia-Ukraine crisis – China is America’s biggest enemy, not Moscow
Date: Monday, February 07, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
published an op-ed
with Fox News on the Russia-Ukraine crisis and why China, not Russia, is America’s biggest enemy.
The United States is better off without Ukraine joining NATO. But when I sent a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken last week explaining why, the usual Washington suspects – the people who delivered two failed wars, botched the evacuation in Afghanistan, and enabled the rise of China – had their usual meltdown.
…
American foreign policy should be based on what’s best for preserving American freedom and American prosperity, not expanding an empire of “liberal order” around the world. Too many in the Washington cartel – of both parties – have forgotten this. With China rising, now is the time to get it right.
For decades, the Washington foreign policy establishment has aimed to extend a “new world order” of liberal values across the globe…
That project has not succeeded. Instead, Americans have spent decades fighting endless wars in the Middle East under the banner of democracy promotion and surrendered millions of working-class jobs to China. Thousands of American have lost their lives, with tens of thousands more wounded. The Washington elite have shelled out trillions on nation-building abroad while families and towns in this nation have languished, denied industry and good-paying jobs.
Americans deserve better. They deserve a foreign policy that protects their interests. Above all, that means preventing any other nation from imposing its will on us. Today, the principal threat comes from China. Beijing took advantage of America’s adventures in the Middle East to grow its strength. Now it towers over Asia, an economic and military giant ready for conquest.
…
So we must not let Beijing succeed. Fortunately, there is still time to deny China’s hegemonic ambitions, starting in Asia. But – and here is the key point – doing so will require us to do less in other theaters.
…
The United States should also end its support for Ukraine’s membership in NATO. To be sure, America has an interest in Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity. And we have a strong interest in deterring Russian adventurism. But these interests are not so great that we should commit ourselves to fight Russia over Ukraine’s future. Instead, we should provide Ukraine what lethal and other aid it needs to defend itself and use sanctions and other non-military tools to support its defense, while reducing our military footprint in Europe.
The Washington establishment will fight hard to keep this from happening. But this is the same establishment whose failures brought us to today’s sorry state. Americans deserve better. American freedom in the 21st century depends on it.

Title: Senator Hawley: DOJ’s Lenient Sentencing for BLM Rioters Exposes “Toxic Ideology of Critical Race Theory”
Date: Thursday, February 03, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Attorney General Merrick Garland this week demanding answers on the Department of Justice’s decision to pursue a lenient sentence for a BLM rioter because of what he was protesting.
Last year, Montez Terriel Lee, Jr.
broke into
the Max It Pawn Shop in Minneapolis, Minn., and poured fire accelerant throughout the store. The body of 30-year-old Oscar Lee Stewart was found in the rubble of the pawnshop, and medical examiners attributed his death to “probable inhalation of products of combustion and thermal injury (building fire).” Lee’s casual violence, in short, killed Mr. Stewart.
During Lee’s sentencing process, the Department of Justice
contended
that “the analysis of the [Sentencing] Guidelines does not appear appropriate” because Lee “appears to have believed that he was, in Dr. King’s eloquent words, engaging in ‘the language of the unheard.’”
Senator Hawley wrote, “Lee’s crime is atrocious, and he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But shockingly, your Department has taken a quite different approach—arguing that Lee deserves leniency because of the circumstances of the crime. Specifically, the Department argued in its position statement that ‘Lee’s motive for setting the fire is a foremost issue” and that “there is no basis to disbelieve [his] statement’ that ‘he was in the streets to protest unlawful police violence against black men'”
He continued, “What this position statement makes clear is that, under your leadership, the toxic ideology of critical race theory has spread through the Department. While you treat persons charged with petty offenses from the January 6 riot as hardened criminals, now even the most heinous offenses can be treated leniently, as long as the perpetrator is of the correct race and the crime can be connected to some progressive cause célèbre.”
Senator Hawley requested answers to several questions, including what legal authority the Department relied upon to justify asking for a below-guidelines sentence in this case, and whether the Department had sought other reduced sentences for rioters on the grounds that they were protesting for a supposedly righteous cause.

or below.
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
The riots of 2020 caused dozens of deaths and destroyed billions of dollars’ worth of property. It is imperative that those who committed crimes be held accountable. And yet your Department of Justice is apparently determined to do the opposite.
Recent news reports have brought to light a statement of the “position of the United States with respect to sentencing” in the case of Montez Terriel Lee, Jr., filed in November 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. As the Department acknowledged, on May 28, Lee broke into the Max It Pawn Shop and poured fire accelerant throughout the store. As the pawnshop burned, Lee proclaimed, “F*** this place. We’re gonna burn this b**ch down.”Lee then moved off with a group of other men, talking about the restaurants they planned to “hit” next.
But Lee didn’t just destroy property. The body of 30-year-old Oscar Lee Stewart was found in the rubble of the pawnshop, and medical examiners attributed his death to “probable inhalation of products of combustion and thermal injury (building fire).”Lee’s casual violence, in short, killed Mr. Stewart.
Lee’s crime is atrocious, and he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But shockingly, your Department has taken a quite different approach—arguing that Lee deserves leniency because of the circumstances of the crime. Specifically, the Department argued in its position statement that “Lee’s motive for setting the fire is a foremost issue” and that “there is no basis to disbelieve [his] statement” that “he was in the streets to protest unlawful police violence against black men”The Department went on to note that, during the protests,
There appear . . .  to have been many people who felt angry, frustrated, and disenfranchised, and who were attempting, in many cases in an unacceptably reckless and dangerous manner, to give voice to those feelings. Mr. Lee appears to be squarely in this latter category. And even the great American advocate for non-violence and social justice, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated in an interview with CBC’s Mike Wallace in 1966 that “we’ve got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard.”
As a result, the Department contended that “the analysis of the [Sentencing] Guidelines does not appear appropriate” because Lee “appears to have believed that he was, in Dr. King’s eloquent words, engaging in ‘the language of the unheard.’”
Let’s be clear: this is abject nonsense. The evidence in this case depicts Lee engaging in premeditated arson and destruction of property, attacking business targets entirely unrelated to the death of George Floyd or any other individual. There appears to be little external evidence that Lee was in fact motivated by belief in the righteousness of his cause—and even if there was, it wouldn’t matter. Belief in a political cause does not excuse arson.
Rather, what this position statement makes clear is that, under your leadership, the toxic ideology of critical race theory has spread through the Department. While you treat persons charged with petty offenses from the January 6 riot as hardened criminals, now even the most heinous offenses can be treated leniently, as long as the perpetrator is of the correct race and the crime can be connected to some progressive cause célèbre.
We’re already reaping the consequences of this ideology at the state and local level: district attorneys infected with this criminal-first worldview now treat violent felons with kid gloves, leading to the crime wave we are presently seeing in major cities across America. And now, perhaps unsurprisingly, that poison has reached the federal justice system.
Americans deserve equal justice under law, not far-left politicking that makes them less safe.
Please provide my office with responses to the following questions:
In how many cases involving criminal conduct arising from the riots of summer 2020 has the Department argued for a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines? Please provide a list of all such cases.
In how many cases involving criminal conduct arising from the riots of summer 2020 has the Department argued that “the analysis of the Guidelines does not appear appropriate” on the theory that the criminal conduct was committed in the context of outrage over the death of George Floyd? Please provide a list of all such cases.
On the basis of what legal authority did the Department conclude that the fact that criminal conduct was committed in the context of outrage over the death of George Floyd can justify a downward departure from the Guidelines sentencing range?
I await your responses.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley to Biden Administration: Ukraine’s Prospective NATO Membership Hurts U.S. Interests, We Must Focus on China
Date: Wednesday, February 02, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Secretary of State Antony Blinken to seek clarity on the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine’s prospective NATO membership and to express concern that it would threaten U.S. interests by drawing attention away from the China threat.
“Today, an increasingly powerful China seeks hegemony in the Indo-Pacific. If China succeeds, it could harness that region’s resources to further propel its rise, while restricting U.S. access to many of the world’s most important markets. Americans’ security and prosperity rest upon our ability to keep that from happening,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
“The United States has an interest in maintaining Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. And we should urgently deliver to Ukraine assistance it needs to defend itself against Russia’s military buildup and other threats. Our interest is not so strong, however, as to justify committing the United States to go to war with Russia over Ukraine’s fate. Rather, we must aid Ukraine in a manner that aligns with the American interests at stake and preserves our ability to deny Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific,”
he continued.
He concluded,
“Some argue that now is not the right time to ask hard questions about Ukraine’s prospective membership in NATO. But I submit that now is exactly the right time for confronting hard truths. Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s borders makes apparent just how important it is for the United States to be deliberate about its commitments abroad.”

here
or below.
The Honorable Antony Blinken
Secretary of State
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20520
Dear Secretary Blinken,
I write to request clarity about the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine’s prospective membership in NATO.
Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides for the Alliance’s expansion. It stipulates that such expansion can occur only by unanimous agreement and that only a “European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area” may receive invitation to the Alliance. The United States has supported multiple rounds of NATO enlargement since the end of the Cold War, consistent with the requirements of Article 10.
The United States has also signaled support for further enlargement, including to Ukraine. As the United States and its allies declared at the 2008 Bucharest Summit, “NATO welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO.” You testified to this effect before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 8, 2021, when you stated, “We support Ukraine membership in NATO.” Yet it is not clear that Ukraine’s accession would serve U.S. interests. Indeed, deteriorating conditions in the global security environment caution otherwise.
The world of 2008 is gone. Today, an increasingly powerful China seeks hegemony in the Indo-Pacific. If China succeeds, it could harness that region’s resources to further propel its rise, while restricting U.S. access to many of the world’s most important markets. Americans’ security and prosperity rest upon our ability to keep that from happening, and so the United States must shift resources to the Indo-Pacific to deny China’s bid for regional domination. This means the United States can no longer carry the heavy burden it once did in other regions of the world – including Europe. To the contrary, we must do less in those secondary theaters in order to prioritize denying China’s hegemonic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.
This Administration’s support for Ukraine’s membership in NATO defies these realities. The United States has an interest in maintaining Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. And we should urgently deliver to Ukraine assistance it needs to defend itself against Russia’s military buildup and other threats. Our interest is not so strong, however, as to justify committing the United States to go to war with Russia over Ukraine’s fate. Rather, we must aid Ukraine in a manner that aligns with the American interests at stake and preserves our ability to deny Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific.
Concerns about NATO enlargement might be lessened if our European allies were shouldering their fair share of the burden of our collective defense. Were they doing so, then it might not be so difficult for NATO to admit new members, without jeopardizing America’s ability to keep its focus on the Indo-Pacific. But that is not the case – in fact, it is quite the opposite.
In 2006, NATO allies agreed to spend at least two percent of national GDP on defense. They reaffirmed this commitment eight years later in the 2014 Wales Pledge. Yet today – more than 15 years since the initial spending agreement – only 19 have met their commitment. As U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith noted prior to her confirmation, “nineteen Allies out of thirty are not enough.” But this is an understatement. It also belies the fact that NATO’s two percent spending goal was adopted in and for a world that no longer exists. The world has grown far more dangerous in the years since 2006. As a consequence, two percent is no longer a sufficient minimum for allied defense spending. Put differently, the Wales Pledge is now obsolete. For NATO to remain viable, especially as the United States shifts resources to the Indo-Pacific, our European allies must increase defense spending above two percent of GDP.
Finally, some argue that now is not the right time to ask hard questions about Ukraine’s prospective membership in NATO. But I submit that now is exactly the right time for confronting hard truths. Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s borders makes apparent just how important it is for the United States to be deliberate about its commitments abroad. Already, President Biden has announced that the United States will send more conventional forces to Europe, if Russia invades Ukraine. Such a deployment can only detract from the U.S. military’s ability to ready and modernize forces to deter China in the Indo-Pacific. But those opportunity costs pale in comparison to what would be expected – indeed, required – of the United States, were NATO actually to admit Ukraine as a member.
China’s rise has collapsed basic assumptions in U.S. foreign policy. The legacy of a bygone era, the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine’s prospective membership in NATO demands particular scrutiny. Therefore, I request your written responses to the following questions no later than February 28, 2022:
How would Ukraine’s admission to NATO contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area, as required by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, particularly given Ukraine’s vulnerability to Russian invasion?
Do you believe Ukraine’s admission to NATO would improve U.S. national security sufficiently to justify the United States committing itself to fight Russia over Ukraine now or in the foreseeable future?
Were Ukraine to be admitted to the Alliance, would you be concerned about the United States’ ability to defend Ukraine against Russian military aggression, while simultaneously deterring or defeating Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific?
Do you commit to ask for and receive the Secretary of Defense’s certification that the U.S. military will be able to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, in cooperation with other NATO allies, without undermining its ability to simultaneously deter or defeat Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific, prior to taking any further action in support of Ukrainian membership in NATO?
Do you agree that NATO allies’ failure to spend more than two percent on their own defense necessarily limits the Alliance’s ability to accept additional members, particularly as the United States shifts military resources to the Indo-Pacific?
Do you agree that it would be prudent for the United States to wait until NATO allies, including Germany, are spending more than two percent of national GDP on defense before taking any further action in support of Ukrainian membership in NATO?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Answers on Illegal Aliens Using Arrest Warrants as Identification
Date: Tuesday, February 01, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator David Pekoske demanding answers on why illegal aliens have been allowed to present arrest warrants and notices of deportation as valid identification to pass checkpoints and board commercial airplanes.
Last week, a TSA spokesman told
Fox News
that, “For non-citizens and non-U.S. nationals who do not otherwise have acceptable forms of ID for presentation at security checkpoints, TSA may also accept certain DHS-issued forms, including ICE Form I-200 (Warrant for Arrest of an Alien).”
Senator Hawley wrote, “The point of an arrest warrant is for police to actively seek out and apprehend criminals. However, you have now confirmed that illegal aliens may present arrest warrants to federal officials to board commercial aircrafts. This dystopian inversion exceeds the point of absurdity where radical open-border policies attempt to accomplish the very opposite of DHS’s core mission: apprehending those who cross our borders illegally.”
He continued, “DHS and TSA should be focusing their efforts on their core responsibilities, such as preventing entry into the United States by those who pose a threat to homeland security— like Malik Faisal Akram, who recently flew from the United Kingdom into a New York airport and attempted an anti-Semitic terrorist attack in a Texas synagogue. It is time to reverse policies that glorify illegal immigration and start enforcing our immigration laws.”
Senator Hawley requested answers to addition questions including which Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components developed this policy and how this policy makes airports safer or stops illegal crossings at the southern border.

David P. Pekoske
Administrator
Transportation Security Administration 601 12th St S
Arlington, VA 20598
Administrator Pekoske,
I write with alarm over reports that you are allowing illegal aliens to present arrest warrants and notices of deportation as valid identification to pass checkpoints and board commercial airplanes. This policy subverts the rule of law and should be rescinded immediately.
A spokesman from the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told Fox News that, “Non- citizens and non-U.S. nationals who do not otherwise have acceptable forms of ID for presentation at security checkpoints, TSA may also accept certain DHS-issued forms, including ICE Form I-200 (Warrant for Arrest of an Alien).”
Furthermore, in response to an inquiry from Representative Gooden (R-TX), you said, “TSA established a process where it will accept certain DHS-issued forms for non-citizens and non-U.S. nationals who do not have otherwise acceptable forms of ID for presentation at its security checkpoints.”
You then went on to list the forms TSA may accept at the checkpoint, including:
ICE Form I-200 – Warrant for Arrest of Alien
ICE Form I-205 – Warrant of Removal/Deportation
ICE Form I-220A – Order of Release on Recognizance
ICE Form I-220B – Order of Supervision
DHS Form I-862 – Notice to Appear
CBP Form I-94 – Arrival and Departure Form (including a print-out of an electronic record)
DHS Form I-385 – Alien Booking Record
This is unacceptable. No government security agency should permit individuals to use an arrest warrant or deportation notice to pass a security check.
The point of an arrest warrant is for police to actively seek out and apprehend criminals. However, you have now confirmed that illegal aliens may present arrest warrants to federal officials to board commercial aircrafts. This dystopian inversion exceeds the point of absurdity where radical open-border policies attempt to accomplish the very opposite of DHS’s core mission: apprehending those who cross our borders illegally.
You also explained that passengers using alternative identification may require additional screenings to check if they are on a terrorist database. I have long advocated for stronger vetting procedures, including in-person vetting, for all who enter out country. But these additional screening efforts are inadequate to mitigate the efforts of a blanket policy that encourages individuals with arrest warrants to fly on commercial planes. If anything, the additional security protocols you have identified resemble the failed vetting standards applied to Afghan refugees who entered our country following the Biden Administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.
DHS and TSA should be focusing their efforts on their core responsibilities, such as preventing entry into the United States by those who pose a threat to homeland security— like Malik Faisal Akram, who recently flew from the United Kingdom into a New York airport and attempted an anti-Semitic terrorist attack in a Texas synagogue. It is time to reverse policies that glorify illegal immigration and start enforcing our immigration laws.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by February 28, 2022:
Which DHS component(s) developed this policy?
How many individuals have presented TSA with arrest warrants or deportation notices and were permitted to travel?
How does this new policy comport with 8 U.S.C. § 1325, which criminalizes the improper entry into the United States by an alien?
How does allowing illegal immigrants to show an arrest warrant, deportation notice, or any of the above listed documents increase security at American airports?
If an illegal immigrant presents an arrest warrant to progress through a checkpoint, is he subject to in-person interviews with the airports Federal Security Director (FSD)?
If so, what questions are asked and how does the FSD determine an illegal immigrant should proceed through the designated checkpoint or board a commercial aircraft?
How does this policy help stop illegal crossings or lessen the crisis at the southern border?
How does allowing alternative identification help prevent future terrorist attacks, like the recent anti-Semitic synagogue attack in Texas?
Please produce all records relating to the development, discussion, and coordination of these policies, including any and all communications with the Secretary of DHS and with the Department of Justice.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Real Clear Politics: Hawley Pushes Stepped-Up Human Trafficking Reforms
Date: Wednesday, January 26, 2022

Content:
This week U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) talked to
Real Clear Politics
about the necessity of tougher legislation against human trafficking.
…Congress is expected to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act this year, and Hawley, RealClearPolitics is first to report, plans to introduce a host of reforms to strike harder at human traffickers while also providing new support for victims as they try to get back on their feet.
“We are a nation of liberators, and the fight against global slavery is an urgent fight that needs leadership right now. It’s not going to happen without leadership from the United States of America,” Hawley said in an interview, citing the need to set an example domestically for the rest of the world.
“The number of people trapped in global slavery has been going up, not down. It is truly a scourge that continues to affect us in this country, to impact our own children, whether we’re talking about sex trafficking, or labor trafficking,” he continued.
…Hawley’s office has spent months preparing  an “all of the above” strategy to combat what the first-term senator described as “a pernicious crime that persists in the shadows.” Just last week, for instance, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina brought charges against individuals for conspiring to traffic seasonal farm workers, allegedly failing to pay their wages, forcing them to work excessively long hours, and confiscating their passports.
…“The United States has tremendous moral capital to bring to bear here on this fight — our own struggle with it in our country, our history struggling to end slavery in this country, struggling to secure freedom to all of our people and all of our citizens,” he said. “All of this positions us to be a leader worldwide, and to say, ‘We have not accepted slavery or servitude in our country. We’re not willing to partner with it in any way around the globe.’”

Title: Hawley: Why is DHS Focusing on Woke Climate Agenda Instead of Border Crisis?
Date: Thursday, January 20, 2022

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding answers on the agency’s Climate Change Professionals Program and why they are focusing on woke partisan government programs while ignoring the
crisis
at our southern border.
Senator Hawley wrote, “In a press release, you said, ’The Climate Change Professionals Program will be instrumental in helping the Department adapt to our changing climate by providing hands-on experience and guidance to young professionals interested in climate adaptation and resilience. This program will develop the next generation of climate experts, improve climate literacy throughout the Department, and help us execute our Climate Action Plan to remain mission-resilient while reducing our own impacts on the environment. Meanwhile, the southern border is experiencing a surge in drug trafficking and illegal border crossings…”
“The surge in fentanyl has been so dramatic that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) issued its first public safety report in nearly six years. The report shows that four out of every ten pills containing fentanyl carry a lethal dose… This is the worst border crisis in American history, yet it seems that the message is not making it through,”
he continued.
Senator Hawley requested answers on the structure and legitimacy of DHS’ new climate program, including: how would creating the Climate Change Professionals program help diminish the crises at the southern border? And how would creating the Climate Change Professionals Program help stop the flow of fentanyl over the southern border?

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary
Department of Homeland Security
301 7th Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
I write with concern over the Department of Homeland Security’s announcement to create a new Climate Change Professionals Program. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the crisis at the southern border, you are prioritizing the creation of woke partisan government programs.
In a press release, you said, “The Climate Change Professionals Program will be instrumental in helping the Department adapt to our changing climate by providing hands-on experience and guidance to young professionals interested in climate adaptation and resilience. This program will develop the next generation of climate experts, improve climate literacy throughout the Department, and help us execute our Climate Action Plan to remain mission-resilient while reducing our own impacts on the environment.”
Meanwhile, the southern border is experiencing a surge in drug trafficking and illegal border crossings. For example, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) announced this month that southern Texas had experienced a 1,066% increase in fentanyl seizures in the past year.  Agents at eight ports seized 87,652 pounds of narcotics, including 588 pounds of fentanyl. The surge in fentanyl has been so dramatic that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) issued its first public safety report in nearly six years. The report shows that four out of every ten pills containing fentanyl carry a lethal dose.
There is also a surge in illegal border crossing. According to CBP, there have been 1,734,686 encounters with migrants for FY 2021.   This is the worst border crisis in American history, yet it seems that the message is not making it through. Despite a court order to enforce the Remain in Mexico Policy, there are reports that only 40 migrants per day were being returned to Mexico—compared to the approximately 5,000 illegal border crossing each day.
It is well past time to start prioritizing the border crisis. The American people are relying on you to do so. Prioritize the border, stop creating woke climate programs, and enforce the law.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by February 15, 2022:
What is the Department’s statutory authority for the Climate Change Professionals Program?
How does creating the Climate Change Professionals Program fit into the mission and timeliness of the current priorities of the Department of Homeland Security?
How would creating the Climate Change Professionals Program help diminish the crises at the southern border?
How would creating the Climate Change Professionals Program help stop the flow of fentanyl over the southern border?
How much funding, staffing and government resources will be used to create the Climate Change Professionals Program?
How much funding and staffing throughout the Department of Homeland Security are currently working on issues dealing with climate change

Title: Following Synagogue Attack, Hawley Demands Explanation for How Islamic Terrorist Entered Country
Date: Tuesday, January 18, 2022

Content:
Senator Hawley Calls on Biden to Immediately Recognize Attack as Anti-Semitism
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas demanding a full explanation for how the Islamic terrorist who attacked Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, TX was allowed to enter the country despite
his extensive criminal record and numerous red flags. Senator Hawley writes that while the administration has refused to acknowledge this an anti-Semitic attack, President Joe Biden must do so immediately.
“The failure to adequately vet those entering our country is nothing new. The Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans into the United States,”
writes Senator Hawley.
“It is past time to begin conducting in-person vetting of immigrants to this country. That is what the 9/11 Commission report strongly recommended. It should now be clear that this is necessary to protect U.S. citizens from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.”
In December 2021, Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas announced new policies eliminating in-person interviews for visa applicants, which Senator Hawley
called on the administration to immediately rescind.
In light of these changes, Senator Hawley asked the administration to answer by January 21, 2022 whether the Islamic terrorist had received an in-person interview before being permitted to enter the country, whether federal agencies were aware of his criminal record, and on what basis he was granted a travel visa.

The Hon. Alejandro Mayorkas
Secretary of Homeland Security
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
301 7th Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretaries Blinken and Mayorkas,
I write with alarm over reports that the Islamic terrorist who took hostages at a Jewish synagogue in Texas this past weekend was granted a travel visa, despite his long criminal record and a series of red flags. This failure comes in the wake of the Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and failure to vet the tens of thousands who were evacuated to our country. I have repeatedly called on this Administration to require in-person vetting to avoid precisely the sort of terrorist incident we witnessed this weekend. Yet the Biden Administration has moved in the opposite direction, waving in-person vetting for new classes of visa holders. It is time to reverse this trend and begin enforcing our immigration laws. A key step in this effort is understanding how your agencies allowed the terrorist who took hostages in Texas into this country despite his known background.
The hostage crisis this weekend was an anti-Semitic attack on the Jewish community in a house of worship. It was perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist who had a criminal history and yet was able to obtain a travel visa to the United States during the pandemic. On December 27, 2021, he traveled from the United Kingdom to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, where he was welcomed into this country just weeks before the terrorist attack. But this all could have been averted if your Departments had adequately vetted his visa application and stopped him at the airport.
According to reports, [
1
] the Islamic terrorist had a lengthy criminal history. He was a 44-year British citizen with a number of red flags:
In 1996, he served a 6-month jail sentence for violent disorder following a baseball bat attack on a member of his extended family.
In 1997, he served another jail term for destruction of private property.
In 1999, he was jailed for harassment and, after release, jailed again for violating the terms of his release.
In September 2001, he was banned from a local courthouse for threatening staff on multiple occasions, including on days when he was not due in court. According to reports, he would rant about the September 11 attacks.
In 2012, he was arrested for stealing a phone and robbing a man of £5,000.
While serving time in prison, he was reported by the prison Imam for “concerning and disruptive behavior” at Friday prayers.
He regularly visited Pakistan and was reportedly a member of Tablighi Jamaat—an Islamic organization banned in several countries and known for its ties to terrorism.
He regularly participated in anti-Semitic demonstrations and marched for the release of terrorist prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay.
According to reports, he was also known to British intelligence and was recently a “subject of interest.” [
2
] How is anyone with this background allowed to enter our country? Indeed, that was the same reaction that the terrorist’s brother and neighbors had. Either your Departments knowingly allowed entry to someone with demonstrated sympathies for terrorist organizations and predilection toward violence, or they failed to conduct even a cursory background check.
Even during the standoff with the terrorist while he was still alive, the Biden Administration was in denial that an anti-Semitic terrorist attack was underway. The FBI’s Special Agent in Charge said, “We do believe from our engaging with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community.” [
3
] An Islamic terrorist had a rabbi and other members of the congregation at gunpoint, held as hostages, in the Jewish synagogue, and yet the Biden Administration could not bring itself to recognize this abhorrent anti-Semitic attack.
The failure to adequately vet those entering our country is nothing new. The Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans into the United States. We now know that these individuals were not adequately vetted and did not undergo in-person vetting, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission.
I have repeatedly called on the Biden Administration to address this issue and conduct in-person vetting.
October 2021, I criticized the Department of Defense over revelations that the Biden Administration was more focused on packing exit planes with evacuees than conducting proper vetting. [
4
]
On November 16, 2021, I questioned Secretary Mayorkas at a Judiciary Committee hearing over his failure to vet tens of thousands of evacuees. [
5
]
On December 16, 2021, I wrote to Secretary Blinken with two of my Republican colleagues requesting further information regarding the vetting of Afghan refugees. [
6
]
Yet at the same time, your Departments have moved in the opposite direction, going to so far as to waive the use of in-person interviews for entire classes of visa applicants—policies that I demanded you rescind in my January 5, 2022 letter addressed to you both. [
7
]
It is past time to begin conducting in-person vetting of immigrants to this country. That is what the 9/11 Commission report strongly recommended. It should now be clear that this is necessary to protect U.S. citizens from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, please provide the following information by January 21, 2022:
Did the Islamic terrorist receive an in-person interview before he was permitted entry into the United States?
Were federal agencies aware of the Islamic terrorist’s criminal record when it granted his travel visa to the United States?
Was the intelligence community aware of any derogatory information on the Islamic terrorist at the time that he entered the United States?
On what basis did your Departments grant the Islamic terrorist his travel visa?
What plans do your Departments have to implement in-person vetting and other measures in the wake of this terrorist attack?
Do you acknowledge that this was an anti-Semitic attack by an Islamic terrorist in a religious house of worship?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill Banning Insider Trading in Congress
Date: Thursday, January 13, 2022

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R.Mo) announced he will introduce the
Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act, which would prohibit Members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. The bill will require Members found in violation to return their profits to the American people.
Senator Hawley said, “Year after year, politicians somehow manage to outperform the market, buying and selling millions in stocks of companies they’re supposed to be regulating. Wall Street and Big Tech work hand-in-hand with elected officials to enrich each other at the expense of the country. Here’s something we can do: ban all members of Congress from trading stocks and force those who do to pay their proceeds back to the American people. It’s time to stop turning a blind eye to Washington profiteering.”
Background
The
Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act
will:
Prohibit Members of Congress and their spouses from holding, acquiring, or selling stocks or equivalent economic interests during their tenure in elected office. Any holdings in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds are exempt from the prohibition.
Give Members of Congress and their spouses six months, upon assuming office, to divest any prohibited holdings or place those holdings in a blind trust for the remainder of their tenure in office.
Ensure Members or their spouses forfeit any investment profits to the American people via the U.S. Treasury if they are found to be in violation if the Act.
Members who violate the requirements will also lose the ability to deduct the losses of those investments on their income taxes. The ethics committees of Congress may levy additional fines and will publicize violations.
Require that after two years of the Act’s implementation, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will conduct an audit of Members’ compliance with the Act.

Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer
Meta Platforms, Inc.
1 Hacker Way
Menlo Park, CA 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,
Last month, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) published the results of an investigation which found that drug dealers openly operate on Instagram and sell illicit substances that are easily accessible to teenagers as young as 13 years old. Not only does Instagram allow teenagers to easily search for Xanax, Adderall, ecstasy, and a variety of prescription opioids, some of which are laced with fentanyl, but the report also finds that the “platform’s algorithms helped the underage accounts connect directly with drug dealers” and “started recommending other accounts selling drugs.”
The findings of the report are horrifying, especially as our nation confronts a drug overdose epidemic of historic proportions and an alarming deterioration of teenagers’ mental health precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic and misguided mitigation measures to it. According to provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics released in November, more than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the 12-month period between May 2020 and April 2021—a record high and a 30 percent increase over the previous year.Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts were 51 percent higher for adolescent girls in early 2021 compared to the same time period in early 2019.
It is unconscionable that any company would aid and abet this epidemic of death and despair. Unfortunately, given Instagram’s blatant disregard for the mental health of its young users, the findings from TPP’s investigation are not shocking. The findings further demonstrate the need to pass legislation to hold social media companies like Instagram accountable for the harm it inflicts on young Americans, as I have proposed. In the meantime, American parents deserve to know the steps your company is taking to ensure that their children do not have access to illicit drugs.
Please respond to the following questions by January 31, 2022:
Instagram’s Community Guidelines state that the “buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs are…not allowed.”[6] What steps has Instagram taken to prevent the sale of illicit and prescription drugs on your platform?
What protocols does Instagram have for the removal of accounts selling drugs? How many accounts have been removed for violations?
Does Instagram currently partner with law enforcement when dealing with accounts selling drugs? If so, what does this partnership entail? If not, does your company plan to begin doing so?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Demands Answers After Intel Apologizes to CCP, Scrubs References to Chinese Slave Labor
Date: Tuesday, January 11, 2022

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger demanding answers on the company’s failure to condemn slave labor in their global supply chains and their apparent willingness to accommodate the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This comes after Intel
scrubbed all references to Xinjiang
from its annual supplier letter and
apologized to the CCP
for implementing U.S. law.
Senator Hawley wrote, “In its December 2021 annual letter to suppliers, Intel noted that the company is ‘required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.’  Apparently, such boilerplate language was too much for the Chinese Communist regime to abide. Only one week after the letter was published in the U.S., Intel posted an apology on Chinese social media, saying the letter was only written to ‘comply with U.S. law.’”
He continued, “Intel’s recent willingness to accommodate Beijing is startling. An objective observer could reasonably assume that your company will look away from human rights abuses if acknowledging them risks provoking the ire of a major commercial interest. And due to these actions, how can we be certain that Intel is serious about implementing requirements set forth by U.S. law with respect to forced labor?”
Senator Hawley called on Intel to clarify how they plan to ensure their supply chain is free of forced labor, whether they removed references to Xinjiang from their letter following pressure from Beijing, and whether they believe the U.S. government should do more to ensure corporate supply chains are slave-free.

Patrick P. Gelsinger
Chief Executive Officer
Intel Corporation
2200 Mission College Blvd.
Santa Clara, CA 95052
Dear Mr. Gelsinger:
I write today to express my concern that Intel Corporation seems willing to support global slavery in its business practices. I would hope this is not the case, but recent actions taken by your company have not inspired confidence. It’s imperative that you provide Congress and the public with an explanation.
The State Department’s 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report made clear that forced labor – the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel individuals to perform labor – remains a persistent challenge globally. Nowhere is this grievous practice more evident than in China’s Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) subjects an estimated one million Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic and religious minorities to slave labor and other human rights abuses. In response to these atrocities, Congress overwhelmingly passed and President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, important legislation that strengthens our country’s bans on the importation of goods made with forced labor.
In its December 2021 annual letter to suppliers, Intel noted that the company is “required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” Apparently, such boilerplate language was too much for the Chinese Communist regime to abide. Only one week after the letter was published in the U.S., Intel posted an apology on Chinese social media, saying the letter was only written to “comply with U.S. law.”
Worse, Intel has now scrubbed its supplier letter of all references to Xinjiang.[1] Intel’s recent willingness to accommodate Beijing is startling. An objective observer could reasonably assume that your company will look away from human rights abuses if acknowledging them risks provoking the ire of a major commercial interest. And due to these actions, how can we be certain that Intel is serious about implementing requirements set forth by U.S. law with respect to forced labor?
Please provide my office with written responses to the following questions no later than January 31, 2022:
How does your company plan to ensure that its supply chain is free of any forced labor if you cannot publicly make a statement of fact about Xinjiang?
Yesterday, you said that “We found that there was no reason for us to call out one region in particular anywhere in the world because there’s many regions in the world that are having issues of such a matter.”[2] What is your company’s stance on Xinjiang in particular and the plight of Uyghur Muslims and other religious minorities there? Please provide a clear and succinct statement describing Intel’s position.
When did your company remove references to Xinjiang from its annual supplier letter? Did your company have plans to announce the changes before they were publicly reported on?
Did you scrub your supplier letter of references to Xinjiang out of concern that it would impact your commercial interests in the People’s Republic of China? Did the Chinese government threaten your company with any type of penalty if you failed to eliminated such references?
What actions does your company take to ensure that suppliers and secondary suppliers do not have problematic ties to the Xinjiang region? Please describe your company’s protocols and remediation practices with respect to forced labor in Xinjiang.
Do you think that the U.S. government should be taking more robust action to ensure that corporate supply chains do not allow global slavery to persist?
Has Intel engaged the government of the People’s Republic of China with regard to its ongoing human rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere, and if so, what was the outcome of any such engagement?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

to Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) demanding they condemn the “Candle Light Vigil for Democracy” organized by antifa activists and to urge members in their caucuses to cancel their planned support of the event.
Several Democrats, including Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) are reportedly speaking at the event tonight which was organized, in part, by
Shut Down DC.
Senator Hawley wrote, “The organizers behind this event have a history of engaging in extremist tactics to interfere with workings of democracy. During a week where you have vociferously condemned those who tried to obstruct congressional proceedings last January 6th, you must also be similarly willing to call out leftist activists who have also engaged in criminal acts to interfere with democracy.”
He continued,
“When it comes to political violence and criminal obstruction of government by the left, the silence by Democrats has been deafening. Democrats looked the other way when antifa rioters torched a federal courthouse in Portland. They did the same when left-wing rioters in Seattle seized power from a democratically elected government and tried to secede by creating a breakaway anarchist zone. And they did the same when hundreds unlawfully trespassed into the Senate to disrupt the nomination process of Justice Kavanaugh and then tried to breach the Supreme Court in an attempt to prevent Justice Kavanaugh from taking his oath.”
Shut Down DC has engaged in calculated, unlawful harassment campaigns against many government officials. Last year,
Shut Down DC showed up at Senator Hawley’s house
at night to harass his wife and newborn baby. They screamed threats through bullhorns, vandalized property, trespassed, and physically shoved a neighbor who asked them to stop. The group’s leader was charged with — and pled to — criminal trespass.
“If in fact you truly believe that attempts to interfere with democracy should be condemned, then you must break from your past silence and begin condemning those actions when they are committed by the left. It is imperative that you ask members of your caucus to shun groups like Shut Down DC and to cancel their plans to speak at their event,”
Senator Hawley concluded.

Title: Hawley Op-Ed: Democrats brought us a year of fear in 2021. In 2022, let us be not afraid and reclaim our American spirit
Date: Wednesday, January 05, 2022

Content:
On Tuesday, Senator Hawley (R-Mo.) published
an op-ed with Fox News
on the left’s year of fear mongering.
2021 was a year of fear instigated by Democrats and the Left. 2022 doesn’t have to be. It can be the year we say no to fear and reclaim our heritage as Americans.
The fear campaign started on January 6, following the demonstration in Washington that turned violent after some demonstrators breached the Capitol. But that was only the second most surprising thing about that day. The most surprising outcome—and the day’s true legacy—was the Left’s attempt to use the Capitol unrest to foster a permanent climate of fear and repression.
…
What interested the Left about the riot on January 6 was that it could be connected to Trump supporters, conservatives. They proclaimed conservatives a threat to public safety and marshaled their institutional power to drive political opposition into silence.
A year later, we know all too well what this looks like.
It looks like the president of the United States brazenly lying about election integrity laws in Georgia and coordinating with Major League Baseball to kill thousands of jobs in that state to the tune of $100 million.
It looks like the Attorney General deploying the National Security Division of the Justice Department against parents who speak out at school board meetings, all while lying about it to Congress.
It looks like government lawyers drawing up lists of federal crimes for which these same parents could be prosecuted should they dare raise their voices about their children’s education.
It looks like Big Tech relentlessly censoring citizens’ questions about election integrity, and then about the origins of COVID, and then about the assault on women’s sports, enforcing the Left’s party line.
In sum, it looks like the most powerful members of our government and society deploying their authority against ordinary people exercising ordinary rights, with the purpose of intimidating them into silence.
…
2022 can be a new chapter if we take a stand against those who would use their power to terrorize and intimidate.
This year, don’t give into fear. Don’t be shouted down. Don’t be intimidated. This year, let’s live instead by this maxim: We will not be afraid, because we are Americans.

Title: Hawley Demands DOS and DHS Rescind New Policies Eliminating In-Person Interviews for Visa Applicants
Date: Wednesday, January 05, 2022

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Department of State Secretary Antony Blinken and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after both departments announced they would dispense with in-person interviews during the vetting process for roughly 49,000 immigrant visa applicants, and eliminate altogether the interview requirement for spouses and children of refugees seeking citizenship.
Sen. Hawley is demanding that the departments rescind the new policies, and also called out the Biden Administration for normalizing its historic failures in the Afghanistan withdrawal — including its failure to implement standard in-person vetting of more than 80,000 Afghan refugees.
Senator Hawley writes, “The first and highest priority of our immigration system is homeland security. It is paramount that we ensure that everyone who enters our country does not pose a threat to public safety. But it appears that the Biden Administration is now doubling down on its failed attempt to adequately vet those evacuated from Afghanistan. These new policies are a transparent ploy to normalize that failed vetting process.”
You can read the full letter
HERE
and below:
January 5, 2022
The Honorable Antony Blinken Secretary of State
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW Washington, D.C. 20520
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 301 7th Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20528
Secretary Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas,
I write with grave concern over the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security’s unjustifiable decision to dispense with in-person interviews for those wishing to immigrate to our country. These policies are dangerous and transparent attempts to normalize the Biden Administration’s historic failures during the evacuation from Afghanistan. They should be rescinded immediately.
President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of the worst military fiascos in modern history. On August 26, 2021, thirteen American servicemembers were killed by an explosion at Kabul airport, and hundreds of civilians were injured. During the haphazard airlift, the Biden Administration evacuated over 80,000 individuals from Afghanistan. But we now know that the Biden Administration failed to adequately vet those brought to the United States.
Our nation’s immigration policies have generally required that immigrants undergo an in-person interview so that government officials can review immigrants’ documents and evaluate the truthfulness of their claims. Indeed, the 9/11 Commission’s report emphasized that several would-be terrorists were thwarted by the in-person interview process. For example, “One potential hijacker was turned back by an immigration inspector as he tried to enter the United States. The inspector relied on intuitive experience to ask questions more than he relied on any objective factor that could be detected by ‘scores’ or a machine. Good people who have worked in such jobs for a long time understand this phenomenon well.”1 Examples like this illustrate the critical role that in-person interviews play in our immigration programs.
Yet last month, the Department of State announced that it will temporarily waive the interview requirement for roughly 49,000 immigrant visa applications.2 Under this temporary rule, consular officers will have “discretion to allow this subset of immigrant visa applicants to affirm the accuracy of the contents of their application without appearing in person before a consular officer.”
Also last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it is waiving the interview requirement for certain spouses and children. Remarkably, Biden Administration officials have indicated that they now believe the in-person interview requirement is “inconsistent” with President Biden’s executive orders calling for a more inclusive immigration system.
The first and highest priority of our immigration system is homeland security. It is paramount that we ensure that everyone who enters our country does not pose a threat to public safety. But it appears that the Biden Administration is now doubling down on its failed attempt to adequately vet those evacuated from Afghanistan. These new policies are a transparent ploy to normalize that failed vetting process.
I therefore call on you to immediately rescind these misguided policies and ensure that everyone who enters this country has been adequately vetted.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Lankford Demand DHS Stop Hiding Required Report on Visa Overstays
Date: Tuesday, December 28, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after the Senators uncovered that DHS has not provided the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee or the public with the Fiscal Year 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report.
The Senators wrote in their letter, “These reports hold vital information for our oversight work of your Department and for the public as the American people seek to assess the impact of the Biden Administration’s immigration enforcement efforts. Your continued delay in providing these reports violates the law and raises significant questions about your commitment to uphold the laws Congress enacts.”
You can read the full letter
HERE
and below:
December 21, 2021
The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas Secretary of Homeland Security
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. S.E.
Washington, D.C. 20528-0525
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
We write today to express our concern that the US Department of Homeland Security has not provided our Committee or the public with the FY 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report. This report includes information on the estimated number of individuals who have received a nonimmigrant visa but “remained in the United States beyond the authorized admission.” For the past five years, DHS has published this report on a public website with the recognition that the estimated number of visa overstays is important to the public, to academics and researchers, and to lawmakers in Congress who are charged with oversight of DHS and our nation’s immigration system.
We have become aware that the FY 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report was transmitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary on or about September 30, 2021. As you may be aware, the FY 2021 funding package mandated that this report be sent to our Committee, which has oversight over DHS and over the Entry/Exit system. DHS also failed to meet a November 30 deadline to submit a congressionally mandated report over its vetting of Afghan evacuees. These reports hold vital information for our oversight work of your Department and for the public as the American people seek to assess the impact of the Biden Administration’s immigration enforcement efforts. Your continued delay in providing these reports violates the law and raises significant questions about your commitment to uphold the laws Congress enacts.
We are concerned that DHS did not publish the FY 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report on a public website out of concerns that this report would complicate the conversation around the “Plan C” amnesty proposals in the Democrats’ partisan reconciliation package. As you are aware, the US House of Representatives recently passed the President’s “Build Back Better” proposal on a party-line vote. This bill would offer parole to illegal immigrants who have continuously resided in the United States since January 1, 2011. This parole would put these illegal immigrants on the path to citizenship. The bill passed by the House and currently under consideration in the Senate would offer this parole benefit to illegal border crossers and to visa overstays – the same population included in the Department’s missing report.
Our staff obtained a copy of the missing FY 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report. The copy reviewed by our staff stated that the number of expected departures were 17.40 percent lower than anticipated, which led to an increase in the total number of overstays. The report further estimates that there were nearly 585,000 suspected in-country visa overstays in FY 2020 alone. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over 6.5 million illegal immigrants would receive amnesty under the Build Back Better plan. The DHS estimates in the FY 2020 Entry/Exit Overstay Report may complicate existing estimates about the number of illegal immigrants who would receive parole under the Build Back Better plan, and we are concerned that the Department’s efforts to hide this number from the public are nothing more than a political cover for the Build Back Better plan’s radical, open border policies and provisions.
As some elected representatives in Congress consider whether to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, it is vital that our Committee and the public have information from DHS on how many visa overstays are in the country and could benefit from this proposed amnesty. To better understand why DHS did not release this report to the public, we ask the following questions:
1.      Why did DHS not post the FY 2020 Entry/Exit Visa Overstay report on the public website where it has posted the five prior years’ reports?
2.      Why did DHS not include the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs as a recipient on this report, even though Congress mandated that HSGAC receive this report?
3.      Did DHS not share this report with the public out of concerns that it would impact the debate around the partisan amnesty provisions in President Biden’s reconciliation bill?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Secures Top Missouri Priorities in 2022 NDAA, Leads Effort to Remove Female Draft Provision
Date: Wednesday, December 15, 2021

Content:
Today the Senate passed the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022, in which U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) fought to secure numerous top Missouri priorities. The final NDAA prohibits the use of Chinese printed circuit boards in critical defense systems, provides billions for the production of aircraft and ships in Missouri, and includes millions of dollars in funding for Missouri military bases.
Senator Hawley said,

This bill makes progress addressing the China threat and provides crucial funding for the men and women of the armed forces who call Missouri home.”
Senator Hawley
successfully led Republicans
in removing language from the NDAA that would have expanded the military draft to women.

Title: Hawley Leads Letter to Blinken Demanding Answers on Nigeria’s Removal from Religious Freedom Violators List
Date: Monday, December 13, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
penned a letter
to Secretary of State Antony Blinken demanding answers on why Nigeria was removed from the State Department’s list of Countries of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and requesting they be placed back on the list.
Senator Hawley was joined by Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)
“Religious people in Nigeria face severe persecution at the hands of radical terrorist groups and even their own government. In fact, more Christians are murdered for their faith in Nigeria than in any other country. Violent attacks against religious congregations perpetrated by Boko Haram, Islamic State-West Africa, and others target Christians and Muslims alike. Not only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges…”
the Senators wrote.
They continued,
“Yet this year, without explanation, the Department of State has removed Nigeria completely from its lists of severe religious freedom violators. We find this development alarming given Nigeria’s appalling record.”
In addition to requesting Nigeria be redesignated as a Country of Particular Concern, the Senators also asked for answers to the following questions:
Why did the Department of State remove Nigeria not only from its list of Countries of Particular Concern, but also from its Special Watch List? Please provide the Department’s specific reasoning for this decision.
Which criteria were used to make the Department’s decision? Were factors not related to religious freedom considered in the decision-making process?
How does the Department’s decision comply with the statutory requirements under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, specifically the requirement in 22 U.S.C. § 6442(b)(1)(B) for the president to fully consider the CPC recommendations of USCIRF when making CPC determinations?
Was the substance and/or timing of the Department’s announcement made with regard to any official state travel by you or any other official in the Biden Administration?

The Honorable Antony Blinken
Secretary
United States Department of State
2201 C St NW
Washington, DC 20520
Dear Secretary Blinken:
On November 17, the Department of State released its annual list of countries which merit designation as Countries of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. These countries represent the worst violators of religious freedom in the world and count China, Iran, and North Korea among their ranks. Today, we write to express our deep concern that Nigeria has been omitted altogether from this year’s list.
Religious people in Nigeria face severe persecution at the hands of radical terrorist groups and even their own government. In fact, more Christians are murdered for their faith in Nigeria than in any other country. Violent attacks against religious congregations perpetrated by Boko Haram, Islamic State-West Africa, and others target Christians and Muslims alike. Not only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges. Despite its constitution protecting freedom of religion and belief, Nigeria’s record on religious freedom is, in a word, abysmal.
These atrocities committed against religious people finally earned Nigeria its designation as a Country of Particular Concern last year. The Department of State’s designation recognized that conditions had escalated since 2019, when Nigeria was first included on the Department’s Special Watch List for severe violators. Additionally, this designation aligned with action that has been recommended by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) since 2009.
Yet this year, without explanation, the Department of State has removed Nigeria completely from its lists of severe religious freedom violators. We find this development alarming given Nigeria’s appalling record. While much of the violence in Nigeria overlaps with ethnic conflicts, hostility between ethnic groups is not solely to blame. Religious intolerance and persecution is a primary factor, and it is important that the State Department acknowledge that.  It is clear to us that religious freedom conditions in Nigeria have not seen consummate improvement to warrant this abrupt change in designation after such a brief period. Therefore, we urge the Department to immediately reconsider its decision and redesignate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern.
In addition, please provide responses to the following questions no later than two weeks from your receipt of this letter:
Why did the Department of State remove Nigeria not only from its list of Countries of Particular Concern, but also from its Special Watch List? Please provide the Department’s specific reasoning for this decision.
Which criteria were used to make the Department’s decision? Were factors not related to religious freedom considered in the decision-making process?
How does the Department’s decision comply with the statutory requirements under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, specifically the requirement in 22 U.S.C. § 6442(b)(1)(B) for the president to fully consider the CPC recommendations of USCIRF when making CPC determinations?
Was the substance and/or timing of the Department’s announcement made with regard to any official state travel by you or any other official in the Biden Administration?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Title: Hawley Demands Accountability for Biden’s Afghanistan Debacle, Blasts Dems for Failure to Manage Senate Floor
Date: Thursday, December 09, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) spoke on the Senate floor to demand accountability for President Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which left 13 U.S. service members dead. In September 2021, Senator Hawley
announced he will force the Senate to vote on
nominees for leadership positions at the Department of Defense and the Department of State until Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, and Jake Sullivan resign.
Senator Hawley went on to criticize Senate Democrats who are concerned about the pace of confirmations for their failure to schedule votes on nominees.
Senator Hawley said,
“Well, Mr. President, I for one am not willing to stand by and participate in that kind of theater again. I am not going to go back to the families of the fallen in my state and say that I didn’t do anything while people in this body looked the other way. It’s time that there was accountability. And so is this a protest that I am lodging by asking the Senate to actually vote on these nominees? You bet it is. You bet it is. Because we don’t need more leadership of the same kind in the State Department. We don’t need more leadership of the same kind in the Department of Defense. We need a different kind of leadership. We need a different direction for this country. And until there is accountability, I’m going to ask that the Senate do the simple task of its job, which is to actually vote on these nominees.”

Title: Hawley, Blunt Ask Biden Administration for Answers on Goodfellow Federal Center Oversight Following Toxic Exposure
Date: Tuesday, December 07, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)
wrote a letter
to the General Services Administration (GSA) demanding answers on oversight failures over the Goodfellow Federal Center, in St. Louis, Mo., which exposed workers and a childcare facility to “widespread, longstanding” contaminants including asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and explosive materials.”  A
report
from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch says that GSA officials “deliberately misled tenants about the well-documented health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis.”
“In a letter from the U.S. Office of Special Council (OSC) to President Biden, that office reported that officials knew about these contaminations since at least 2002. The OSC letter also states that officials did not take substantial action to notify workers or tenant agencies of the dangers and that officials issued overtly misleading communications to employees that exhibited a ‘pattern of suppressing or downplaying risks,’”
the Senators wrote.
They continued,
“Federal officials should be providing proper oversight and protection for workers, not ignoring worker safety. At a bare minimum, Missouri workers deserve a safe work environment and honest stewardship from supervisors and their government officials.”
In addition to requesting proper federal oversight, Senators Hawley and Blunt requested answers to the following questions:
What is your office doing to assist workers at the Goodfellow Federal Center who have been exposed to dangerous or toxic materials?
What is your plan to ensure workers at the Goodfellow Federal Center do not suffer financial harm, loss of employment, unreasonable relocation standards, or any other financial burden resulting from facility changes or facility closure efforts?
What are you doing to discipline officials in your office who misled, attempted to downplay, or hid the dangerous working conditions for employees at the Goodfellow Federal Center? Please include a list of all disciplinary actions take thus far.
What plan does your office have to ensure better oversight strategies and management policies for facilities which have been reported to have dangerous working conditions?
How is your office planning to ensure that claims of unsafe workplaces are properly investigated in light of the recent findings at the Goodfellow Federal Center?

The Honorable Robin Carnahan
Administrator
United States General Services Administration
1800 F Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20405
Dear Administrator Carnahan:
We write with concern over reports that GSA officials have failed to provide proper oversight over the Goodfellow Federal Center, in St. Louis Missouri, which exposed workers to toxic and explosive materials.
According to a report from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, workers and a childcare facility at the Goodfellow Federal Facility in St. Louis were exposed to “widespread, longstanding” contaminants including asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and explosive materials.”
The report says GSA officials “deliberately misled tenants about the well-documented health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis.” We recognize that the report was referring to events that occurred before your tenure as GSA Administrator.
In a letter from the U.S. Office of Special Council (OSC) to President Biden, that office reported that officials knew about these contaminations since at least 2002. The OSC letter also states that officials did not take substantial action to notify workers or tenant agencies of the dangers and that officials issued overtly misleading communications to employees that exhibited a “pattern of suppressing or downplaying risks.”
The letter also referenced a response from the Federal Occupational Health (FOH) agency during a recent investigation, which reported that there was a “significant pattern of ongoing, self-perpetuating management defects including a lack of oversight by and requirements/orders from the GSA central office, the site/region’s deficient environmental management systems, their management culture and history of noncompliance, group think, a disbelief/discounting of the opinions and recommendations of subject matter experts, absent or overtly misleading hazard communication and a poor performance incentive system…”
If this continues to be the case it is unacceptable. Federal officials should be providing proper oversight and protection for workers, not ignoring worker safety. At a bare minimum, Missouri workers deserve a safe work environment and honest stewardship from supervisors and their government officials.
Please provide the following information by December 15, 2021:
What is your office doing to assist workers at the Goodfellow Federal Center who have been exposed to dangerous or toxic materials?
What is your plan to ensure workers at the Goodfellow Federal Center do not suffer financial harm, loss of employment, unreasonable relocation standards, or any other financial burden resulting from facility changes or facility closure efforts?
What are you doing to discipline officials in your office who misled, attempted to downplay, or hid the dangerous working conditions for employees at the Goodfellow Federal Center? Please include a list of all disciplinary actions take thus far.
What plan does your office have to ensure better oversight strategies and management policies for facilities which have been reported to have dangerous working conditions?
How is your office planning to ensure that claims of unsafe workplaces are properly investigated in light of the recent findings at the Goodfellow Federal Center?

Title: Senator Hawley Pens Letter to Mayorkas Slamming Double Standard with DHS Application Processing
Date: Monday, December 06, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
penned a new letter
to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, slamming the agency for prioritizing thousands of non-citizens over American families seeking answers about their international adoptions. Sen. Hawley highlighted the Department’s failure to unite a Missouri couple with their adopted child and requested the specific actions it will take to expeditiously respond.
“Your agency has repeatedly brushed off the Trowers by providing an indefinite timeline for their adoption case, leaving them to wait for months on end to learn when they might be united with their adopted child. […] At least twice this year, USCIS has declined to provide this family with a timeframe for a decision. Hardly efficient,”
Sen. Hawley wrote.
“In contrast, your agency rushed over 100,000 Afghans through immigration processes, often foregoing full vetting altogether, following President Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Today, the Department of Homeland Security even waives filing fees and expedites applications for these Afghans. Meanwhile, American families following the law are told to stand by indefinitely.”
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is a subagency of DHS which is involved in processing international adoptions. Sen. Hawley’s office has written repeatedly to USCIS – including USCIS Director Ur Jaddou – on behalf of the Trowers, but the agency has failed to provide a timeline for a decision.
“It should not be more difficult for adopting parents in the United States to even know whether or not they will be united with their children than it is for thousands of unvetted refugees to enter our country,”
Sen. Hawley stated in his letter.
The Senator has previously
questioned
Secretary Mayorkas on the Biden Administration’s process for allowing Afghan evacuees into the country.

Title: Congress Poised to Strike Provision Expanding Draft to Women Following Hawley Demand
Date: Monday, December 06, 2021

Content:
Press reports indicate that, following a months-long effort led by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), language expanding registration to the draft for women will be removed from the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
Senator Hawley said,
“It appears the NDAA will no longer require women to register for the military draft. I certainly hope that is the case. If it is not, then I will keep fighting for a vote on the Senate floor to strip this wrong and misguided provision out of the final bill.”
In July 2021, Senator Hawley
voted against expansion of the draft
during committee consideration. In November 2021, Senator Hawley
introduced an amendment
to the NDAA that would strip language expanding the draft from the bill.
Senator Hawley’s amendment was co-sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), Steve Daines (Mont.), James Lankford (Okla.), John Boozman (Ark.), Mike Lee (Utah), and Marco Rubio (Fla.).

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Move Forward with Preclearance Facility in Taiwan
Date: Thursday, December 02, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Taiwan Preclearance Act, which would affirm Taiwan’s importance in the Indo-Pacific and require a report on establishing a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) Preclearance facility in Taiwan’s Taoyuan International Airport. Senator Hawley’s bill would increase tourism between Taiwan and the United States while also stationing CBP officers in Taiwan.
The
Taiwan Preclearance Act
is co-sponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.). Representative Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) is introducing companion legislation in the House Representatives.
“Taiwan is a leading democracy, a vital partner of the United States, and the perfect place for America’s first preclearance facility in the Indo-Pacific,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The Taiwan Preclearance Act sets us on a path to establish just such a facility, which will not only benefit the American people, but also strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations as we work together to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
Senator Braun said,
“Taiwan is an excellent choice for the next Customs and Border Protection preclearance facility. The Taiwan Preclearance Act would establish a preclearance facility in the critical Indo-Pacific region and further strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan alliance through trade, tourism, and business.”
Senator Tuberville said,
“Taiwan is a beacon of democracy in the Indo-Pacific and a friend to our country. One way we can strengthen that democratic friendship is by establishing an efficient channel of safe trade and travel, especially given the region’s importance to America’s economic future. A preclearance facility in Taiwan would facilitate travel in a major transit point in Asia and help the U.S. prevent inadmissible travelers before they even board the plane.”
Senator Rick Scott said,
“Taiwan is one of our most valued and strategic partners in the Asia-Pacific. The Taiwan Preclearance Act will strengthen our economic and security partnership with Taipei, bolster the safety and security of all travelers and increase collaboration with the Taiwanese government. In the face of the growing threat of Communist China, we must be doing everything we can to enhance our relationship with our partners in region, and this bill is a great step in the right direction.”
“I’m excited to introduce this important measure in the House to ensure the United States’ support of an airport pre-clearance facility at the Taipei International Airport in Taiwan,”
said Representative Cammack.
“Taiwan is one of our most important allies and an essential economic partner with shared values and security priorities. This new pre-clearance facility will ensure easier, safer travel between Taiwan and the United States—something that is long overdue. I’m grateful to Senator Hawley for his leadership of this effort in the U.S. Senate.”

Title: Senator Hawley to Monitor SCOTUS Arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
Date: Wednesday, December 01, 2021

Content:
This morning, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will listen to oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the case of
Dobbs. V. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which will begin at 10:00AM EST. Senator Hawley will have further announcements as the arguments develop.
In July 2021, Senator Hawley led
an amicus brief, along with Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), urging the Court to use this opportunity to overrule
Roe v. Wade
and
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.
The senators wrote,
“This status quo is untenable. Where a legal doctrine has repeatedly failed to offer clarity—where it has proved unworkable in the past and will likely engender unpredictable consequences in the future—its existence constitutes an open invitation to judges to interpret it according to their own policy preferences, usurping the constitutional prerogatives of the legislature. Roe and Casey should be overruled, and the question of abortion legislation should be returned to the states.”

Title: Hawley Demands HHS Reinstate Religious Liberty Protections, Answers on Secret Rollback
Date: Tuesday, November 30, 2021

Content:
Following the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) November 24
decision to rescind
the HHS Office of Civil Rights’ authority to affirmatively protect Americans’ conscience rights pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Senator Hawley
penned a letter
to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra demanding he reinstate the protections and provide answers on why the policy was rolled back.
“As President Clinton remarked when signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law, religious liberty is the first freedom of American citizens. It is the responsibility of HHS, no less than any other governmental institution, to protect that liberty. Your November 24 decision to rescind the HHS Office of Civil Rights’ authority to affirmatively protect Americans’ conscience rights pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act —authority originally extended in December 2017—abdicates that responsibility,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “Let’s be clear: the only reason to remove RFRA compliance enforcement from the Office of Civil Rights is if your administration no longer believes that religious liberty is a civil right. Instead of affirmatively taking steps to ensure the Department is fully complying with its constitutional and statutory obligations, the underlying memo explains that the Office of Civil Rights will no longer “proactively” enforce RFRA. Instead, the burden will be on individual Americans of faith to hold the Department accountable for its conduct. And OCR sought to make this change in secret…”
Last month, Senator Hawley also
sent a letter
to the Biden Administration in defense of religious liberty regarding vaccine mandates and the Biden Administration’s failure to provide adequate safeguards for the sincerely held religious beliefs of federal employees and displays clear contempt for religious liberty.

____
The Honorable Xavier Becerra
Secretary of Health & Human Services
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services
200 Independence Avenue SW
Washington, D.C. 20201
Dear Secretary Becerra:
As President Clinton remarked when signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law, religious liberty is the first freedom of American citizens. It is the responsibility of HHS, no less than any other governmental institution, to protect that liberty.
Your November 24 decision to rescind the HHS Office of Civil Rights’ authority to affirmatively protect Americans’ conscience rights pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act —authority originally extended in December 2017—abdicates that responsibility.  Under this new approach, the Office of Civil Rights will no longer be directed to accept and investigate complaints of RFRA violations or conduct internal RFRA compliance reviews, among other changes.  This shift comes on the heels of a draft memo leaked from the Department’s Office for Civil Rights—signed by Lisa Pino, Director of that office—strongly suggesting that HHS has decided to shirk its obligation for self-evidently ideological reasons.
Let’s be clear: the only reason to remove RFRA compliance enforcement from the Office of Civil Rights is if your administration no longer believes that religious liberty is a civil right. Instead of affirmatively taking steps to ensure the Department is fully complying with its constitutional and statutory obligations, the underlying memo explains that the Office of Civil Rights will no longer “proactively” enforce RFRA. Instead, the burden will be on individual Americans of faith to hold the Department accountable for its conduct. And OCR sought to make this change in secret, stating that “[n]o formal rollout is planned for this action but we will need to provide confidential alerts to the White House and some members of Congress who work on civil rights and related issues.”
Indeed, the underlying memo was positively contemptuous of RFRA’s protections. While conceding that “some case law may support the prior Administration’s view of RFRA,” the underlying memo declared that the prior administration’s “expansive view of the use of RFRA . . . resulted in negative impacts for underserved communities.” This proposition was rooted in the extraordinary claim that “removing this delegation demonstrates our belief that RFRA is meant to be a shield to protect the freedom of religion, not a sword to impose religious beliefs on others without regard for third party harms, including civil rights.”  But this is merely a tired, ACLU-inspired talking point lacking any legal foundation whatsoever. The ACLU may have come to regret its past history of enthusiastic support for RFRA as the ACLU has transformed from a civil liberties group into a left-wing partisan group, but the plain text of the law remains.
Moreover, this claim is included in a section of the memo entitled “Noteworthy Elements about Equity.” But “equity” has nothing to do with RFRA—and indeed, mentioning it in this context betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the logic of the law. RFRA does not mandate “equity” in the sense of parity of outcomes across-the-board. To the contrary, the statute was passed in 1993 to mitigate the consequences of the Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, which suggested that religious liberty claims as such warranted no exemptions from neutral laws of general applicability.  Enacted in the wake of Smith, RFRA was an attestation of the singular place of free exercise of religion in American life, and statutorily reaffirmed the constitutional principle that religious liberty claims are entitled to “special solicitude.”  Accordingly, to invoke the idea of “equity” here, in the context of flattening down legal protections for religious liberty, is baldly contrary to RFRA’s intent.
I urge you to immediately reverse course and reinstate the Office of Civil Rights’ RFRA enforcement authority. Additionally, I request a response to the following questions no later than December 10, 2021:
Why did the underlying memo propose making this policy change without a “formal rollout”?
What third-party groups or resources were consulted during the development of the decision to rescind OCR’s authority?
What, if any, legal authority supports the underlying memo’s observation that RFRA ought to be understood as “a shield, not a sword”
I await the Department’s responses.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Blunt Press VA For Plan To Protect Veterans In Long-Term Care Facilities From Impact Of Federal Vaccine Mandate
Date: Tuesday, November 23, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough demanding answers on how veterans in long-term care facilities will be impacted by the COVID-19 federal vaccination mandate and what is being done to protect them.
“We are concerned that implementation of these federal vaccine mandates will cause Missouri’s long-term care facilities to lose their status as federal contractors with the VA and jeopardize the well-being of our veterans,”
the senators wrote. “Additionally, we are concerned that federal vaccine mandates will create staffing shortages in long-term care facilities in Missouri, and that there will not be an open, compliant facility with sufficient staff capacity to accept veteran patients.”
In the letter, the senators cite reports that veterans could be removed from facilities that are not compliant with vaccination mandates and press the VA for answers on what, if any, plan is in place to ensure their access to care.
The full text of the letter can be found
here
and below.
November 23, 2021
The Honorable Denis McDonough
Secretary of Veterans Affairs
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Ave, NW
Washington, D.C. 20420
Secretary McDonough:
We write to you with concerns about the impacts of COVID-19 federal vaccine mandates on our Missouri veterans in long-term care facilities.
The federal government has required COVID-19 vaccination under Executive Order 14042, which requires federal contractors to receive the vaccine by January 18, 2022, in addition to a mandate issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requiring staff at health care facilities to be vaccinated by January 4, 2022. Of Missouri’s 1,183 long-term care facilities, 522 participate in CMS programs, and 45 facilities contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide care for veterans who receive VA benefits.
We are concerned that implementation of these federal vaccine mandates will cause Missouri’s long-term care facilities to lose their status as federal contractors with the VA and jeopardize the well-being of our veterans.  Additionally, we are concerned that federal vaccine mandates will create staffing shortages in long-term care facilities in Missouri, and that there will not be an open, compliant facility with sufficient staff capacity to accept veteran patients. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued an emergency rule effective November 5 providing for the temporary emergency closure of skilled nursing and immediate care facilities experiencing staffing shortages as a result of COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
Our specific concerns regarding veterans in long-term care facilities stem from VA communication with long-term care facilities on this matter. According to news reports, email communications from the VA indicated veterans could be removed from facilities that are not compliant with vaccination mandates. The email notes that all federal contractors are covered under Executive Order 14042, and that long-term care facilities are also required to comply with the CMS vaccine mandate.
In light of this information, we request the following information by December 8th, 2021:
1. Has the VA established a contract termination process for facilities that are not compliant with the federal contractor vaccine mandate in Executive Order 14042, or with the CMS vaccine mandate? Please provide details on the nature of this process.
2. Has the VA made a determination that veterans will be removed from facilities that lose VA contractor status? Alternatively, could veterans at noncompliant facilities be forced to pay out-of-pocket expenses for services previously provided through the VA?
3. Should veterans be removed from noncompliant facilities by the VA, is there a plan to transition veterans to different facilities, and has this possibility been communicated to veterans and their families? What is the plan?
4. As previously mentioned, the VA only contracts with 45 long-term care facilities in the State of Missouri. Would the VA seek contracts with additional long-term care facilities in the area to ensure that veterans are not relocated to facilities far from their families?
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Title: Hawley Calls for Answers After JPMorgan Forces Missouri-Based Group to Cancel Event Featuring Donald Trump Jr.
Date: Thursday, November 18, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calling for answers after the bank canceled their contract with Defense of Liberty, a Missouri-based organization, forcing the group to
scrap a long-planned event
at the last minute.
WePay, which is owned by JPMorgan, was hired as a payment processor for the event but, upon learning that Donald Trump Jr. had been scheduled to speak, pulled their contract and claimed the event may be “illegal.” After the decision attracted media attention, the bank relented and claimed they had mistakenly canceled the contract.
“If your goal was to use the power of your company to stealth-cancel a conservative event, then you succeeded—to the detriment of the people of Missouri,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
“Frankly, your belated claim of an unspecified ‘mistake’ rings hollow, and requires explanation. As a bank that has taken billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts, you owe the public, to say nothing of your customers, an honest explanation as to why you canceled a contract on a transparently pretextual basis that you now admit was wrong. And you owe the public an explanation as to why you decided to target a conservative group on the basis of their speech.”

November 18, 2021
Jamie Dimon
CEO, JPMorgan Chase
270 Park Ave
New York, NY 10017
Dear Mr. Dimon:
I write to inquire about your decision to cancel, at the last minute, a contract with the conservative organization Defense of Liberty in Missouri. That cancellation has forced the organization to cancel an event it planned to hold in early December.
According to press reports, the organization hired you to process payments for the event. But after the organization scheduled Donald Trump, Jr., as its speaker for the December event, you unilaterally cancelled the contract. You said the contract was void because the event was supposedly “illegal” and “More specifically: Per our terms of service, we are unable to process for hate, violence, racial intolerance, terrorism….” Then you ignored requests by Defense of Liberty to discuss the issue. Only after your decision drew media attention did you engage in “further review”—your words—and declare that you had made a mistake.
Too little too late for the Missouri organization. If your goal was to use the power of your company to stealth-cancel a conservative event, then you succeeded—to the detriment of the people of Missouri.
Frankly, your belated claim of an unspecified “mistake” rings hollow, and requires explanation. As a bank that has taken billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts, you owe the public, to say nothing of your customers, an honest explanation as to why you canceled a contract on a transparently pretextual basis that you now admit was wrong. And you owe the public an explanation as to why you decided to target a conservative group on the basis of their speech.
Kindly respond to my office with a full accounting of your processes, including why those processes broke down, what about this conservative group was mistaken for “hate, violence, racial intolerance, terrorism…,” and how you plan to make the organization whole for your decision to break your contract.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: ICYMI: Hawley Op-Ed: Parents’ Bill of Rights is needed to combat Left’s indoctrination of students
Date: Wednesday, November 17, 2021

Content:
On Monday, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) published
an op-ed on Fox News
on his new
Parents’ Bill of Rights
:
As just about every parent with school-aged kids knows, the Left is trying to shut parents out of education.
Joe Biden’s Justice Department has tried to turn the FBI into a monitor of school board meetings, with one DOJ official going so far as to draw up lists of federal crimes for which parents could be prosecuted. Failed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe spoke the Democrat Party’s mind when he infamously said, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”
Wrong. Parents have every right to direct their children’s education, as the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized. Parents make our schools work. The Left’s concerted effort to silence parents’ speech and ridicule their concerns is dangerous – for our children, our schools, and our democracy. It’s time to do something about it.
That’s why I’m proposing a Parents’ Bill of Rights, for every mom and dad in America. My proposal would guarantee them the seat at the table they deserve, one that no bureaucrat – or political party – can take away.
The need for action is urgent. Democrats and their allies in academia increasingly view our schools as laboratories for the indoctrination of American children. Over the past year, we’ve learned how school districts have quietly introduced new learning materials in classrooms related to critical race theory – often without parents’ knowledge, let alone approval.

Title: Senator Hawley Slams Garland for Lying About FBI Targeting Parents, Demands He Testify Before Senate
Date: Wednesday, November 17, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
wrote
to Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding he answer questions about
whistleblower documents
showing the FBI is using its counterterrorism division to investigate and add “threat tags” to parents who speak out at school board meetings.
“Nearly every week, we discover new information that undermines your assertion that you are not using the FBI to target parents who wish to speak up in response to school boards that are pushing divisive ideologies like critical race theory or other highly controversial measures,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “I am calling for the Judiciary Committee to expeditiously schedule a hearing so you can answer these questions.”
In a
separate letter
to Chairman Durbin (D-Ill.), Senator Hawley requested a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing of the Department of Justice to address the whistleblower documents as well as why officials in the Department are threatening to prosecute parents under a law that was long ago repealed.
“Yesterday, a whistleblower revealed that the FBI has created an internal “threat tag” to track parents who speak up at school board meetings. The email was dated October 20, before Attorney General Garland testified to the Judiciary Committee. Yet at the hearing, Attorney General Garland told the committee that counterterrorism tools would not be used to track parents. Now we know such tracking is already underway,”
wrote Senator Hawley.
He continued, “When he testified, the Attorney General insisted that he never took any action to chill the free speech of parents. The actions of his department undermine that assertion and raise the alarming prospect that the Attorney General was lying or is not in control of his own department.”
Senator Hawley previously
asked
Garland to withdraw his October 4th memo directing the FBI to involve itself with local school board meetings, which has led federal prosecutors to threaten to prosecute parents under laws that were repealed long ago, and has
called
for his resignation.
Earlier this week Senator Hawley introduced legislation to defend parents’ role in education with a new
Parents’ Bill of Rights. On Fox News
last night, Senator Hawley discussed the whistleblower documents and called for Garland to address them under oath.

Title: Hawley Introduces Parents’ Bill of Rights to Defend Parents’ Role in Education
Date: Tuesday, November 16, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley introduced the
Parents’ Bill of Rights Act
to defend parents’ fundamental rights against efforts to shut them out of their children’s education. Senator Hawley’s bill would empower parents to sue federally-funded schools that do not protect certain basic rights, such as the right to know what their child is being taught and the right to know what outside groups are receiving school contracts.
Senator Hawley said,
“America has long recognized the right of parents to direct their children’s education but we are now seeing a concerted effort by the Left to shut parents out. Whether it’s Joe Biden’s Justice Department attempting to classify parents as ‘domestic terrorists’ or activists funded by dark money who seek to quietly introduce critical race theory into school curricula, education has taken a back seat to radical politics in many schools and parents are taking notice. It’s time to give control back to parents, not woke bureaucrats, and empower them to start a new era of openness in education.”
Background
The
Parents’ Bill of Rights Act
will empower parents to enforce the following rights against school systems receiving federal dollars:
The right to know what their minor child is being taught in school, including, but not limited to, curricula, books, and other instructional materials.
School and school districts shall be prohibited from requiring non-disclosure agreements or similar forms for parental review of curricula, and shall instead allow parents to make copies of curriculum documents.
The right to information on who is teaching their minor child, including guest lecturers and outside presenters.
Schools and school districts shall allow student involvement in school assemblies, field trips, and other extracurricular activities only if parents opt-in, rather than opt-out.
The right to information on individuals and organizations receiving school contracts and funding.
The right to visit the school and check in on their minor child during school hours.
The right to all school records, medical or otherwise, concerning their minor child.
The right to information about the collection and transmission of their minor child’s data.
Schools and school districts shall obtain parental consent prior to collecting any biometric data or other sensitive personal information on the minor child.
The right to have sufficient accountability and transparency regarding school boards.
School board meetings pertaining to curricula, safety, and other student issues shall be held in public and allow for public comments.
The right to know about situations affecting their minor child’s safety in school.
Parents shall be notified in a timely manner of all reported incidents pertaining to student safety, including all crimes or misdemeanors committed by teachers or other school employees.
Parents will be empowered to sue schools that do not protect these rights for injunctive relief. A pattern of such violations in a particular jurisdiction will trigger major reductions in federal education funding.

Title: Hawley Grills Mayorkas on Failure to Fully Vet Afghan Refugees, Biden Border Crisis
Date: Tuesday, November 16, 2021

Hawley also questioned Mayorkas on Biden’s proposed $450K payments to illegal immigrations and VP Harris’s failure as border czar
Today at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) grilled Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over DHS’s failure to fully vet thousands of Afghan refugees following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Secretary Mayorkas told Senator Hawley DHS is not conducting in-person interviews for all refugees and could not answer what percentage of refugees received an in-person interview.
Senator Hawley said,
“The fact that you are not conducting the most standard interviews for tens of thousands of people brought to this country is astounding to me and it seems to me you have not learned the most basic lessons that we learned on 9/11, since then, and the security risk is unbelievable.”
In a second round of questioning, Senator Hawley questioned Secretary Mayorkas on Biden’s planned $450,000 payments to illegal immigrants and Vice President Kamala Harris’s failures in her role as the administration’s border czar.

Content:
Five Senators have signed on to a new
amendment
led by U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would remove a provision currently in the bill that requires women to register for the Selective Service System.
U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (Tex.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), and Roger Marshall (Kan.) cosponsored Senator Hawley’s amendment this week. Should this year’s NDAA pass without it and the U.S. government initiates a military draft in the future, women would be forced to register.
Sen. Cruz said, “America’s military is a volunteer force made up of service members who decided for themselves to take the oath. My daughters know that they’re capable of achieving anything they set their minds to, but the idea that our government would force women into service through the draft to fight our nation’s wars is immoral and outrageous.”
“Our military has welcomed women for decades and is stronger for it. But America’s daughters should never be drafted against their will,”
Sen. Cotton said.
“I have great admiration for the women who serve in our Armed Forces, and every opportunity to serve should be available to women,”
said Sen. Hyde-Smith. “I do not, however, see any compelling reason to expand the Selective Service System.”
“I applaud the women who volunteer to serve in the military and who sacrifice every day for our country’s freedom, but to compel their service by law is wrong,”
Sen. Wicker said. “I along with millions of other Americans cannot support the idea that our daughters and granddaughters would be forced to fight in our next military conflict against their will.”
Sen. Hawley
said, “It is wrong to force our daughters, mothers, wives, and sisters to fight our wars. Our country is extremely grateful for the brave women who have volunteered to serve our country with and alongside our fighting forces. They have played a vital role in defending America at every point in our nation’s history. But volunteering for military service is not the same as being forced into it, and no woman should be compelled to do so.”
In July, Sen. Hawley
voted
against the Senate Democrats’
proposal
requiring women to register for the draft when the issue came before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Braun and Colleagues in Officially Challenging Biden’s Vaccine Mandate
Date: Friday, November 05, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and 38 Republican colleagues in formally moving to disapprove and nullify President Biden’s vaccine mandate on private employees under the Congressional Review Act, the official process for Congress to eliminate an Executive Branch rule. The Biden administration has
announced
U.S. businesses have until Jan. 4, 2022, to comply with their vaccine mandate.
“Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate is an unconstitutional infringement on the fundamental rights of American citizens. More than that, it unlawfully bypasses established regulatory procedures. Congress, not the President, has the authority to make law,”
said Senator Hawley.
“He is ignoring this basic principle by forcing employers to require their workers be vaccinated, undergo rigorous testing procedures, or be fired. It’s wrong, will make our nation’s economic challenges worse, and must not be allowed to go into effect.”
“Since the announcement of President Biden’s vaccine and testing mandate in September, I have led the charge to strike down this vast overstep of authority by the federal government. Today, we are one step closer to protecting the liberties of millions of Americans in the private sector workforce under the Congressional Review Act. I urge my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of this disapproval resolution in the coming weeks,”
said Senator Braun.
The federal vaccine mandate threatens to worsen the current labor shortage and supply chain issues. The federal directive will impact tens of millions of Americans and warrants review by Congress — the representatives elected by the American people to make the laws.
Senator Hawley has previously
demanded answers
on President Biden’s vaccine mandate for failing to provide adequate safeguards for the sincerely held religious beliefs of federal employees.
He has also
called for
an explanation of the supposed constitutional basis of the OSHA rule mandating vaccinations for 80 million private-sector workers.

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Daines and Colleagues to Block Taxpayer-Funded Payments to Illegal Immigrants in FY22 NDAA
Date: Wednesday, November 03, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Steve Daines (Mont.) and a group of Senators today in introducing a
new amendment
to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 that blocks President Biden’s reported plan to give illegal immigrants up to $450,000 per person in taxpayer dollars for settlements by the U.S. government, totaling upwards of a billion dollars.
The news
first gained attention at the end of last week.
“Joe Biden and his administration’s priorities are completely out of sync with American families, and their plan to pay people who come here illegally nearly half a million dollars is just the latest example,”
said Senator Hawley. “It’s frankly insulting they would plan something like this when Americans are facing a supply chain crisis, skyrocketing energy prices, and a struggling economy right now. They might as well put an ‘open’ sign at the southern border, because nothing could incentivize illegal immigration more.”
Senator Hawley and nine of his colleagues also joined Senator Kennedy on a
letter to the President earlier this week, opposing his administration’s plan to offer illegal immigrants up to $450,000 per person in taxpayer dollars.
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senators Tom Cotton (Ark.), John Kennedy (La.), Mike Lee (Utah), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), John Hoeven (N.D.), Todd Young (Ind.), Pat Toomey (Pa.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), John Boozman (Ark.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Richard Burr (N.C.), James Lankford (Okla.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), Jim Risch (Idaho) and Mike Crapo (Idaho) also joined Daines in introducing this amendment.
Senator Daines said, “Biden’s open border policies have reached a new crazy level. Montana families are struggling with inflation and skyrocketing costs on everything from gas to groceries because of Biden’s wasteful spending policies, and now the President wants to give hundreds of thousands of dollars to illegal immigrants. Because of Biden, our southern border has been taken over by Mexican cartels and this effort will only continue to incentivize illegal immigration making it worse. This is a gut punch to the American taxpayer.”

Title: Hawley Rips Garland for Encouraging Non-Criminal Prosecutions of Parents, Calls for Oct. 4th Memo to be Withdrawn
Date: Tuesday, November 02, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General Merrick Garland calling on him to immediately withdraw his October 4th memo directing the FBI to involve itself with local school board meetings, which has led federal prosecutors to threaten to prosecute parents under laws that were repealed long ago.
Senator Hawley writes that a memo from the U.S. Attorney in Montana, which directed law enforcement to “contact the FBI” if a parent calls a member of a school board “with intent to annoy,” was issued in response to Garland’s October 4th memo and “entirely misstates the law.”
Senator Hawley wrote,
“When you testified last week about your October 4th memo directing the FBI to involve itself with parents protesting at local school boards, you told me that you were concerned only with violence and threats of violence. I did not believe you. It is now clear that neither did the people who work for you. The head federal prosecutor in at least one state has now publicly directed law enforcement to go after parents for conduct that—without question—is not criminal.”
On October 27th, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Garland denied knowledge of the Montana memo when
questioned about it by Senator Hawley.

or below.
November 1, 2021
The Honorable Merrick Garland
Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Garland:
When you testified last week about your October 4th memo directing the FBI to involve itself with parents protesting at local school boards, you told me that you were concerned only with violence and threats of violence. I did not believe you. It is now clear that neither did the people who work for you. The head federal prosecutor in at least one state has now publicly directed law enforcement to go after parents for conduct that—without question—is not criminal.
The U.S. Attorney in Montana, who serves under your watch, issued a memo on October 14th directing law enforcement to “contact the FBI” if a parent calls a member of a school board “with intent to annoy.” Calling a person “with intent to annoy,” he said, “may serve as a basis for a prosecution” under federal law. This memo was published in local media for all parents to see. [
1
]
That memo entirely misstates the law. No federal law prohibits calling a school board member “with intent to annoy.” Although that language previously appeared in a criminal statute, Congress repealed it nearly a decade ago—no doubt out of a concern that prosecutors in your Department would use that language to try to chill speech. Your Department even sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Montana to “highlight” this change. [
2
] Yet prosecutors under your watch, nearly a decade later, are falsely telling parents that they can be prosecuted if a member of a school board thinks the parents intended to be annoying. I can think of nothing that has a greater tendency to chill free speech of parents.
You professed not to know about this memo when you appeared before the Senate last week. But it was entirely predictable that your head prosecutors would use your October 4th memo to go after parents for making their voices heard. Indeed, the U.S. Attorney in Montana said he was issuing his memo “pursuant to the Attorney General’s directive” of October 4th. This makes it especially galling that, even though Senator after Senator highlighted this issue for you last week, you simply doubled down and insisted that the memo clearly protected First Amendment activity. Your assertion is patently false. Your interpretation was not shared by the hundreds of parents who have contacted their congressional offices to complain, and it was not shared by your own lead prosecutor in Montana. To prevent further chilling of speech, you must immediately withdraw your October 4th memo and apologize.
Before November 5, please provide my office with a copy of every memo any official in the Department of Justice has issued in response to your October 4th memo.
I await the Department’s response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Continues to Stand with Taiwan, Introducing New Bill to Help Nation Arm Itself
Date: Tuesday, November 02, 2021

Content:
New legislation establishes Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative, accelerates Taiwan’s deployment of asymmetric defenses
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) – a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee – introduced the
Arm Taiwan Act of 2021
to strengthen Taiwan’s defenses against a Chinese invasion. It does so by allocating $3 billion annually for a new Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of asymmetric defense capabilities. It also conditions future conventional arms sales on Taiwan’s progress preparing its military and fielding the weapons required to defeat China’s war plans.
“Taiwan is in grave danger, but the future is not yet written,”
said Senator Hawley.
“The Arm Taiwan Act will ensure Taiwan has the asymmetric defenses it needs to deter a Chinese invasion – so long as Taiwan is prepared to make the difficult choices required to defend itself in the hard years ahead.
“We should do everything in our power to help Taiwan urgently strengthen its defenses. If China’s recent actions have shown the world anything, it’s that Beijing will stop at nothing in its quest to dominate the Indo-Pacific and then the world. We must not let them succeed.”
The Arm Taiwan Act of 2021 comes amidst a
surge in Chinese military threats
and warnings by U.S. and
Taiwanese officials that China
may try to invade Taiwan in the next few years.
Senator Hawley has been a strong supporter of Taiwan throughout his time in the Senate. Earlier this year, he reintroduced the
Taiwan Defense Act
with several cosponsors, which would make it U.S. policy to maintain the ability to defeat a Chinese fait accompli against Taiwan. Senator Hawley has also spoken on
the Senate floor
and
elsewhere
about the threat posed by Chinese imperialism in Americans’ lives, livelihoods, and freedoms.
BACKGROUND
The military balance in the Taiwan Strait is rapidly deteriorating. As a result, there is growing concern that China may conclude that it can, or actually be able to, invade and seize control of Taiwan by the late 2020s. One of the most effective ways to slow – or potentially even halt or reverse – this deterioration is to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense capabilities, including mobile coastal and air defenses, naval mines, missile boats, man-portable anti-armor weapons, civil defense forces, and their enablers.
These capabilities can have a disproportionate effect on the cross-Strait military balance because they are designed to deny Chinese forces’ ability to achieve air superiority over Taiwan, deliver airborne or amphibious forces to Taiwan, and seize and hold Taiwanese territory. These capabilities are also difficult to target and neutralize by virtue of their mobility, concealability, and numbers, which will allow Taiwanese forces to fight longer and more effectively, especially in the initial period of war, when U.S. forces may be able to provide only limited support.
It is therefore imperative that Taiwan field cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense capabilities as quickly as possible – and the United States has a strong interest in helping them do so. The United States also has an interest, however, in ensuring any such assistance is as effective as possible and that Taiwan is doing its part to strengthen its defenses with the urgency required.
That is why any assistance provided by the United States to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of asymmetric defense capabilities should be conditioned on Taiwan taking key steps related to defense spending, acquisitions, and reform. It is also why any future conventional arms sales to Taiwan should be contingent on Taiwan demonstrating progress toward fielding a credible asymmetric defense.
The
Arm Taiwan Act of 2021
does the following:
Tasks the Secretary of Defense to form the Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative and authorizes $3 billion annually for the Initiative for fiscal years 2023 to 2027.
Specifies how funds authorized for the Initiative should be used, with a specific emphasis on providing Taiwan with equipment, training, and other support required to accelerate Taiwan’s deployment of the asymmetric defense capabilities required to delay, degrade, and deny a Chinese invasion against Taiwan.
Conditions provision of assistance under the Initiative on annual certification that Taiwan is matching U.S. investments in its asymmetric defenses, increasing defense spending, acquiring asymmetric defense capabilities as quickly as possible regardless of source, and implementing defense reforms, especially with regard to Taiwan’s reserve forces.
Conditions the future sale, lease, or other provision of conventional weapons by the United States to Taiwan on demonstrated progress by Taiwan toward fielding a credible asymmetric defense.

Title: Hawley, Kennedy, Colleagues Rebuke Biden Plan to Pay Illegal Immigrants with Taxpayer Dollars
Date: Tuesday, November 02, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Kennedy (R-La.), and the nine other Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans wrote to President Joe Biden to oppose his administration’s
reported plan
to offer illegal immigrants up to $450,000 per person in taxpayer dollars to settle lawsuits resulting from those individuals’ violating U.S. immigration law.
Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) joined Senators Hawley and Kennedy in asking the president to refuse to issue any settlement payments for illegal immigrants who broke U.S. laws.
“At a time when respect for our country’s immigration laws is at an all-time low, our federal government is now seeking to financially reward aliens who broke our laws,”
wrote the senators.
“These illegal immigrants disregarded our immigration processes, cut in front of those seeking to legally enter our nation, and put children at risk of great personal injury or death by placing them in the hands of abusive smugglers. Not only would these settlements be breathtakingly unjust and unwise, but they reinforce the conditions that make it easy for the cartels to recruit more people to undertake the treacherous journey to our southwest border, and serve only to encourage more illegal immigration,”
they continued.
“Americans are a kind and generous people who welcome a diverse array of immigrants from around the world. Our nation has been made stronger by the generations of legal immigrants that have contributed to our country and achieved the American Dream. But rewarding illegal immigration with financial payments runs counter to our laws and would only serve to encourage more lawlessness at our border,
” the senators concluded.

Title: Senator Hawley Delivers National Conservatism Keynote on the Left’s Attack on Men in America
Date: Monday, November 01, 2021

Content:
Last night U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered a keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Fla. He addressed the future of the American man and highlighted the need to strengthen and empower American men so that they can serve as an “unrivaled force for good in the world.”
Speech text as prepared for delivery:
Good evening. It is a pleasure to be with you tonight.
I had the honor to be at your inaugural conference two years ago. After that speech, the Left called me a racist, a fascist, and a Nazi.
So when Yoram invited me to speak again this year, I thought: What’s to lose?
I spoke two years ago of the Left’s ambition to create a world beyond belonging—a world where community and shared culture—our culture—count for little. It’s part of the Left’s effort to fundamentally remake America.
I want to talk with you tonight about another aspect of that ambition. I want to talk with you about the Left’s attempt to give us a world beyond men.
We meet at a time of reckoning. As we speak, the Left controls the commanding heights of American society. They have the White House, the House of Representatives, the Senate. Their voices predominate in the news media, in Hollywood, arguably sports, and of course, at our universities.
This is their hour. And they are determined to use it.
The Left know what they believe. They believe that America is a systemically racist, structurally oppressive, hopelessly patriarchal kind of place. It’s a dystopia, if only Americans would get woke enough to see it. It’s a nation that needs to be taught how unjust it truly is and after that, rebuilt from top to bottom.
That’s the Leftist project, and that’s their grand ambition: to deconstruct America.
This work of deconstruction is what unites today’s Left and binds together all their various preoccupations, from critical race theory to their economic socialism to their bizarre war on women’s sports.
But what I want you to notice, what I want to call out tonight, is this fact: that the deconstruction of America begins with and depends on the deconstruction of American men.
The Left want to define traditional masculinity as toxic. They want to define the traditional masculine virtues—things like courage, and independence, and assertiveness—as a danger to society.
This is an effort the Left has been at for years now. And they have had // alarming success. American men are working less, getting married in fewer numbers; they’re fathering fewer children. They are suffering more anxiety and depression. They are engaging in more substance abuse.
Many men in this country are in crisis, and their ranks are swelling.
And that’s not just a crisis for men. It’s a crisis for the republic.
Because the problem with the Left’s assault on the masculine virtues is that those self-same qualities, the very ones the Left now vilify as dangerous and toxic, have long been regarded as vital to self-government.
Observers from the ancient Romans to our forefathers identified the manly virtues as indispensable for political liberty.
Now maybe they were wrong and today’s Left is right. Maybe virtue isn’t needed for liberty. Or maybe the only necessary virtues are the modern liberal ones of tolerance, and compliance, and I suppose, consumption. Maybe all you need to be a good citizen after all is to be a good consumer.
But it doesn’t look that way. It’s hard to argue that our democracy is in better shape now than it was thirty or forty years ago. It’s hard to believe that our liberty is now more secure.
It’s hard to accept that the pathologies gripping so many American men are good for American society. I’d contend just the opposite.
Now this is not to say that American women aren’t central to this story, far from it. American women have shaped our culture every bit as much as men, and their virtues are every bit as necessary to the success of our republic.
And indeed, the Left is carrying out its own assault on womanhood, and on the very idea of gender.
Many of my Democrat colleagues in the Senate won’t even say the word “mother” any more, for heaven’s sake. “Birthing people” is the term of choice, as if women don’t exist.
And leftwing advocates across the country are trying to destroy women’s sports, as if women and men are somehow interchangeable.
All that too is part of the deconstructionist agenda.
But I want to focus tonight on the deconstruction of men, not because men are more important, but because I believe the attack on men has been the tip of the spear of the Left’s broader attack on America. And because this attack on men is already far advanced.
But even as I describe the danger, there is cause for hope. For while the Left’s assault on manhood has been sharp and prolonged, it has not yet succeeded. And we must make it our aim as conservatives to see that it does not succeed.
More than that, we must seek a revival of strong and healthy manhood in America. We need men who will shoulder responsibility, men who will start and provide for families, men who will enter the covenant of marriage and then honor it.
We need men to raise up sons and daughters after them, to pass on the great truths of our culture and history, to defend liberty, to share in the work of self-government.
We need the kind of men who make republics possible.
And it is not too much to say that our ability to get that kind of men will determine the success of our long experiment in liberty.
***
Let me start by pressing home this point. The Left’s attack on America leads directly to an attack on manhood.
For years now, Democrats and other leftists have insisted that American society is systemically oppressive, systemically evil and unjust. They’ve said it so much and so often that to them, it’s become a truism. It’s become the very cornerstone of their worldview.
Just listen to the President of the United States. Joe Biden has, as president, repeatedly referred to America’s “systemic racism.” His Administration has loudly called for a new “gender equity” agenda to right the structural injustices of our society.
His nominees have advocated critical race theory and training in “equity” for federal workers.
This past week the Administration celebrated the introduction of an “X” gender marker on American passports. X means neither male nor female, if you’re keeping up.
All this points to how important the deconstructionist agenda is to Team Biden and to the Left. Inflation is rampant, store shelves are bare, but the Administration won’t be distracted from what truly matters, exposing just how bad America is.
Other prominent liberals have taken the next step and identified America’s many alleged woes with men in particular.
Take Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. “White supremacy and patriarchy are linked in a lot of ways,” she says. Meaning that America’s systemic racism is a systemic problem with men.
Author John Stoltenberg writes that “talking about ‘healthy masculinity’ is like talking about `healthy cancer.’”
Professor Suzanna Walters of Northeastern University says it “seems logical to hate men” unless they “pledge to vote for feminist women only” and “don’t run for office.”
Now this line of thinking is hardly new. The critical theory of deconstruction runs back to mid-century intellectuals like Jacques Derrida and Herbert Marcuse; and farther back to the Frankfurt School of the 1930s; and back farther still to Marx.
Nor is it new to blame men for society’s ills. Marcuse in particular is interesting in this regard. He was one of the leading lights of the 1960s counter-culture, and he thought Marx was right to call western society structurally oppressive, but wrong to see that oppression as principally economic.
No, the really oppressive thing about American society, he said, was culture.
And while Marx pinned his hopes on working class men, the proletariat, Marcuse saw those same men as the problem. They were too culturally conservative. Too hidebound. Too traditional.
Marcuse concluded the revolution would only come from the well-educated elite, who could see beyond mirages like manhood.
Which brings us back to today’s American Left. They’ve swallowed this theory whole and they are delivering this message from every platform where they have power. Which is most everywhere.
University curricula abound with seminars on masculinity and its defects. To take but one sample of what’s on offer, consider Professor David Cohen of Drexel Kline School of Law: “Traditional masculinity,” he says, “has oppressed girls and women and limited the identity construction of all boys and men.”
A seminar at Williams College, called “Performing Masculinity in Global Popular Culture,” asks “Why must masculinity be the purview of males at all?” Answering that question will cost you $75,000 a year.
Even our military academies are in on the act. West Point reportedly held mandatory events last year addressing “gender norms,” including “toxic masculinity.” One cadet said afterwards, “I’m being taught how not to be a man.”
Men are getting the message. They’re leaving higher education in record numbers. I suspect you’ve seen the recent Wall Street Journal reporting: Women now make up 60 percent of college students; men, 40 percent. Experts predict a 2:1 ratio soon, with the trend sped up by the pandemic.
But the message of toxic masculinity is not only in the academy. It’s in our grade schools, where boys are increasingly treated like an illness in search of a cure. If boys are too rambunctious, they’re diagnosed with hyperactivity disorder and medicated into submission.
Hollywood delivers the toxic masculinity theme ad nauseum in television and film.
And our expert class amplifies it. The American Psychological Association now advises that “conforming to traditional masculinity ideology has been shown to limit males’ psychological development … and negatively influence mental health and physical health.” Manhood is a disease to be defeated.
The Left delivers the same message in the press, through the corporations, and through advertising. Gillette infamously ran an ad campaign for its razors in 2019 that included this voice-over: “Bullying … MeToo movement against sexual harassment … toxic masculinity … is this the best a man can get?”
And the Left is writing this same men-are-the-problem mantra into policy.
Working class men have been a particular target for this Administration. President Biden’s illegal vaccine mandate on private citizens puts millions of working class men squarely in the cross hairs. Shut up, get the jab, or get lost.
Nevermind these are the very people hailed as “essential workers” not twelve months ago. Not anymore. Now they’re expendable. Now they’re the problem.
But the Left has been pursuing its attack on men through policy for longer than the last year, and sometimes with the help of Republicans.
Over the last thirty years and more, government policy has helped destroy the kind of economy that gave meaning to generations of men.
Domestic manufacturing once supported millions of American men with good wages, who in turn started and supported families. Now that industry lies all but dead on the altar of globalism.
At the same time, advancing consolidation has made it almost impossible for family farmers to compete against multinational firms.
The result is fewer and fewer men working. And I don’t mean the elderly or disabled, I mean prime-aged, able-bodied men.
Since 1965, the number of adult men between the ages of twenty and sixty-four not working—not even looking for work, but completely and totally out of the labor force—has quintupled, soaring from 3 million in the 1960s to more than 16 million in 2015.
And the less men work, the less they marry.
Marriage rates are plummeting. And the age of first marriage continues to rise, as men push commitment off further and further into the future.
By 2010, a majority of men in this country between 25 and 34 had never married. And that trend has accelerated since.
Fewer marriages means fewer fathers in the home. By 2020, over 18 million American children lived without a father present. That’s more than a quarter of all children in America. And I probably don’t need to remind you that an absent father is strongly correlated with increased childhood poverty, childhood depression, and poor academic performance. …
I am not here tonight to tell you that men are victims. The last thing we need more of in this country is the victim mindset. And men who blame others for their problems and then slink away to do nothing, or worse, who embrace violence or cruelty, deserve rebuke.
Responsibility is one of God’s greatest gifts to mankind, and men must be held responsible for their actions.
Still … can we be surprised that after years of being told they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness, and pornography, and video games.
I found the comment by one young man to the Wall Street Journal particularly evocative, and particularly heartbreaking. He said, “I’m sort of waiting for a light to come on so I can figure out what to do next.” I suspect he speaks for many.
And while the Left may celebrate this decline of men, I for one cannot join them. No one should.
The crisis of American men is a crisis for the American republic.
It’s not just that millions of men out of work slows our innovation and economic growth.
It’s not just the billions of dollars in welfare payments these idle men cost the federal fisc year on year.
It’s not only the depression and darkness that now shadow so many.
It’s that liberty requires virtue. And in particular, it requires the manly virtues.
America needs good men. …
The liberty of a republic is a demanding thing.
To keep a republic, you have to be willing to fight for it.
To share in self-government, you have to stand strong against those who would try to make you dependent on their wealth or influence.
To preserve liberty, you have to discipline your passions and sacrifice in the service of others.
For centuries, lovers of liberty have praised these qualities as the highest standard of manhood. That’s not to say that women don’t possess them. But it is to say that these virtues are the bright side of the aggression and competitiveness and independence that psychologists, no less than philosophers, have long observed in men.
Assertiveness and independence are strengths when used to protect and empower others.
Want an example? Look no further than those dads at Southwood High School in Shreveport, Louisiana. The ones who just by showing up, calmed the fighting and changed the atmosphere of an entire campus. As one student said to a reporter, “Dads have the power to do that.”
Every republic needs those kind of men.
The question is, how are we going to raise up good men today?
We can start by repudiating the lie that America is a systemically oppressive nation and that men are systemically responsible.
It is a fantasy, it is a folly, it is a falsehood and we should call it out for what it is.
America may be an imperfect place, but it is the most noble experiment in liberty the world has ever seen, for the poor and the rich alike, for men and for women, for black and for white.
And though we have struggled to live up to our ideals—and failed, and risen to struggle again—there is honor in the struggle, and we are still, even now, the last best, hope on earth.
And we must tell the men of this nation that their struggle, too, is noble and that they are needed.
To each man, I say: You can be a tremendous force for good. Your nation needs you. The world needs you.
Your strength can liberate others. Your power can serve those in need. Your creativity can light new paths. Your courage can defend the weak. Your faithfulness can raise up sons and daughters after you and make their way straight. You can make this a more perfect nation.
We must say this to men of our society from the time they are small, and teach it to them in our classrooms and in our homes and in our churches.
And we must do more.
We must rebuild an economy in this country in which men can thrive. And that means rebuilding those manufacturing and production sectors that so much of the chattering class has written off as relics of the past.
In this country, we are more than mere consumers. We have been the makers of great and mighty things, and we shall be again.
The DC experts will say it’s impossible; better to outsource our production to China or Mexico or other places where labor is cheap. But free labor and slave labor should never be put on an even plane. And it is free labor worthy of free men that we are after.
Theodore Roosevelt once said, “I am for business, but I am for manhood first, and business as an adjunct to manhood.” He was right then, and that sentiment should be our watchword today.
We must make every effort to restore a vibrant manufacturing sector in this country that can employ working men at living wages—wages that can feed a family, and support a community. And we can start by requiring that at least half of all goods and supplies critical for our national security be made in the United States.
Speaking of communities, those begin with the family, and we must make the family the center of political life.
We should be clear in the message we send about family and unapologetic: There is no higher calling, and no greater duty, than raising a family. And we should encourage all men to pursue it.
To that end, I believe the time has come for explicit rewards in our tax code for marriage. Forget the marriage penalty. There should be a marriage bonus. And we should allow the parents of young children to keep more of their own money as well. …
The Left is telling America and its men, you’re evil. You’re terrible. You must apologize and submit to your government masters to be reformed.
I suggest we offer a different theme, one that goes like this. … America is yet that city on a hill, and the eyes of the world are yet upon us, looking to us for hope.
American men are and can be an unrivaled force for good in the world—if we can strengthen them, if we can empower them, if we can unleash them to be who they are made to be.
Then they shall, in the words of Scripture, “build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former desolations; they shall repair the ruined cities, [and] the devastations of many generations.”
God bless you. Good night.

Title: Senator Hawley Leads Effort to Remove NDAA Provision Forcing Women to Enter Draft
Date: Monday, November 01, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will introduce an
amendment
to the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week to remove the provision requiring women to register for the Selective Service System.
“It is wrong to force our daughters, mothers, wives, and sisters to fight our wars,”
said Senator Hawley. “Our country is extremely grateful for the brave women who have volunteered to serve our country with and alongside our fighting forces. They have played a vital role in defending America at every point in our nation’s history. But volunteering for military service is not the same as being forced into it, and no woman should be compelled to do so.”
In July, Senator Hawley
voted
against the Senate Democrats’
proposal
requiring women to register for the draft when the issue came before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Title: Hawley Op-ed in NYT: The Only Way to Solve Our Supply Chain Crisis Is to Rethink Trade
Date: Friday, October 29, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has published an op-ed in the
New York Times
on America’s supply crisis and his new bill to fix it, the
Make in America to Sell in America Act
:
The failure of the nation’s productive capacity to keep up with its needs was not inevitable. It was a choice. Over the last 30 years, experts and politicians in Washington from both parties helped build a global economic system that prioritized the free flow of capital over the wages of American workers, and the free flow of goods over the resiliency of our nation’s supply chains. We liberalized and expanded trade relations with China under the delusion that it could be influenced into becoming a peace-loving democracy. We ceded more and more of our national sovereignty to multinational organizations like the World Trade Organization, and supported China’s membership to that body.
The consequences of these bad policies have been disastrous. They’ve created trade patterns that have helped multinational corporations boost their profits by exploiting cheap labor abroad and offshoring America’s industrial commons and the capabilities of its manufacturing sector. As a result, thousands of factories have shuttered, millions of jobs have been shipped overseas and the economic security of the United States is now more vulnerable to unpredictable crises like global pandemics, and America is dangerously dependent on the productive capacity of China, our chief adversary. These policies were sold to us as a path to greater wealth, but they’ve made us weaker and more vulnerable.
The global pandemic has exposed this system for what it is — a failure. When our
supply chains collapse
like a house of cards during a surge in demand, our trade deficit reaches a
record high
and our nation faces a shortage of critical inputs like semiconductors and life-saving
pharmaceutical drugs, alarm bells should sound.
But President Biden seems determined to repeat the follies of the past. His administration acts as if we must embrace lower expectations and that America must come to accept that unstable supply and volatile prices are unavoidable. As if we are too weak to do otherwise.
That’s wrong. America is a strong nation. We should start acting like one. While distribution problems are a factor right now in the crisis, structural reforms are imperative to reassert our economic independence. We need to fundamentally restructure our country’s trade policy and decouple our security and safety from the profit-seeking of multinational corporations. I’m
proposing new legislation
to take a big first step: the Make in America to Sell in America Act.

Title: Hawley Rips Garland Over Attempt to Weaponize FBI Against Parents, Calls for His Resignation
Date: Wednesday, October 27, 2021

Content:
Today at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) ripped Attorney General Merrick Garland over his attempt to weaponize the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against parents and called for his resignation.
Senator Hawley questioned the Attorney General on a memo from the District of Montana U.S. Attorney’s office outlining federal causes of action prosecutors may bring against parents and encouraging prosecutors to involve the FBI. Garland insisted he was not aware of the memo and had not seen it before the hearing.
Senator Hawley said,
“I’ll leave it at this, General Garland. You have weaponized the FBI and the Department of Justice, your U.S. attorneys are now collecting and cataloging all the ways that they might prosecute parents like Mr. Smith because they want to be involved in their children’s education and they want to have a say in their elected officials. It’s wrong, it is unprecedented to my knowledge in the history of this country, and I call on you to resign.”

Title: Hawley Questions Biden DOD on Email Obtained Alleging Failure to Vet Hundreds of Thousands of Afghan Evacuees
Date: Tuesday, October 26, 2021

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned U.S. Department of Defense Under Secretary for Defense Policy Colin Kahl on allegations that the Biden administration failed to properly vet hundreds of thousands of Afghan evacuees during the fall of Kabul. Reading from
an email shared with him
by an American official present during the evacuation, Senator Hawley questioned Under Secretary Kahl on Biden administration directives to prioritize filling planes over vetting evacuees and to “err on the side of excess.”
“What I’m driving at is, we know that we’ve got major problems of vetting of the people who were brought to this country, who were evacuated and brought to this country,”
said Senator Hawley.
“So, you testified in September that those evacuated, about 6,000 American citizens, you testified in September that the SIVs were about 1,200 to 1,300, that leaves about 116,700 people, based on the 124,000 neo-number that you’ve been offering, 116,700 who were not citizens, who were not SIVs, and we just don’t know much about who were those people?”
NEWS: This email was shared w/ me by an American official present jn Afghanistan during the evacuation who was shocked by Administration’s failure to vet Afghans before they were evacuated. Email details orders from Joe Biden to fill up the planes – even without vetting

Title: Hawley Joins Tim Scott Effort to Block Democrats’ IRS Snooping Proposal
Date: Friday, October 22, 2021

Content:
President Joe Biden’s administration recently unveiled a
proposal
that would allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to gain access to virtually every working American’s financial information by requiring financial institutions to report account data to the IRS for anyone whose transactions total at least $10,000 over the course of one year. In response, this week U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and 46 of his colleagues cosponsored Tim Scott’s (R-S.C.) “
Prohibiting IRS Financial Surveillance Act,” a bill to prevent the IRS from implementing the Democrat-endorsed plan to give the agency access to transaction information of virtually every American.
“Joe Biden and the Democrats want to snoop on the finances of everyday Americans,”
said Senator Hawley. “They want to give the same IRS that has a history of targeting conservatives new surveillance powers to oversee the bank accounts of working families and farmers across the country. This is liberal power-grab with no possible justification.”
Under Biden’s IRS reporting regime, a family whose monthly expenses total just $833 would still be required to be reported to the IRS. That means nearly every American, even those below the poverty line, would be subject to this proposed reporting regime. The Joint Committee on Taxation has analyzed the proposal and found that it is likely to impact taxpayers in every income bracket, including those making less than $50,000.
“The Democrats’ plan to allow the IRS to spy on the bank accounts of nearly every person in this country, even those below the poverty line, should be deeply concerning to anyone who values privacy and economic inclusion,”
said Senator Tim Scott. “Of the more than 7 million American households that are currently unbanked, the majority are low-income, rural, and minority Americans. Implementing the Biden reporting scheme will disproportionately harm those who need greater access to our financial institutions and people living paycheck to paycheck. My colleagues and I will not stop fighting the Democrats’ wrong-headed proposal to implement more federal government intrusion into our lives.”

Title: Hawley Introduces New Bill to Curb Supply Crisis, Revitalize American Manufacturing
Date: Wednesday, October 20, 2021

Content:
In light of the
supply crisis gripping the nation, today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Make in America to Sell in America Act,
a bold new economic agenda to revitalize American manufacturing while securing critical supply chains. Senator Hawley’s bill would require multi-national corporations make more critical goods in America by instituting new local content requirements to boost new investment in domestic manufacturing.
In August, the U.S. trade deficit
reached a record high. Foreign imports from countries like China are surging, all while global supply chains are breaking down, goods are
backlogged at our seaports, and
new shortages
are
sweeping the nation. Senator Hawley’s bill would end this dangerous overreliance on foreign factories to help ensure a supply crisis never happens again.
Senator Hawley said,
“Joe Biden’s supply chain crisis is getting worse with every passing day, straining the finances of working Americans who have already been forced to endure so much over the past year and a half. Biden’s policies have given us empty shelves and rising prices across the country. It’s past time for the U.S. to end its crippling dependency on foreign manufacturing in countries like China and ensure that we actually produce the goods we need here at home.”
Full text of the
Make in America to Sell in America Act
can be found
here.
Background
The
Make in America to Sell in America Act
will:
Direct the Department of Commerce (DOC), in consultation with the Department of Defense (DOD), to produce an annual report that identifies finished and intermediate manufactured goods that are critical for the national security of the United States or the protection of the industrial base of the United States.
Require that the goods identified by DOC and DOD be subject to a local content requirement of over 50 percent, meaning that over 50 percent of the value of the good must be produced in the United States in order to be sold commercially in the United States. These requirements would go into effect three years after enactment.
Enforce these requirements similar to anti-dumping duties, whereby domestic manufacturers can petition the International Trade Commission and DOC for enforcement actions against importers of goods that fail to meet the new standards.

Title: Senator Hawley: Biden Vaccine Mandate Shows Contempt for Religious Liberty, Rescind Guidance Immediately
Date: Tuesday, October 19, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to co-chairs of the Safer Federal Workforce Taskforce – the Office of Personnel Management Director, Kiran Ahuja; General Services Administrator, Robin Carnahan; and Covid-19 Response Coordinator, Jeff Zients – demanding answers on President Biden’s vaccine mandate, which fails to provide adequate safeguards for the sincerely held religious beliefs of federal employees and displays clear contempt for religious liberty.
President Biden’s vaccine mandate guidance acknowledges that federal law requires individuals with sincerely held religious beliefs to be exempt from vaccine mandates. But the guidance also allows agencies to fire employees despite valid exemptions if “the nature of the employee’s job may be such that an agency determines that no safety protocol other than vaccination is adequate.”
“This contempt for religious liberty is confirmed by new forms you have circulated ‘for employees who are seeking an exception […] based on religion,”
writes Senator Hawley. “This
template
goes on to require that applicants list ‘How long have you held the religious belief underlying your objection,’ as well as a complete history of vaccines received and the specific objections to each of these. The complete list of seven questions evinces a skepticism and indeed a hostility to applicants who harbor sincerely held religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccine. I fear this will chill applications by civil servants to apply for religious exemptions.”
He continues, “Further, the guidance appears to mandate vaccines for ‘people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to become pregnant now, or trying to become pregnant in the future’—what we used to call expecting mothers. The inclusion of woke language like this undermines the credibility of this guidance and suggests that it is part of an effort to the target religious, conservative, and other civil service employees who do not subscribe to the far-left agenda.”
Senator Hawley has called for the guidance to be rescinded immediately and replaced with clear accommodations for all civil service employees who hold sincerely held religious beliefs. New guidance should make clear that “no federal employee will lose his job because of his sincerely held religious convictions.”

Director Kiran Ahuja
Office of Personnel Management
Co-Chair Safer Federal Workforce Task Force
Administrator Robin Carnahan
General Services Administration
Co-Chair Safer Federal Workforce Task Force
Jeff Zients
Assistant to the President
Counselor to the President
Covid-19 Response Coordinator
Co-Chair Safer Federal Workforce Task Force
Co-Chairs Ahuja, Carnahan, and Zients,
I write with concern over the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force’s (“Task Force”) latest guidance implementing President Biden’s vaccinate mandate for all federal employees. At best, they fail to provide adequate safeguards for the sincerely held beliefs of federal employees. At worst, they suggest a skepticism and contempt for religious beliefs. The guidance is also overbroad and riddled with woke propaganda. It should be withdrawn immediately.
On October 4, 2021, the Task Force which you co-chair issued updated guidance that finally addressed applications by federal employees for religious exemptions from President Biden’s vaccine mandate. Shortly after these were issued, there were reports that “although the president’s mandate that all federal employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 allows for some religious and medical exemptions, agencies may still fire employees with otherwise valid exemptions if the employees are in certain types of jobs where no other safety protocol would be sufficient.”
Upon inspection, this certainly appears to be the case. The guidance correctly acknowledges that federal law requires individuals with sincerely held religious beliefs to be exempt from vaccine mandates. But the guidance then contemplates that “In some cases, the nature of the employee’s job may be such that an agency determines that no safety protocol other than vaccination is adequate. In such circumstances, the agency may deny the requested accommodation.” In other words, even “[i]f an employee is not fully vaccinated due to a legally required exception,” that employee may be fired or vaccinated against his will.
This contempt for religious liberty is confirmed by new forms you have circulated “for employees who are seeking an exception … based on religion.” These correctly provide an applicant with the opportunity to describe the nature of his or her objection and how it substantially burdens the free exercise of his or her religion. But this template goes on to require that applicants list “How long have you held the religious belief underlying your objection,” as well as a complete history of vaccines received and the specific objections to each of these. The complete list of seven questions evinces a skepticism and indeed a hostility to applicants who harbor sincerely held religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccine. I fear this will chill applications by civil servants to apply for religious exemptions.
The Task Force’s guidance is also palpably overbroad. For example, it provides that “[A]ll Federal employees … without a legally required exception need to be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, regardless of where they are working.” Improbably, “[e]mployees who are … working remotely are not excused from this requirement, including because employees working offsite may interact with the public as part of their duties.”
Further, the guidance appears to mandate vaccines for “people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to become pregnant now, or trying to become pregnant in the future”—what we used to call expecting mothers. The inclusion of woke language like this undermines the credibility of this guidance and suggests that it is part of an effort to the target religious, conservative, and other civil service employees who do not subscribe to the far-left agenda.
The latest guidance should be rescinded immediately and replaced with clear accommodations for all civil service employees who hold sincerely held beliefs. At the very least, it should make clear that no federal employee will lose his job because of his sincerely held religious convictions.
So that Congress can evaluate remedial legislation, please provide the following information by November 1, 2021.
What analysis have you or other agencies conducted to ensure that the updated guidance is valid under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106-274, 114 Stat. 803 (2000) (codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq.). Please provide all such documentation.
Has the executive branch previously required applicants for religious exemptions to provide a complete list of their vaccination history? If not, when was this change made and by what office?
How many requests by federal employees for religious exemptions from the vaccinate mandate have been denied thus far?
How many employees with valid religious exemptions have been determined to hold a type of job where “no other safety protocol would be sufficient”?
If an employee is determined to have a valid religious exemption but holds a type of job where “no other safety protocol would be sufficient,” under your latest guidance, what are the consequences for that employee?
a. Are they subject to being fired, transferred, or receiving some other       adverse employment action?
b. What protections are in place to ensure that their sincerely held religious beliefs are being appropriate accommodated?
Why are individuals working remotely required to be vaccinated?
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Answers on Airlines’ use of Pandemic Funds, Widespread Layoffs from Biden Vaccine Mandate
Date: Monday, October 18, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, Brian D. Miller, and acting Inspector General Richard K. Delmar urging an investigation into the widespread layoffs of airline workers who declined to submit themselves to President Biden’s vaccine mandate and the potential misuse of CARES Act funds by airlines.
Senator Hawley writes, “The Congress provided unprecedented funds to airlines and other companies during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the condition that they did not lay off their employees.  Yet according to recent reports, some airlines have been laying off employees who decline to submit themselves to President Biden’s vaccine mandate.  This has led to many employees losing their jobs… I now write to call on you to immediately open a complete investigation into the widespread layoffs by major airline companies and legal review of whether these companies violated the terms of their loans.”
In addition to the investigation into funding misuses, Senator Hawley is demanding answers on which airlines took adverse actions against unvaccinated employees and if any airlines delayed or cancelled flights as a result of employee vaccination-related issues.
In May of 2020, Senator Hawley
wrote a letter
to United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz demanding the company reverse their decision to cut 15,000 employees’ hours or return the generous taxpayer-funded bailout it received from the CARES Act.

Richard K. Delmar
Acting Inspector General
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Inspector General Miller and Acting Inspector General Delmar,
The Congress provided unprecedented funds to airlines and other companies during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the condition that they did not lay off their employees. Yet according to recent reports, some airlines have been laying off employees who decline to submit themselves to President Biden’s vaccine mandate. This has led to many employees losing their jobs.
Under the CARES Act, your offices have jurisdiction to audit and investigate loans from the Department of the Treasury to these airline companies. I appreciate your inclusion of these loans in your reports to Congress so far.
I now write to call on you to immediately open a complete investigation into the widespread layoffs by major airline companies and legal review of whether these companies violated the terms of their loans. This review is especially timely as a federal court recently issued a temporary restraining order against United Airlines from implementing its mandatory vaccine policy.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that I have expressed my concern with airlines’ receipt of pandemic funds. In May 2020, I wrote to United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz about reports that he was cutting pay for workers after receiving CARES Act funds. I continue to believe that decision should be subject to renewed scrutiny for compliance with the CARES Act.
So that Congress can consider remedial legislation, I also request the following information by November 15, 2021:
Which airlines took adverse actions against employees who failed to submit to President Biden’s vaccine mandate?
Have any of these airlines delayed or canceled flights as a result of their failure to accommodate employees’ applications for medical or religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine?
Did any of these airlines violate the terms of their loans under the CARES Act, and if so, what steps were taken to recover these funds?
What additional jurisdiction or appropriations do you need to fulfill your mission?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley, Colleagues to Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Stop Big Tech Abuses
Date: Friday, October 15, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues led by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) will introduce a new bill to crack down on Big Tech monopolies that abuse their power to favor their own products.
The
American Innovation and Choice Online Act
will set clear rules to protect small businesses on dominant platforms and strengthen the ability of antitrust enforcers to hold such platforms accountable.
Senator Hawley said,
“For too long, Big Tech has run roughshod over small businesses, and lax antitrust enforcers have refused to do anything. No more. Congress is finally beginning to take these issues seriously. This bill will outlaw much of the discrimination and self-preferencing that tech companies currently get away with.”
This bill is also cosponsored by Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Mark Warner (D-Va). A bipartisan group led by House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) and Ranking Member Ken Buck (R-CO) introduced a similar version of the bill in the House, which was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee.
Background
The
American Innovation and Choice Online Act
will:
Set clear, effective rules to protect competition and users doing business on dominant online platforms, including:
Prohibiting dominant platforms from abusing their gatekeeper power by favoring their own products or services, disadvantaging rivals, or discriminating among businesses that use their platforms in a manner that would materially harm competition on the platform; and
Prohibiting specific forms of conduct that are harmful to small businesses, entrepreneurs, and consumers, but that do not have any pro-competitive benefit, including:
Preventing another business’s product or service from interoperating with the dominant platform or another business;
Requiring a business to buy a dominant platform’s goods or services for preferred placement on its platform;
Misusing a business’s data to compete against them; and
Biasing search results in favor of the dominant firm.
Give antitrust enforcers strong, flexible tools to deter violations and hold dominant platforms accountable when they cross the line into illegal behavior, including significant civil penalties, authority to seek broad injunctions, emergency interim relief, and potential forfeiture of executive compensation.
Prevent self-preferencing and discriminatory conduct by the most economically significant online platforms with large U.S. user bases which function as “critical trading partners” for online businesses. For such platforms, the rules target harmful conduct, allowing the platforms to innovate, do business, and engage in pro-consumer conduct, including protecting user privacy and safety, preventing unlawful behavior, and maintaining a secure online experience for users.

Senator Hawley said, “All I can say is this is truly extraordinary. I think you know it is. It’s unprecedented and you can’t point to a single instance where anything like this has happened before. And I think parents across this country are going to be stunned to learn, stunned, that if they show up at a local school board meeting, where they have the right to vote, and you are attempting to intimidate them, you are attempting to silence them, you are attempting to interfere with their rights as parents and, yes, with their rights as voters. This is wrong. This is dangerous. And I cannot believe that that an Attorney General of the United States is engaging in this kind of conduct.”

Title: Senator Hawley and Colleagues Introduce Bill Establishing Select Committee to Investigate Afghanistan Withdrawal
Date: Tuesday, October 05, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and a group of their Senate colleagues
introduced a bill
to establish a bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Afghanistan, composed of members of the House and Senate, to conduct a full investigation into President Biden’s failed and tragic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan that stranded hundreds of Americans behind enemy lines, left billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment in the hands of terrorists, and took the lives of 13 brave U.S. service members. This joint select committee would follow the precedent set in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair.
Last week, Senator Hawley expressed deep frustration
with the Biden administration’s continued finger-pointing
over the Afghanistan withdrawal failures,
demanding that Congress investigate
what went wrong and hold decision makers accountable. Senator Hawley
has gone to the Senate Floor multiple times
about the failed withdrawal and remains committed to
forcing Senators to take individual votes
on Biden nominees for the State Department and Department of Defense until those responsible for the haphazard withdrawal step down.
“The Biden Administration has purposefully obscured the facts around their botched Afghanistan withdrawal that killed 13 American service members and left hundreds of Americans stranded behind enemy lines. The American people deserve answers and the Biden administration seems determined to prevent us from getting them,”
said Senator Hawley. “We need a select committee investigation and public hearings to get to the bottom of this debacle and hold officials accountable.”
Senator Rick Scott said, “Last month, President Biden’s misguided and dangerous decisions in his botched withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan led to the United States most stunning, unforced and humiliating defeat in decades. Due to President Biden’s carelessness and failed leadership, 13 U.S. service members were lost, billions of dollars of U.S. military equipment was left for the Taliban, hundreds of American citizens were stranded behind enemy lines and Afghanistan has been returned to the Taliban and now rests in the hands of the same terrorist-coddling extremists who ruled it on September 11, 2001. The world is now a more dangerous place and the American people are rightfully demanding answers. For over a month, I have called on Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi to launch a bipartisan and bicameral investigation into the Biden administration’s failed withdrawal of American forces. They’ve been shamefully silent. That’s why today, I am introducing a resolution to establish a bipartisan and bicameral Joint Select Committee on Afghanistan to conduct a full investigation and compile a joint report on the United States tragically failed withdrawal from Afghanistan. It’s time to put partisan politics aside and demand accountability.”
Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) also co-sponsored the resolution.

Title: Biden Administration’s Continued Lack of Accountability Leads Hawley to Call for Investigation into Afghanistan Failures
Date: Thursday, September 30, 2021

Content:
Today in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) expressed deep frustration with the
Biden administration’s continued finger-pointing
over the Afghanistan withdrawal failures,
demanding that Congress investigate
what went wrong and hold decision makers accountable.
“We need an investigation right now into what happened here with this evacuation and with this drawdown. We need a Select Committee. We need hearings held in public to get to the bottom of this decision,”
Senator Hawley said.
“What is happening before our eyes here with various officials […] is outrageous when you have 13 service members who are dead, because of decisions that, ultimately, the President of the United States made,”
he continued.
Senator Hawley concluded by saying, “The administration has proved they have no interest in actually getting us the facts. They have misled us at every turn. And if it seems like I’m angry about this, it is because I am. A Missourian is dead because of this. Lance Corporal Schmitz, twelve other service members are dead. Hundreds of civilians are dead. Hundreds of Americans, maybe thousands, are still there. And all we have is the administration officials saying ‘it’s your fault,’ ‘no it’s your fault,’ ‘no it’s your fault.’ It’s the President’s fault, but we need to figure out who in the world advised it, why he made the decisions he made, and I submit to you the time to do that is right now.”
The Senator did not get clear answers during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley when he asked about their timelines for the troop drawdown or who was responsible for what went wrong. He concluded by calling on
both of them to resign
over this crisis.
Senator Hawley has gone to the Senate Floor
multiple times, as recently as this
Tuesday, to talk about the failed withdrawal and remains committed to forcing Senators to take individual votes on Biden nominees for the State Department and Department of Defense until those responsible for the haphazard withdrawal step down.

Title: Hawley Bill to Allow Parents to Sue Big Tech for Harm to Children
Date: Thursday, September 30, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced
new legislation
to make social media companies liable for bodily or mental harm their products cause to children. Senator Hawley’s bill would close the Section 230 loophole protecting these companies and allow parents to sue and obtain damages from social media companies wholly or partly responsible for harm to users under 16.
Senator Hawley said, “Facebook has long had evidence of the harmful effects their products have on children but covered it up because it would hurt their profits. These Big Tech monopolies know exactly how addictive and manipulative their products are but they’re content to rake in billions by exploiting children. Parents need to be given the tools to take back control.”
Senator Hawley’s bill follows
reporting from the
Wall Street Journal
on internal research from Facebook showing the company was aware its products were harmful to children’s mental health but did nothing about it. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Senator Hawley
grilled
Facebook’s Vice President of Privacy and Public Policy over the leaked documents.

Title: Hawley: Biden was Fighting “Phony Culture War” While Americans in Afghanistan Paid the Price
Date: Thursday, September 23, 2021

Content:
On the
Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) lambasted President Joe Biden for waging a “phony culture war” while ignoring the chaos unfolding in Afghanistan as a result of his administration’s failed withdrawal. Senator Hawley also called out Democrats in Congress for looking the other way on Biden’s failed withdrawal, saying he will “force the Senate to actually vote on Joe Biden’s nominees for leadership positions in the Departments of State and Defense. In the face of this crisis, in the face of this debacle, the least the Senate can do is vote.”
During his speech, Sen. Hawley also detailed a timeline of what key administration figures – Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan – were focused on in the weeks leading up to their disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Full remarks can be
seen here, or click the image above.
“They were interested in using the military as a social experiment rather than respecting it as the war fighting institution it was built to be,”
Sen. Hawley said.
“Rather than making decisions that were sound in tactics and sound in strategy, Joe Biden and his team were aiming to please their radical, woke progressive base. And Americans paid the price.”
Sen. Hawley went on to conclude,
“It may be an inconvenience to the Democrat leader, it may be an unwanted responsibility for the supporters of the President, but it is our job nonetheless. Americans have died. Americans have been abandoned. The nation deserves an accounting. And it is not too much to ask the Senate to do its job. It is not too much to ask the Senate to get the truth. And it is not too much to ask the Senate to force accountability for this terrible crisis that this President has disgracefully led us into.”

Title: Hawley, Blunt Resolution Honoring Lance Corporal Schmitz and Fallen Missourians Passes Senate
Date: Thursday, September 23, 2021

Content:
Last night, the Senate passed U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
resolution
honoring Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz of Wentzille, Mo.,  and each of the 56 Missourians who gave their lives during the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) cosponsored the resolution and Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3) introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“Fifty-six Missourians, including Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. They put their love of country and desire to defend American freedom before their own lives,”
said Senator Hawley.
“These brave Missourians embody the best of America and we are eternally grateful for their service. Their legacies will never be forgotten.”
“I join all Americans in mourning the loss of Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz and all of the Missouri service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan,”
said Senator Blunt.
“These heroes did what only the bravest and most extraordinary Americans do: risked their safety to protect and defend our country and the values we stand for. We must do our part, every day, to live a life worthy of their sacrifice – never taking for granted the freedom and security we have because they answered the call to serve.”
Rep. Luetkemeyer said,
“In the wake of the September 11th attacks, Americans from all walks of life enlisted in defense of freedom and for two decades, the United States military fought for us in Afghanistan. During that time, 56 Missourians made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and their spouses, children, parents, grandparents and friends have had to continue living their lives without the people they love the most. We have the privilege of living in a free country because of these incredibly selfless servicemembers and are forever indebted to them and their families for their bravery. Missouri will never be able to repay these families for their service and sacrifice, but we will always remember.”
Senator Hawley introduced the resolution last week during
a speech on the Senator floor.
“I had the privilege of speaking to Lance Corporal Schmitz’s family just hours after we learned of Jared’s death. I said this to them, and I promised that I would say for the whole nation: Jared Schmitz lived a life of honor, he lived a life worth living, and his sacrifice was not in vain,”
Senator Hawley said
in last week’s speech, before reading aloud the names of the 56 Missourians killed in the war in Afghanistan.

Title: Senator Hawley and Colleagues Send Letter to SASC Chairman Demanding More Time to Question Austin, Milley, McKenzie at Hearing Next Week
Date: Wednesday, September 22, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and several colleagues
sent a letter
to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) today in response to concerns that committee members would be capped at one round of five-minute questioning during the long-awaited hearing on the Biden administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, set for next Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2021 on Capitol Hill. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) signed onto the letter, demanding members get more time to question Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and Commander of U.S. Central Command General Kenneth McKenzie next week.
“The Biden administration’s mishandling of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was as disastrous as it was unnecessary,”
the Senators wrote.
They continued by saying the upcoming hearing “offers an opportunity to begin the process of accountability for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. That process can only begin, though, if members are given the time required to ask tough questions of the witnesses before them. We therefore ask for your assurance that members will be allowed to ask at least two rounds of questions during the open portion of the hearing on September 28th.”
This follows a
letter sent by Senators Tuberville, Hawley, and a group of colleagues
earlier this month, demanding more hearings with the Biden administration on the botched execution of their withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of 13 American servicemembers and hundreds of Americans stranded in the war-torn country.
Full text of the letter can be found
here
and below.
September 22, 2021
Honorable Jack Reed
Chairman
Committee on Armed Services
United States Senate
228 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510-6050
Dear Chairman Reed,
We write to request your assurance that members will be allowed to ask at least two rounds of questions during the open portion of the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, and Commander of U.S. Central Command General Kenneth McKenzie on September 28, 2021.
The Biden administration’s mishandling of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was as disastrous as it was unnecessary. For years, we have known that the Afghan security forces would struggle to hold off the Taliban after we withdrew our forces. It should therefore have come as no surprise that the Afghan forces collapsed rapidly following our withdrawal. Yet the Administration failed to plan effectively for this eventuality. Instead, they assumed that the Afghan forces would be able and willing to hold off the Taliban for weeks if not longer after we left. Rather than planning for the worst, they planned for the best – and we have seen the results.
Now it is time for accountability. The American people want to know how the Administration – including the Department of Defense – failed to prepare for the collapse of the Afghan forces and allowed itself to be blindsided by the Taliban’s final advance. They want to know when, why, and by whom the decisions were made that led to thirteen American lives lost, hundreds of Americans stranded behind enemy lines, and tens of thousands of refugees coming to our nation without proper vetting. And they want those responsible to face consequences for their actions.
As members of the Armed Services Committee, it is our duty to ensure the American people get the answers they deserve. But we can only do so if we are allowed to ask multiple rounds of questions during the open portion of the hearing on September 28th. The standard practice of allowing a single five-minute round of questions simply will not provide enough time for members to gather the necessary information. Nor can the opportunity to ask questions in the closed portion of the hearing make up for members’ inability to ask multiple rounds of questions during the open portion, since answers given at the closed portion will not be publicly available.
The hearing on September 28th offers an opportunity to begin the process of accountability for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. That process can only begin, though, if members are given the time required to ask tough questions of the witnesses before them. We therefore ask for your assurance that members will be allowed to ask at least two rounds of questions during the open portion of the hearing on September 28th.
Thank you for your consideration.

Title: Hawley Grills Facebook on Instagram’s Harms, Negative Effects on Teens
Date: Tuesday, September 21, 2021

Content:
During today’s Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) grilled Steve Satterfield, Facebook’s Vice President of Privacy & Public Policy, about the safety of platforms like Instagram and Facebook for teenage users. Satterfield repeatedly declined to provide clarity on
internal research from Facebook
showing the negative effects their services have on users.
When Senator Hawley asked if teenagers were currently safe on any of Facebook’s platforms, Satterfield declined to give a direct answer and instead said “we’re working really hard to make that the case.” And when pressed if he would commit to keeping behavioral advertising out of products accessed by children, Satterfield again dodged, saying that “advertising is very valuable” to Facebook.
Senator Hawley responded, “I think we all know what’s really going on here. You won’t release the research because this is a cash cow for you and you won’t answer our questions because you make a gob of money on this. I mean this is the whole reason Mark Zuckerberg wanted to get Instagram in the first place, right? I mean back in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg wrote to his own chief financial officer that buying Instagram ‘will give us time to integrate their dynamics before anybody else can get close to their scale.’ Well we know why Facebook bought Instagram, it was to get rid of a competitor, to gobble up all the data, and now they’ve done that. And now, it’s making teenagers sick and destroying their mental health but, ya know, hey it’s lucrative.”

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Google About Pro-Life Censorship
Date: Wednesday, September 15, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding an explanation as to why ads placed by Live Action and Choose Life Marketing have seemingly been censored.
Choose Life Marketing is a Missouri company that works with pregnancy resource centers throughout the country by developing and circulating online ads detailing women’s health services that the centers offer. Recently, while attempting to run ads for a client in the Washington, D.C. metro area, Choose Life Marketing realized that these ads were not running, even though Google designated them as eligible. Compounding the issue, pro-life advocacy group Live Action reported yesterday that its ads had similarly been disapproved by Google—suggesting a broader pattern of targeting on Google’s part.
Senator Hawley writes, “When I spoke with Mark Zuckerberg about a similar issue in September 2019, he acknowledged the danger of bias on the parts of content reviewers in this area, particularly where pro-life activist groups like Live Action are concerned. But if your company’s behavior is any indication, those concerns have gone unaddressed. Rather, your company appears to have taken a page out of the progressive left playbook and has started targeting pregnancy resource centers and pro-life activist organizations for disfavor.  This would not be the first time that political considerations have influenced your company’s ad eligibility decisions.”
Among other questions, Senator Hawley requested that Mr. Pichai explain why Choose Life Marketing’s clients ads in the D.C. area are not appearing online and why Live Action’s advertising campaigns were abruptly disapproved by Google.

Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google, LLC
1600 Amphitheater Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
Choose Life Marketing is a Missouri company that works with pregnancy resource centers throughout the country. In particular, Choose Life Marketing helps these groups develop and circulate online ads detailing the women’s health services that they offer, such as free pregnancy tests. Consistent with Google’s stated policies, however, Choose Life Marketing does not publish “ads using keywords related to getting an abortion.”
Recently, while attempting to run ads for a client in the Washington, D.C. metro area, Choose Life Marketing realized that these ads were not running, even though Google designated them as eligible to run. Worse, Choose Life Marketing was unable to obtain an explanation from your company. Notably, even a cursory investigation reveals numerous examples of Planned Parenthood advertising directly to internet users that it offers abortions, contrary to Google’s stated policies.
All of this is alarming enough on its own, and the situation has only continued to escalate. Notably, Lila Rose—president of the pro-life organization Live Action—reported on September 14 that your company had pulled the plug on Live Action’s advertising campaigns, citing “Google Ads policy.”
When I spoke with Mark Zuckerberg about a similar issue in September 2019, he acknowledged the danger of bias on the parts of content reviewers in this area, particularly where pro-life activist groups like Live Action are concerned. But if your company’s behavior is any indication, those concerns have gone unaddressed. Rather, your company appears to have taken a page out of the progressive left playbook and has started targeting pregnancy resource centers and pro-life activist organizations for disfavor.
This would not be the first time that political considerations have influenced your company’s ad eligibility decisions. In the summer of 2020, under pressure from the cryptic partisan organization “Center for Countering Digital Hate,” Google threatened the conservative website The Federalist with removal from the Google Ads platform, based on the contents of its comments section. Something similar appears to be happening here.
Accordingly, please provide my office with answers to the following questions at your earliest convenience:
Why have Choose Life Marketing’s clients’ ads in the D.C. area not appeared online, despite being designated as eligible to run?
Why were Live Action’s advertising campaigns abruptly disapproved by Google?
At what rate are ads produced by crisis pregnancy centers, pro-life advocacy organizations, and firms that work with them, deemed ineligible for distribution on Google’s platform?
What contacts have Google executives or other leaders had with abortion advocacy organizations in the last month?
It has been widely reported that a number of aggressive internal cadres of progressive employees are active within Google, leading to harsh backlash against employees who do not share these views. What steps has Google taken to ensure that ad eligibility decisions are not affected by employee bias?
I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley Demands Explanation of Unconstitutional Biden Vaccine Mandate
Date: Friday, September 10, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh demanding an explanation of the supposed constitutional basis of the Department of Labor’s planned attempt to use the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to mandate vaccinations for 80 million private-sector workers. Senator Hawley writes that OSHA’s power is “exceedingly limited” in this regard so the Biden administration “decided to take an end run around public accountability in favor of heavy-handed authoritarianism.”
Senator Hawley writes,
“Congress, not the President, has the authority to make law. This is an elementary principle of American governance, but President Biden has flouted it with his unprecedented, arbitrary decision to mandate that certain employers—but not others—require workers to be vaccinated or undergo rigorous testing procedures. This is bad policy. It is an infringement of every citizen’s fundamental rights. But most of all, it is an unlawful bypassing of established regulatory procedures.”
Among other questions, Senator Hawley requested Secretary Walsh describe what specific legal authority OSHA is relying on, whether there is any precedent for treating a widespread disease under such an order, and whether anyone at OSHA raised concerns about the lawfulness of the proposal.

VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION
The Honorable Marty Walsh
Secretary of Labor
U.S. Department of Labor
200 Constitution Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20210
Dear Secretary Walsh:
Congress, not the President, has the authority to make law. This is an elementary principle of American governance, but President Biden has flouted it with his unprecedented, arbitrary decision to mandate that certain employers—but not others—require workers to be vaccinated or undergo rigorous testing procedures. This is bad policy. It is an infringement of every citizen’s fundamental rights. But most of all, it is an unlawful bypassing of established regulatory procedures.
According to the White House, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is “developing a rule that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work.” [
1
] OSHA will “issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to implement this requirement.” [
2
] It is projected to impact over 80 million workers in private sector businesses with 100+ employees. [
3
]
OSHA’s power to promulgate such policies by executive fiat is exceedingly limited. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA may issue an ETS without going through the normal rulemaking process only where (1) “employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards,” and (2) “such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.” Indeed, Congress was clear that it did not intend the ETS process to “be utilized to circumvent the regular standard-setting process.”
But that is precisely what has happened here. Rather than promulgating this substantive measure through ordinary notice-and-comment procedures—or seeking congressional authorization for such a policy—the Biden administration has decided to take an end run around public accountability in favor of heavy-handed authoritarianism. We know this because shortly after this rule was announced, President Biden’s Chief of Staff retweeted a comment that “OSHA doing this vaxx mandate as an emergency workplace safety rule is the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations.” [
4
] Such a view of executive authority is positively grotesque. Ours is a government of enumerated powers—not “ultimate work-arounds.”
The federal courts have not looked favorably on such arrogations of authority in the past. Indeed, when OSHA attempted a similar shortcut decades ago, a federal circuit court struck down the ETS, holding that OSHA “by-passed normal notice-and comment rulemaking procedures” in issuing an ETS altering permissible exposure levels of asbestos. Asbestos Info. Ass’n/N.A. v. Occupational Safety and Health Admin., 727 F.2d 415, 417 (5th Cir. 1984).
The Biden administration’s proposed ETS is especially problematic because it has no clear nexus to workplace safety: in the past, OSHA has exclusively used its rulemaking authority to address toxins and other specific workplace hazards—like asbestos—but it is unprecedented for OSHA to regulate large sectors of the economy in the name of public safety hazards that are not limited to the workplace. The Biden administration’s action seeks to transform the ETS process into a mechanism by which an administration can dictate any policy change it wishes in the name of “public health.”
Perhaps knowing this, President Biden consistently affirmed that he would not impose a vaccine mandate. When asked about this on December 4, 2020, he stated, “No, I don’t think it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it be mandatory.” [
5
] Similarly, this summer the Biden Administration’s Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated “There will be no nationwide mandate…. There will be no federal mandate.” [
6
]
But now, in an attempt to distract from his botched Afghanistan withdrawal, President Biden has decided that the time has come to exact as much pain as possible on the perceived “holdouts” who don’t comprise his own political base. Indeed, as President Biden said himself, “We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin.” [
7
] His inability to competently lead—to persuade his fellow Americans of a specific course of action—is no warrant for throwing aside the strictures of constitutional government in the name of dictatorial power.
I support vaccination, and I have encouraged individuals in my State to receive one, where it is consistent with their medical needs and religious faith. But vaccination should be an individual decision based on choice, not required by the federal government—or worse, required through midnight emergency regulations of the administrative state.
OSHA’s Emergency Temporary Standard is patently unlawful and bad policy. The Department of Labor should immediately suspend all efforts to produce such an Emergency Temporary Standard.
Furthermore, in order for Congress to evaluate remedial legislation, please answer the following questions by September 24, 2021:
Under what specific legal authority does OSHA plan to issue this ETS?
Is there any precedent for treating a widespread disease, such as COVID-19, as a “toxic or physically harmful” agent or “new hazard” within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 655(c)(2)?
Has OSHA ever used its authority to promulgate ETS interim rules outside the contexts of healthcare and social services?
Did anyone at OSHA raise concerns about the lawfulness of the proposed ETS?
Why were certain constituencies, such as the U.S. Postal Service, explicitly excluded from the reach of the proposed ETS?
What considerations were made to respect individuals’ religious liberties?
Is OSHA currently in the process of pursuing notice-and-comment regulations to supplant the proposed ETS?
I look forward to prompt responses from the Department.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and eight colleagues
sent a letter
to Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) calling for hearings on the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Specifically, the senators requested sworn testimony from senior military leaders including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, and Commander of U.S. Central Command General Frank McKenzie, Jr.
“The American people, and in particular many of those who serve our country in uniform, are hurting, angry, and disappointed. We owe them a clear and comprehensive understanding of what happened, why, and how best to learn from these events for the future.”
“We owe it to our nation, those who served, their families, and our allies and partners who fought alongside us, to preserve the records of how our fight in Afghanistan concluded. The insights we gather will help prevent future loss of American blood and treasure, a solemn responsibility and sacred trust we believe all members of our committee will seek to uphold,”

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on the crisis President Biden’s failure of leadership has caused in Afghanistan:
“President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a disastrous display of incompetence that has provoked a humanitarian crisis. He and his administration failed to adequately prepare, failed to safeguard Americans and those who have helped us, drastically underestimated the speed with which the Taliban would overrun Kabul and other parts of the country, and have generally shown themselves unable to fulfill their commitment to an orderly withdrawal.
“Those who advocated 20 years of nation building in Afghanistan and continually promised the American people that Afghan security forces would soon be able to defend themselves have much to answer for as well. For two decades, almost no one has leveled with the American people about the true state of affairs in Afghanistan.
“President Biden’s incompetence and failure of leadership is only the latest failure from the Washington establishment in this long war in which so many Americans have honorably fought and died. All of them should answer to the public.”

Title: Senator Hawley Leads Letter Demanding Oversight of ICE Arrests of Criminal Illegal Aliens Under Biden Administration
Date: Monday, August 16, 2021

Content:
In light of the
massive surge
of illegal border crossings reported last week, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), joined by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), sent a
letter
to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting critical information on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s record of apprehensions during the Biden Administration.
Interior enforcement by ICE is a key tool for deterring illegal immigration by holding criminal aliens accountable through apprehensions and deportations. But new policies under the Biden Administration are hamstringing officers from making arrests in the field, all while the crisis at the border worsens. In many cases, the Biden Administration now requires ICE officers to get permission to make an apprehension through a time-intensive preapproval system, which has resulted in
plummeting arrests. Congress and the public have no insight into how this new system is operating, its impact on field enforcement operations, or how decisions are made to “approve” or “deny” an apprehension request.
“This information is vital for public accountability but also for public safety. We are aware of several cases from the field in which ICE officers were directed not to apprehend previously-deported aliens that have been convicted of felonies, such as sex crimes against minors. This follows public reporting that interior arrests by ICE dropped to the lowest level on record following the implementation of new enforcement guidance,”
wrote the Senators. “In order to uphold immigration law and keep our communities safe, we need transparency into which criminal aliens are being allowed to walk free and why.”
Under federal law, when five members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs request information from an agency within the committee’s jurisdiction, the agency is required to provide that information.

In an attempt to distance themselves from their party’s radical ‘defund the police’ movement, all but one Senate Democrat supported Senator Hawley’s (R-Mo.) amendment to the budget resolution early this morning to hire 100,000 new police officers.

“As you have recognized, putting 100,000 more officers on the beat is vitally important for public safety. Defunding the police is exactly wrong; we must increase funding for new cops,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “On the Senate floor, Senator Durbin eloquently reminded us of President Biden’s support for a similar idea in the 1994 crime bill that he authored as a Senator… I am thrilled there is near-unanimous support for increased funding for police and for putting more cops on the beat.”

Title: Senator Hawley Announces 15 Amendments to Democrats’ Far-Left Budget, Calls to Pass Parent Tax Credit, Hire More Police, and Reopen Schools
Date: Monday, August 09, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will introduce 15 amendments to the Democrats’ newly-proposed $3.5 trillion budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2022. Senator Hawley’s amendments would allow for the hiring of 100,000 new police officers, restrict federal funding for K-12 schools that refuse to fully reopen, fight back against critical race theory, and protect the unborn.
Passage of the budget resolution will trigger a reconciliation process, which Senate Democrats have announced will include numerous far-left priorities.
Senator Hawley said,
“The Democratic Party is attempting to pass what could be the most radical left-wing legislation this country has ever seen—and they’re rushing it through Congress, hoping no one notices. Joe Biden and his allies in the Senate want to ram through a multi-trillion-dollar budget that lays the groundwork for their far-left agenda, like amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, the Green New Deal, and a sweeping takeover of the American family by the federal government. The Senate is not just a rubber stamp for this kind of insanity. I will make sure that my colleagues lining up to support this agenda are held accountable.”
Senator Hawley previously called for the budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2021 to
end offshoring by multinational corporations
and
ban Big Tech mergers and acquisitions.
BACKGROUND
Senator Hawley’s amendments would:
Allow for the hiring of
100,000 new police officers
to combat the growing crime wave in the United States.
Ban critical race theory in federal workplace diversity training.
Promote patriotic education in K-12 schools and teach students to
love America.
Create a
parent tax credit

Title: Senator Hawley Releases Hold on Top Biden Pentagon Nominee, Leader of the Next National Defense Strategy
Date: Monday, August 09, 2021

Content:
Last night, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released his hold on Dr. Mara Karlin’s nomination to be the next Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities. Senator Hawley held Dr. Karlin’s nomination in order to ensure her commitment to a strategy of denial and a force planning construct that focuses on China. He released his hold after receiving a
letter
from Dr. Karlin in which she expressed just that.
“The 2018 National Defense Strategy revolutionized defense planning by embracing deterrence by denial and adopting a force planning construct that prioritizes China above all else, including simultaneous conflicts with lesser rivals,”
said Senator Hawley. “It is imperative that we keep both of these concepts at the center of the next NDS. Dr. Karlin has strongly endorsed doing just that.”
As Dr. Karlin writes, and as the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command have testified, a strategy of denial is essential for deterring China. As Dr. Karlin further acknowledges, neither deterrence by cost-imposition nor horizontal escalation will be as effective for deterring Chinese aggression, especially against Taiwan.
The U.S. military will only be able to deter China, however, if it stays focused on this threat. The force planning construct will help it do just that by ensuring American forces are sized, shaped, and employed first and foremost to defeat Chinese aggression, even if that requires us to do less in other theaters, as Dr. Karlin notes in her letter.
If confirmed, Dr. Karlin is expected to lead development of President Biden’s national defense strategy.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Prioritize China Threat, Strengthen Transparency for Department of Defense Global Force Management
Date: Friday, August 06, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Global Force Management Oversight
Act. This legislation will ensure Congress has the information it needs to help the Department of Defense (DoD) balance between combatant commanders’ seemingly unlimited requests for forces and the need to stay focused on China and the Indo-Pacific.
“The Department of Defense says it’s prioritizing the China threat, but its actions say otherwise,” said
Senator Hawley. “For too long, the Department has struggled to rein in combatant commanders’ insatiable desire for additional forces, particularly in the Middle East. It’s time to bring transparency to global force management, so we can ensure our forces are modernized and ready to deter China.”
U.S. Representative Rob Wittman (R-Va.) introduced the House companion. “As we traverse the delicate balancing act of modernizing our forces to prepare for Great Power Competition while meeting existing operational demands, the need for accountability within the Global Force Management Allocation and Request For Forces process has become greater than ever. Excessive requests for forces from lower priority theatres risk upsetting this balance and disrupting our long-term efforts to deter China,” said
Representative Wittman.
“The
Global Force Management Oversight Act
shines a much-needed light into this process and will help to ensure the United States Military remains the dominant force at sea, on land, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace.”
Beijing seeks to dominate the Indo-Pacific, and it is rapidly modernizing the People’s Liberation Army so it can do just that. Were it to succeed, it would mean the loss of American access to many of the world’s most important markets, with severe implications for the lives and livelihoods of working Americans.
The
Global Force Management Oversight Act
requires DoD to report to Congress annually on:
The contents of the Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP), which lays out how DoD will allocate forces to meet operational requirements in a given year, while still building readiness and modernizing the force for future challenges.
Any deviations between DoD’s actual force allocations in a given year and the allocations stipulated in the GFMAP for that year.
A list of requests for forces submitted by combatant commanders in a given year, with an explanation for why each request was approved, denied, or deferred.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on USDA to Hold Meatpackers Accountable for Anti-Competitive Behavior
Date: Wednesday, August 04, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
urged
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to leverage the full scope of his statutory authority to hold meatpackers accountable for anticompetitive behavior, including threatening to revoke inspection services for these companies, which would have a major impact on their bottom-line.
“After years of consolidation in the beef, pork, and chicken processing industries, the food supply chain in the United States has become dangerously fragile,”
Senator Hawley writes.
“The biggest firms will not curb their anticompetitive practices unless they face a penalty that impacts their bottom line. Big companies require big penalties. Federal statute provides you with robust authority to revoke inspection services following convictions for fraudulent behavior in the marketplace.”
Full text of the letter is available
here
and below.
The Honorable Tom Vilsack
Secretary
U.S. Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Avenue SW
Washington, DC 20250
Dear Secretary Vilsack,
I write to urge you to immediately conduct an exhaustive investigation into the largest food processing and meatpacking businesses and revoke inspection services in order to hold these companies accountable for fraudulent and anticompetitive behavior. As Secretary, it is critical that you leverage the full extent of your authority provided by Congress to restore competition, safeguard farmers and ranchers, and ensure food security for all Americans.
After years of consolidation in the beef, pork, and chicken processing industries, the food supply chain in the United States has become dangerously fragile. For example, in the last several decades, the number of slaughterhouses processing one million hogs per year has more than doubled, while the average number of cattle slaughtered per plant doubled between 1976 and 2006.
[1]
When their shares are aggregated, three multinational meatpacking companies—Tyson Foods, JBS of Brazil, and WH Group of China—control 63 percent of pork packing, 46 percent of beef packing, and 38 percent of poultry processing in the United States.[2] During the COVID-19 pandemic, shutdowns of a handful of processing plants, such as those operated by WH Group-owned Smithfield Foods, led to shortages across the country.
[3]
As a consequence, small producers and ranchers face dramatic price swings that can threaten the viability of their business. The fact that several of the biggest processors are foreign-owned suggests that American farmers and consumers are not adequately protected in times of crisis.
Market concentration is also driving a rise in criminal anticompetitive activity by the largest firms. Earlier this year, Pilgrim’s Pride, a subsidiary of JBS and one of the largest chicken processors in the United States, pled guilty to a criminal conspiracy to fix prices.[4] Under federal law, you have the clear authority to “refuse to provide, or withdraw, inspection service” when the applicant for inspection services or anyone reasonably connected to the applicant has been convicted of a felony or “any other act or circumstances indicating a lack of the integrity needed for the conduct of operations affecting the public health.”[5] Similar authorities also exist for refusing or withdrawing inspection services for meat,[6] eggs,[7] and even grain.[8] I urge you to use this authority where appropriate with respect to Pilgrim’s Pride and all large food processors operating in the United States under your jurisdiction that have been convicted of crimes that trigger these statutes.
The biggest firms will not curb their anticompetitive practices unless they face a penalty that impacts their bottom line. Big companies require big penalties. Federal statute provides you with robust authority to revoke inspection services following convictions for fraudulent behavior in the marketplace. Therefore, as a complement to any current, ongoing investigations with the Department of Justice concerning violations of the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act,[9] you must also aggressively use this inspection authority to ensure that the biggest firms are both held accountable for anticompetitive practices and make commitments that will reduce fraudulent behavior, industry concentration, and foreign control of those businesses critical to the food security of the United States.
Thank you for your attention to this matter important to producers and consumers in Missouri and across America.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Op-Ed: Public schools must shape kids who love America and our founding
Date: Monday, August 02, 2021

Content:
By Sen. Josh Hawley | Published on August 1, 2021 |
New York Post
Parents know something is wrong. It’s why they are showing up in droves at school-board meetings across the nation. They are sending a message. They don’t want their children taught that the true founding of America came in 1619, or that America is a systemically racist place, or that most Americans are ­oppressors. They don’t want their children taught lies. And they are right.
Sometimes, these lies go by the name “critical race theory,” a pet project of the left that ­began, as many bad ideas do, in the academy and has spread in recent years across corporate America and into school curricula. Sometimes the lies are called “anti-racism.”
Whatever the label, the central principles are the same. These doctrines teach that American society is structurally oppressive, that our culture is shot through with racism and other forms of bigotry, and that most Americans are complicit in racial oppression, knowingly or not.
[. . .]
Let’s be clear. This isn’t a ­nation of oppressors. This is a nation of liberators. This is the country founded on the worth and dignity of every individual. This is the country that gave working people the right to vote. This is the country that freed the slaves. This is the ­nation that has brought more good to the planet than any other people in history.
And it is time we defend that being taught in school. Critical race theory in any guise is a toxin. It poisons the bloodstream of our national life and drives Americans further apart. Sometimes, it seems that this is just what its advocates want: ­division, anger, hatred. But that isn’t what America needs. America needs the truth, ­because it’s the truth about our history and our purpose that unites us as a nation.
That’s why I’m proposing a bill to require every school district in America that receives taxpayer money to teach our kids the founding documents and principles of this country.
[. . .]
Why anyone would object to this most basic of civics education is hard to fathom. That so many on the left do reveals how confused they have become. In recent days, leftist commentators have accused me of “whitewashing” American history and advocating “indoctrination” akin to the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
Just to state the accusations is to expose their absurdity. Teaching our kids the actual documents that express the true principles that make us Americans isn’t whitewashing. It is ­education. It used to be seen as one of the central purposes of public schools. And teaching children to love America isn’t indoctrination. It’s what binds us together as citizens.
The left increasingly vilifies America’s history and purpose. Leftists advocate for tearing it all down — both literally, with violent riots masquerading as “social justice,” and figuratively, by casting the institutions of our culture as oppressive, from the family to religious faith. Americans increasingly see this assault on our common life ­together for what it is — an attempt to utterly remake America — and reject it. We can’t ­allow this agenda of destruction and rage to succeed.
The true principles on which this country was founded have inspired generations. And they summon us still toward great deeds. Every school boy and girl has the right to claim them as his or her heritage. And all school children should learn them as their own.
This is my conviction: Our children can perform wonders we haven’t yet imagined. They can write a future for this country beyond anything we have dared to dream. But first they must know who they are, and who we are together, as a ­nation. This is an investment in the future that will yield a ­remarkable return. It’s an ­investment of love. Let’s make it together —and now. Let’s teach our children to know and love America.

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces Bill to Promote Patriotism, Love for Country, and Push Back on Critical Race Theory in Schools
Date: Monday, July 26, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will introduce the
Love America Act, new legislation to promote patriotism in education and fight back against the spread of anti-American, critical race theory classes in K-12 education. Senator Hawley’s bill would require all schools and school districts that receive federal funding to ensure students are able to read and recite America’s founding documents and bar federal funding from schools that teach those documents are the products of white supremacy or racism.
Senator Hawley said,
“Over the past year, Americans have watched stunned as a radical ideology spread through our country’s elite institutions—one that teaches America is an irredeemably racist nation founded by white supremacists. Now it has found its way into our children’s schools. We cannot afford for our children to lose faith in the noble ideals this country was founded on. We have to make sure that our children understand what makes this country great, the ideals of hope and promise our Founding Fathers fought for, and the love of country that unites us all.”
The
Love America Act
:
Requires students to read the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Pledge of Allegiance and recite portions of these foundational texts at certain grade levels:
In 1st grade, students read and are able to recite the Pledge of Allegiance
In 4th grade, students read the U.S. Constitution and are able to recite its preamble
In 8th grade, students read the Declaration of Independence and are able to recite its preamble
In 10th grade, students read and are able to identify the Bill of Rights
Would make schools ineligible for federal funding if they teach that the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, or Pledge of Allegiance are the product of white supremacy or racism.

Title: Hawley Leads Amicus Brief with Lee & Cruz, Urging Supreme Court to Overrule Roe, Casey
Date: Monday, July 26, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), filed an amicus brief in the case of
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, urging the Court to overrule its decisions in
Roe v. Wade
and
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.
The brief argues that the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence finds no basis in the Constitution, and points out that the “undue burden” standard in particular has resulted in contradictory outcomes, disarray in the lower courts, and judicial lawmaking. The Senators urged the Court to overrule
Casey
and
Roe
and return the question of abortion legislation to the states and the people.
The Senators write,
“This status quo is untenable. Where a legal doctrine has repeatedly failed to offer clarity—where it has proved unworkable in the past and will likely engender unpredictable consequences in the future—its existence constitutes an open invitation to judges to interpret it according to their own policy preferences, usurping the constitutional prerogatives of the legislature.
Roe
and
Casey
should be overruled, and the question of abortion legislation should be returned to the states.”

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) commemorated the third anniversary of the 2018 duck boat tragedy at Table Rock Lake—one of the deadliest boating accidents in U.S. history.
In December 2020, Senator Hawley’s bipartisan
Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act
passed the Senate unanimously. In January 2021, Senator Hawley
reintroduced the bill, along with cosponsors Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
Senator Hawley said,
“Today we remember those who tragically lost their lives three years ago at Table Rock Lake. As we reflect on this entirely preventable accident, we must honor those lost by supporting common-sense legislation to ensure this never happens again. For decades Congress has failed to update safety standards for duck boats and I remain committed to seeing updated standards become law.”

Title: Senators Hawley, Graham Demand Judiciary Hearing on Border Crisis
Date: Thursday, July 15, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)
sent a letter
to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) calling for a full hearing on the current crisis of the southern border. Senate Judiciary Democrats have declined to hold a hearing on the border this Congress, despite the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended historic numbers of migrants not seen in over 15 years.
“There is a severe humanitarian and public health crisis at the southern border due to the recent surge in migrants, including unaccompanied children. It is imperative we do not let this surge continue due to our complacency,”
the Senators write.
“Hearing from those tasked with managing this crisis will aid the Committee in doing its part to protect the vulnerable, and restore order to the border. Lives are depending on it.”
This week Senator Hawley joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in
introducing legislation
to codify the Trump administration’s public health order under Title 42 that required U.S. border officials to promptly remove illegal immigrants to stop the spread of COVID-19.
Full text of the letter is available
here
and below.
July 15, 2021
The Honorable Dick Durbin
Chair
United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary
Dear Chair Durbin,
We write today to request that you hold a full Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the current state of the border as soon as possible. There is a severe humanitarian and public health crisis at the southern border due to the recent surge in migrants, including unaccompanied children. It is imperative we do not let this surge continue due to our complacency. We must elicit testimony from key witnesses, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Hearing from those tasked with managing this crisis will aid the Committee in doing its part to protect the vulnerable, and restore order to the border. Lives are depending on it.
During the 116th Congress, the full Committee held four hearings with key Department of Homeland Security witnesses, including two hearings on the border crisis with then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan. At least two of the full Committee hearings, a CBP oversight hearing and a COVID-19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement best practices detention hearing, were held at the request of then-Ranking Member Feinstein. We ask that you kindly return the favor and allow a hearing on the border in Committee as migrant and smuggling encounters continue to rise.
As I’m sure you are aware, this past March, April, and May, CBP apprehended historic numbers of migrants not seen in over 15 years. So far this fiscal year, CBP has encountered 929,868 migrants at the border. [1] That is almost as many migrants encountered in all of 2019, and almost double the total numbers seen in all of 2018 and 2020. These increased numbers are testing the limits of CBP’s processing capacity. CBP is overwhelmed with feeding, clothing, testing, and caring for migrants, and as a result, have had to turn attention from the important tasks of interdicting fentanyl, cocaine, and heroin and facilitating lawful travel and trade. CBP has managed to do its best to perform these important tasks while dealing with the additional health concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Smugglers and cartels are making billions of dollars off our broken border by preying on vulnerable migrants. Yet, the Biden administration has not proposed any meaningful solution to shut off the flow and regain control. In fact, President Biden has made conditions at the border much worse. In his first months in office, President Biden rescinded successful policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, reinstated “catch and release,” eliminated safe third country agreements with Northern Triangle nations, and stopped applying Title 42 public health authority used slow the spread of COVID-19 to unaccompanied children and anyone else deemed “exempt” by this Administration. As a result, the number of migrants crossing our borders has increased at an alarming pace.[2]
These migrants, especially the often tender-aged unaccompanied children, are reportedly subjected to abusive conditions by smugglers and criminals on the journey to the United States. In the past few months, CBP officials have reported several heart-breaking incidents involving young children. Along the New Mexican border, a smuggler was caught on camera dropping a 3-yr-old and a 5-yr-old from a 14-foot border fence into the United States. Along the Texas border, a six-month old was thrown in the Rio Grande River after her mother was assaulted by the smugglers she paid to transport them. In both situations, it is clear the smugglers have no regard for the human life they are transporting. These migrants are commodities. And if they were not found and rescued by the courageous women and men of the Border Patrol, they would have likely starved or dehydrated to death, or succumbed to the harsh desert elements. Unfortunately, these stories are not unique. We know migrants arrive severely dehydrated, terribly ill, and as victims of sexual assault, including brutal gang-rape, on a regular basis.
The most egregious part about the border crisis is that it could be solved if only we take appropriate action. The Committee shouldn’t stand by and watch this catastrophe unfold yet again. We must hear from the Department of Homeland Security about the problem so we can find a workable solution. If we don’t, we’re afraid we will have no one to blame but ourselves.
We look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Lindsey O. Graham

The assessment found that migrants “often make decisions based on rumors and word-of-mouth from family, lawyers, or other migrants and react quickly to changes—real or perceived—using their informal social networks.”

Title: Hawley Hammers Facebook, Twitter on Collusion with Biden Administration to Censor Speech
Date: Thursday, July 15, 2021

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent letters to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding answers on their collusion with the Biden administration to suppress free speech. Senator Hawley said the revelations raise questions as to whether the platforms are operating as arms of the federal government.
Senator Hawley writes,
“This casual admission of collusion—between the state and corporations that have monopolized the flow of information and therefore dictate the terms of service for the public square—is shocking. The First Amendment is sacrosanct, and it is unconscionable that the federal government has evidently enlisted private actors to police speech in ways that they are unable.”

Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,
I write with grave concern about the latest evidence that your company is coordinating with the federal government to suppress free speech in the United States of America.
Earlier today, the White House Press Secretary told reporters that the Biden Administration is in “regular touch with the social media platforms” about misinformation and disinformation related to COVID-19, and that it is “flagging problematic posts for Facebook.” This casual admission of collusion—between the state and corporations that have monopolized the flow of information and therefore dictate the terms of service for the public square—is shocking. The First Amendment is sacrosanct, and it is unconscionable that the federal government has evidently enlisted private actors to police speech in ways that it is unable.
This alarming revelation of a public-private partnership to censor the speech of the American people comes just hours after the Surgeon General of the United States, the federal government’s leading spokesperson on matters of public health, published an advisory warning to the American public about the “urgent threat” of health misinformation and disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The advisory instructs technology platforms on how they can limit the spread of disinformation on its platforms, including hiring more employees to “strengthen the monitoring of misinformation” and to “impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies.”
These new admissions and directives by federal officials raise further questions as to whether social media platforms like Facebook have functionally become arms of the federal government. Please respond to the following request for information by July 22, 2021:
Please provide a full accounting of social media posts and content that the Biden Administration has flagged to employees of Facebook.

Title: Senators Hawley, Lee Demand EEOC Rescind Guidance Based on “Extreme and Partisan” Interpretation of Bostock Decision
Date: Wednesday, July 14, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah)
demanded
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Chair Charlotte Burrows immediately rescind an extreme, partisan guidance
document
on employment discrimination. The Senators write the EEOC’s “Protections Against Employment Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity” document promotes a radical interpretation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s
Bostock
decision and was issued unilaterally by the Biden-appointed chair, in violation of established procedures.
“The guidance issued is legally wrong, procedurally invalid, and inconsistent with the rule of law. It should be rescinded immediately, or at a minimum, put to a vote of the Commission as a whole,”
the Senators write.
“It is part of a pattern of disregard for the religious liberty of millions of Americans. We worry that it is only the beginning of more to come in the Biden Administration’s march toward social justice, critical race theory, and the far-Left agenda.”
After
Bostock v. Clayton County
was decided, Senator Hawley
took to the Senate floor
to warn the decision would result in far-reaching consequences from employment law to sports to churches.

131 M St NE
Washington, DC 20002
Dear Ms. Burrows:
We write with serious concern about the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (“EEOC”) purported guidance document entitled “Protections Against Employment Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity.”[1] This document takes an extreme and partisan interpretation of Supreme Court precedent and was issued in violation of established procedures, as detailed in 29 C.F.R. § 1695.2(d). It should be rescinded immediately.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”[2] In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court interpreted Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of “sex” as including sexual orientation and gender identity.[3] The Supreme Court clearly asserted that “The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.”[4] The Court did not purport to address matters pertaining to sex-segregated spaces, pronoun usage, dress codes, or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment such as training, promotions, or pay.
At the time, we criticized this decision on the Senate floor. Senator Hawley warned that the decision would result in “far-reaching” consequences “from employment law to sports to churches.”[5] He predicted this based on what “every honest person knows,” namely, “that the laws in this country today are made almost entirely by unelected bureaucrats and courts.”[6] Senator Lee criticized the decision for taking “a meat cleaver to the issue” without considering exceptions for religious entities or protections for women’s sports, restrooms, and shelters.[7]  We believe that Bostock was wrongly decided, but your guidance goes far beyond what even the Supreme Court sanctioned.
The EEOC’s new guidance document advances a radical interpretation of Bostock to support a far-Left agenda. Its interpretation is insupportable: as a senior EEOC official recently stated, “No one who has actually read the Bostock opinion could make such sweeping claims in good faith.”[8]
Here are a few examples of the guidance’s disregard for the actual precedent of the Court:
The EEOC’s guidance states that “employers may not deny an employee equal access to a bathroom, locker room, or shower that corresponds to the employee’s gender identity.” But the Supreme Court explicitly did not address this issue in its decision, stating that “we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”[9]
The document also claims that the use of pronouns inconsistent with an employee’s gender identity can be unlawful harassment. This interpretation cannot be found in the Bostock majority opinion; the only mention of pronouns is in Justice Alito’s dissent, which warned that government pronoun policies would abridge the freedom of speech.[10]
Further, the document asserts that “Prohibiting a transgender person from dressing or presenting consistent with that person’s gender identity would constitute sex discrimination.” But while the Bostockopinion mentioned that some observers feared “dress codes will prove unsustainable after our decision,” the Court explicitly stated that “we do not prejudge any such question today.”[11]
The guidance document discusses not just hiring and firing practices but also “promotions, demotions, discipline, training, work assignments, pay, overtime, or other compensation, fringe benefits, [and] other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.” This broad language explicitly contradicts the majority opinion in Bostock, which stated that although “[f]iring employees . . . surely counts” as unlawful discrimination, whether “other policies or practices might or might not qualify as unlawful discrimination . . . are questions for future cases, not these.”[12]
In case after case, the guidance document purports to “apply” Bostock to issues that the opinion went to great lengths to distinguish.[13] But the guidance extends Bostock to numerous issues that the opinion expressly disavowed.
In addition to misrepresenting the Court’s decision in Bostock, the guidance document was also issued in violation of agency procedure. According to reports, you unilaterally issued this document without allowing a vote of the EEOC’s five-member panel, despite the EEOC’s internal requirement that a vote be taken before the agency advances novel legal interpretations.[14] In the words of a high-ranking EEOC official, this constitutes “a flagrant disregard for the EEOC’s own procedures and for the rule of law.”[15]
This is especially concerning because a majority of the Commissioners were appointed by a different political party than your own. This irregularity therefore gives rise to the inference that the Democrat-appointed Chair of the EEOC skirted regular protocol in order to enact her preferred policy preferences, knowing full well that a majority of the Commissioners would never vote for this outcome if the required process had been followed. These reports thus raise serious questions about the Biden Administration’s commitment to the rule of law.
It is also flagrantly unfair to issue such substantively and procedurally flawed guidance to private parties, who are now threatened with fines and sanctions if they disagree with your partisan interpretation of Bostock. Employers across the country will now feel compelled, under threat of prosecution, to comply with this incorrect and extreme interpretation of Supreme Court precedent. This guidance is yet another example of how Democrat-appointed bureaucrats wish to leverage the machinery of the administrative state to bully private employers to kowtow to the social justice agenda.
The document bears out every fear that dissenting Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh expressed in Bostock. It is part of a pattern of disregard for the religious liberty of millions of Americans. We worry that it is only the beginning of more to come in the Biden Administration’s march toward social justice, critical race theory, and the far-Left agenda.
The guidance issued is legally wrong, procedurally invalid, and inconsistent with the rule of law. It should be rescinded immediately, or at a minimum, put to a vote of the Commission as a whole.
Please provide the following records and answer the following questions by July 16, 2021:

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Introduce SHIELD Act to Preserve Title 42 Expulsions of Illegal Immigrants
Date: Tuesday, July 13, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in introducing the
Securing the Homeland from International Entrants with Life-threatening Diseases (SHIELD) Act
to codify the Trump administration’s public health order under Title 42 that required U.S. border officials to promptly remove illegal immigrants to stop the spread of COVID-19.
Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) also cosponsored the new legislation, which prevents the Biden Administration from ending another successful Trump Administration immigration policy and worsening the border crisis.
“The Biden Administration’s dangerous open border policies have created a moral crisis on our Southern Border. President Biden has an obligation to address the issue he’s created, but instead he wants to end Title 42 and eliminate one of the few remaining tools we have from the Trump Administration to secure our border,” said
Senator Hawley. “As our country recovers from the pandemic, we should absolutely retain the ability to turn away those crossing our border illegally who pose a threat to the health of American citizens.”
“Title 42 has been an integral and extremely successful measure to protect America’s borders and our people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If the Biden-Harris policy for open borders is intended to reverse the Trump Administration’s success in securing our border, encourage illegal immigration, and create an unprecedented crisis, it’s certainly working,” said
Senator Cruz
“As we come out of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we need to continue securing our borders, not throwing open flood gates to people who could carry the deadly virus or its dangerous new variants.”
Companion legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. For Senate bill text,

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Call for Another Hearing on SBA Nominee After Ties to Anti-Israel Group Revealed
Date: Wednesday, June 30, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and seven colleagues
sent a letter
to Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) calling for an additional hearing on Dilawar Syed, President Biden’s nominee for SBA deputy administrator. The senators’ concerns come from recent inflammatory statements from Emgage Action, a vocally anti-Israel political action committee of which Syed is a member of the board.
“While his membership was disclosed to the committee prior to his nomination hearing on April 21, the political organization has since made alarming statements that have members of your committee and the small business community that we represent seriously concerned,”
the senators write.
“Emgage’s history of supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement combined with its overtly anti-Israel positions and rhetoric necessitates an additional hearing to ensure Mr. Syed’s confirmation to be the second-most-powerful individual at the SBA would not jeopardize small businesses with close ties to Israeli companies or small businesses owned by Jewish Americans.”
Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Inhofe (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) cosigned the letter.

June 30, 2021
The Honorable Ben Cardin
Chairman
Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship
428A Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Chairman Cardin:
We write today to express serious concern regarding Mr. Dilawar Syed, President Biden’s nominee to be Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), given his involvement with Emgage Action. As you know, Mr. Syed has been an active board member of Emgage Action since 2017, a political action committee affiliated with Emgage USA and vocally anti-Israel. While his membership was disclosed to the committee prior to his nomination hearing on April 21, the political organization has since made alarming statements that have members of your committee and the small business community that we represent seriously concerned.
Following Mr. Syed’s confirmation hearing, Emgage Action released incendiary statements during the regional unrest, stating “This state of affairs is not a case of ‘both sides.’ Not when Palestinians are occupied and the State of Israel is the occupier.” The organization amplified accusations that Israel is an apartheid state and issued a statement of support after a House member inexcusably equated Israel and the United States to Hamas and Taliban terrorist organizations, something that earned the rebuke of the Democratic Speaker of the House. These comments are not only inflammatory, they demonstrate a deep-seated prejudice that is of serious concern to the small business community.
Emgage’s history of supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement combined with its overtly anti-Israel positions and rhetoric necessitates an additional hearing to ensure Mr. Syed’s confirmation to be the second-most-powerful individual at the SBA would not jeopardize small businesses with close ties to Israeli companies or small businesses owned by Jewish Americans. If an individual who supports these accusations was to be confirmed, it would hinder the close cooperation businesses in America and Israel have in areas such as, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, medicine, bio-medicine, and more.
Respectfully,

Title: Hawley Discusses Violent Crime Wave, Opposition to ATF Nominee Chipman at Senate Judiciary Hearing
Date: Thursday, June 24, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) discussed key facts about the violent crime wave spreading across Missouri and the rest of the country during today’s
Senate Judiciary hearing, describing how police departments big and small have expressed that they feel overwhelmed and outnumbered. Sen. Hawley introduced a
new pro-police agenda
this week, which would put an additional 100,000 officers back on the streets.
“It is a simple reality and the American people are feeling it. The people in my state are feeling it. They are afraid to go out at night. They’re afraid to go out on the streets. They’re afraid to drop their children off at school,”
said Senator Hawley. “I mean, this is not the United States of America that we should have. This is a pressing issue that is affecting every single American, and yes, every cop in America.
Sen. Hawley also reiterated why President Biden’s nominee to head up the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms (ATF) and Explosives, David Chipman, is unfit for the role.
“And when I look at Mr. Chipman’s agenda, which is to take away Second Amendment rights from law-abiding citizens while violent criminals are loose on our streets, I just, I just have to say, Mr. Chairman, I just respectfully disagree that that’s the right agenda for us to have at this time. So I will not be supporting Mr. Chipman.”

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Fauci, Collins on Purged NIH Covid Data
Date: Thursday, June 24, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Francis Collins and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci demanding answers over recent reporting that Covid gene sequences were purged from an NIH database at the d of Chinese researchers.
Senator Hawley said, “In order to properly investigate the origins of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic—and to prevent future pandemics from occurring—investigators need access to information. These efforts are already hampered by the paucity of data from the early cases of the virus in Wuhan. Yet I’m growing concerned that the NIH is not taking the CCP’s obstruction and its motives seriously, especially following evidence that NIH dollars may have found their way to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”
Senator Hawley requested Drs. Collins and Fauci provide a full account of the purged COVID-19 sequences, whether this impeded the ability of the U.S. to determine the origins of COVID-19, and if any other scientific data has been removed at the request of the CCP.

Director

Bethesda, MD 20892
Dear Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci:
I write with grave concern about the latest allegations of a COVID-19 cover-up. New public reporting suggests that Chinese researchers directed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purge gene sequences of COVID-19 cases from a key NIH database. [1] The deleted information could be critical for understanding how the virus spread and where it came from. These deletions are alarming and merit a full congressional and law enforcement investigation.
The NIH has since stated that “submitting investigators hold the rights to their data.” But that’s not what the NIH says in its public materials. It says removal of information is disfavored and is only permitted pursuant to specific protocols that do not appear to have been followed here. But moreover, why the NIH would agree to remove key data about COVID-19 in the midst of the most severe public health crisis in a century is unfathomable. It appears the removal of this data from this database was not done for scientific purposes. Rather, it could have been done to obscure the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) role in the origins of COVID-19, especially given the researchers’ apparent affiliation with Wuhan University—an institution controlled by the CCP. [2] American taxpayer-funded public health databases should be transparent and objective; they should not be subject to foreign influence.
In order to properly investigate the origins of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic—and to prevent future pandemics from occurring—investigators need access to information. These efforts are already hampered by the paucity of data from the early cases of the virus in Wuhan. Yet I’m growing concerned that the NIH is not taking the CCP’s obstruction and its motives seriously, especially following evidence that NIH dollars may have found their way to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
These newly reported actions raise serious questions about what other data Chinese-based researchers have sought to purge from the American scientific community. The American people need to know the extent of the CCP’s influence at the NIH and the CCP’s role in obscuring the origins of a pandemic that has claimed over 600,000 American lives. Please answer the following questions by July 1, 2021:
Please provide a full accounting of COVID-19 sequences that the NIH has purged from its Sequence Read Archive since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Include the name of the researchers, the nationality of the researchers, the reason requested for purging the sequences, the NIH’s rationale for purging the sequences, the date the request for the deletion was made, and the date at which the sequences were purged.
According to a Q&A for the Sequence Read Archive, the NIH states that its preference is to update rather than delete data submitted to the database. [3] Further, the NIH indicates that it follows the policy of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) with respect to withdrawal and suppression requests. [4] Pursuant to the INSDC guidelines, under what “status” were the Chinese researchers’ COVID-19 sequences submitted?
Were any conditions requested by the Chinese researchers on the availability of their submitted material upon the submission of the COVID-19 sequences to the Sequence Read Archive? And were any conditions granted?
Please describe the full process for evaluating requests for deletions of submitted material to the Sequence Read Archive. Who approves these requests for deletion?
Does the NIH have safeguards in place to protect data from deletion that is critical to the nation’s response to a public health emergency?
How did the purging of COVID-19 sequences at the behest of Chinese researchers impede the United States’ ability to develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and otherwise respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?
How has the purging of COVID-19 sequences at the behest of Chinese researchers impeded the United States’ ability to determine the origins of COVID-19?
Did the request for purging the COVID-19 sequences from the Sequence Read Archive raise any red flags that Chinese researchers might be attempting to conceal the origins of COVID-19 at the behest of the Chinese government? Please provide documents of all internal communication at the NIH, including e-mails, that concern the deletion of these COVID-19 genetic sequences.
Did any staff member at NIH raise concerns about a Chinese researcher requesting the deletion of COVID-origins data during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic?
What other scientific data, even outside of COVID-19 related information, have Chinese researchers affiliated with the CCP requested be removed from any NIH database?
I am sending a copy of this letter to the intelligence and law enforcement communities so they can take action as is appropriate. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislative Agenda to Hire 100,000 New Police Officers, Keep American Families Safe
Date: Wednesday, June 23, 2021

Content:
Ahead of President Biden’s Wednesday address on the spiking crime throughout America, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) rolled out his own legislative agenda to hire 100,000 new police officers, boost police morale, and keep American families safe.
As violent crime continues to plague the country, communities and law enforcement officers are under siege. Homicides are
dramatically increasing
across American cities, and violent crime is
hitting
generational highs. Meanwhile, police departments are facing million-dollar
budget cuts, violence against police officers is
increasing nationwide, and
low morale
among officers is causing departments to struggle with recruiting new applicants.
“American families aren’t safe, but they deserve to be. And they can be if we will act. This is not the time to defund the police or vilify them, but to support the brave men and women in blue – and put more of them on the streets. Immediately.”
Senator Josh Hawley
In response to America’s crime wave and unprecedented assault on America’s law enforcement officers, Senator Hawley is introducing the following legislative agenda:
100,000 New Law Enforcement Officers
: a bill to provide grants to local communities to support hiring an additional 100,000 additional law enforcement officers to protect American families.
Protecting Law Enforcement in the Line of Duty
: a bill to increase maximum penalties for assaulting federal officers by 50%.
Protecting Federal Judges, Prosecutors, and Law Enforcement Officers from Violence and Doxing
: a bill that directs DOJ, together with DHS, to develop programs to protect the privacy and personal information of judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.
Protecting Federal Law Enforcement Officers from Doxing
: a bill to double the penalty for doxing federal law enforcement officials and other federal officials.
Protecting Federal Courthouses and Judges
: a bill to increase penalties for damage to federal courthouses and unauthorized access to areas where federal judges work, reside, or visit.
Promoting Concealed Carry Rights for Law Enforcement Officers
: a bill to amend the
Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act
(LEOSA) to extend concealed carry rights to federal judges and prosecutors.
Further Expanding Support for Police Officers
: a bill to expand Senator Hawley’s previously passed “
Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019,” by increasing funding for family services, stress reduction, suicide prevention, and other programs for federal officers.
Protecting Law Enforcement from Targeting
: a bill to create a separate criminal offense for targeting someone based on their status as a law enforcement officer.
Protecting Law Enforcement from Ambush
: a bill to increase criminal penalties for ambushing enforcement officers.

Title: Hawley, Tillis, Cotton, Cruz Pen Letter to ATF in Defense of Americans’ Second Amendment Rights
Date: Monday, June 21, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms (ATF) and Explosives expressing concern over two of their newly-proposed gun rules that could threaten Americans’ Second Amendment rights.
The rules, 2021R-05 and 2021R-08, would require the retention of firearms transaction records forever, paving the way to a national gun registry, and clamp down on pistol braces and other devices possessed by thousands of law-abiding gun owners.
The lawmakers wrote, “These measures are concerning enough on their face. But more alarming is ATF’s apparent willingness to unilaterally make important firearms policy determinations wholly apart from Congress. Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms are safeguarded by the Second Amendment, and the responsibility for implementing those constitutional protections rests with elected lawmakers—not unelected federal bureaucrats.”

Marvin G. Richardson
Acting Director
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
U.S. Department of Justice
99 New York Avenue, NE
Washington, DC 20226
Dear Acting Director Richardson:
Over the last month, ATF has proposed two rules with far-reaching implications for Americans’ Second Amendment rights. On May 21, ATF announced Proposed Rule 2021R–05, Definition of “Frame or Receiver” and Identification of Firearms. This rule covers a breadth of issues, including the classification of split or modular frames and receivers, the identification of mufflers and silencers, and so forth, many of which will have implications for law-abiding firearms manufacturers who have worked faithfully to comply with existing laws. But most importantly, this Proposed Rule would take a significant step toward a national gun registry by requiring FFL dealers to maintain personal gun owner information and records of transactions involving firearms, including their makes, models, and serial numbers—forever.
And that wasn’t all. On June 10, ATF issued Proposed Rule 2021R–08, Factoring Criteria for Firearms With Attached “Stabilizing Braces.” This proposed rule would reverse years of interpretive guidance and recategorize millions of pistols and AR-15-style firearms as “short-barreled rifles,” placing them under the strict regulatory scheme of the National Firearms Act and making it a federal felony to otherwise possess them. Indeed, the Proposed Rule states that it “may affect upwards of 1.4 million individuals.”
These measures are concerning enough on their face. But more alarming is ATF’s apparent willingness to unilaterally make important firearms policy determinations wholly apart from Congress. Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms are safeguarded by the Second Amendment, and the responsibility for implementing those constitutional protections rests with elected lawmakers—not unelected federal bureaucrats.
Accordingly, please provide my office with responses to the following questions no later than June 25, 2021:
In the past, firearms product manufacturers have been repeatedly informed that many of the products they sell, including “receiver blanks” that have not yet been fully machined, are not considered “firearms” by ATF. Accordingly, significant reliance interests have vested. Will ATF continue to honor those prior determinations, including those pertaining to products currently on the market?
What steps does ATF intend to take to ensure that any new information that would be retained by FFL dealers pursuant to Proposed Rule 2021R–05 is not subsequently used for the targeting of lawful gun owners by federal authorities or other politically-motivated purposes?
What, if any, new measures does ATF anticipate taking to enforce the terms of Proposed Rule 2021R–08 against private gun owners?
Proposed Rule 2021R–08 states that it “will not have substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.” This claim stands in tension with the fact that numerous states and other jurisdictions have passed Second Amendment sanctuary laws in response to perceived federal overreach. Why were these many laws not considered relevant to a federalism analysis in the course of developing Proposed Rule 2021R–08?
What measures, if any, does ATF intend to take to attempt to enforce the terms of Proposed Rule 2021R–08 in jurisdictions subject to Second Amendment sanctuary laws?
Thank you for your attention to these important matters. I look forward to receiving your prompt responses to these questions.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Demands Biden SBA Nominee Renounce Anti-Semitic Rhetoric
Date: Thursday, June 17, 2021

Content:
Following new revelations today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called for Biden nominee Dilawar Syed to explain his work for an organization that has engaged in anti-Semitic rhetoric. Syed is the Biden Administration nominee for deputy director of the Small Business Administration (SBA). Syed previously sat on the board of an organization, Emgage Action, that has echoed the anti-Semitic remarks of Representative Ilhan Omar and others, including calling Israel an “apartheid state” and accusing Israel of “war crimes.”
“Dilawar Syed was a director for an organization that has engaged in anti-Semitic rhetoric, including amplifying false statements that Israel is an ‘apartheid state.’ This rhetoric is disgusting and inexcusable. Mr. Syed must renounce this hateful rhetoric and explain his association with this organization. The Small Business Committee must convene a hearing to ask Mr. Syed about these actions and determine whether he is fit to serve.”

Title: Sen. Hawley, Colleagues Blast SBA for Poor Performance in Administering Shuttered Venues Program
Date: Thursday, June 17, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Todd Young (R-Ind.)
sent a letter
to the Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Isabella Guzman blasting the SBA for its poor performance in administering the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program. The SVOG program, which was authorized by Congress in December, is a relief program intended for movie theatres, museums, and other entertainment venues that have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Congress has provided the program with more than $16 billion in appropriations, but after almost six months, only a small fraction of venue operators have actually received their grants from the SBA.
“This is unacceptable,”
the senators write. “Venue operators from our states have contacted our offices expressing considerable frustration with this laggard pace. This frustration is justified. These businesses do not need money next week or next month. They need money today, right now. They needed the money in January and in February and in March, and yet are still waiting for relief in June–almost six months after the SVOG program was authorized by Congress.”
Full text of the letter is available

and below.
June 17, 2021
The Honorable Isabella Casillas Guzman
Administrator
U.S. Small Business Administration
409 3rd Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20416
Dear Administrator Guzman,
We write with serious concern about the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) poor performance in implementing and administering the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program.
As you know, Congress established the SVOG program in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and has provided the program with more than $16 billion in appropriations. This funding was intended to provide critical relief to movie theatres, museums, and other entertainment venues—a sector that has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed upon it by state and local governments.
Unfortunately, this critical relief has yet to be distributed to venue operators. According to the most recent data set published by the SBA on June 14, 2021, venue operators have submitted 14,214 applications requesting $11.5 billion in funding. However, thus far, only 411 grants have been approved for a total of $304.2 million. Remarkably, out of the already-small number of venue operators who have even had their applications approved, only a few have actually receives their grants. This is unacceptable.
Venue operators from our states have contacted our offices expressing considerable frustration with this laggard pace. This frustration is justified. These businesses do not need money next week or next month. They need money today, right now. They needed the money in January and in February and in March, and yet are still waiting for relief in June—almost six months after the SVOG program was authorized by Congress. We urge you to distribute the congressionally authorized relief funding to qualified applicants as soon as possible.
Given the SBA’s poor performance in administering the SVOG program, we request the following information by June 24, 2021:
Please provide a full accounting of how the SBA has used congressionally appropriated funding intended to enhance the agency’s administrative capacity to ensure that SVOG program applications are processed expeditiously without jeopardizing program integrity.
Please provide an estimated timeline of when the SBA will distribute funding to the 411 SVOG program applicants that have had their applications approved.
Please provide an estimated timeline of when the SBA will complete the review process for the 4,982 SVOG program applications currently under review.
Please provide an estimated timeline of when the SBA will begin the review process for the 8,821 SVOG program applications that have been submitted but that are not currently under review. Please provide an estimated timeline of when the SBA will complete the review process for these applications.
Please provide a full accounting of what communication, if any, the SBA has had with the venue operators that have submitted applications to the SVOG program. Please provide details as to whether the SBA is responsive to the venue operators’ requests for updates, and whether the SBA has provided these applicants with an expected timeline of when their applications will be reviewed, processed, and approved.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Reintroduce Taiwan Defense Act
Date: Wednesday, June 16, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will reintroduce the
Taiwan Defense Act
(TDA), following new signs of China’s
increasing belligerence
in the Asia-Pacific and imperial ambitions worldwide. Sen. Hawley’s bill ensures the United States is able to defeat any attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
Originally introduced in June 2020, TDA is cosponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) will be introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
“The Chinese Communist Party wants control of the Indo-Pacific region, starting with Taiwan. We cannot allow Beijing to succeed, not just for the sake of our Asian allies and partners, but for the sake of all Americans whose lives and livelihoods depend on a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“As China continues to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, our military must be prepared to defend our allies and uphold our commitments to trade and diplomatic partners like Taiwan,”
said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation would ensure the U.S. can efficiently and effectively come to Taiwan’s aid in the event China threatens their autonomy.”
Senator Daines said, “We must uphold our commitments to Taiwan and push back against Chinese aggression in the Asia-Pacific and around the world.”
“The United States must remain committed to Taiwan as the Chinese Communist Party continues to build its military forces and threaten Taiwan’s sovereignty,”
said Senator Tillis. “It’s crucial the U.S. Military strengthen its ability to protect Taiwan, and the Biden Administration must build on the work of the Trump Administration to support strong cross-Strait deterrence with increased attention and greater resources. I am proud to work with my colleagues on this legislation so that the DoD can take swift action on this threat.”
“Taiwan’s freedom from the threat of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule is the key to a peaceful, secure, and stable Indo-Pacific,”
said Senator Tuberville. “The CCP knows this and in their mission to become the world’s top superpower, they are taking bold action to strengthen their military and threaten Taiwan. The
Taiwan Defense Act
is central to standing with our allies across the region and combating provocations from the CCP.”
“When senior leaders are warning the CCP could invade Taiwan within the next six years, we need a sense of urgency to restore deterrence in the Taiwan Strait,”
said Representative Gallagher. “Taiwan’s liberty is a vital national security interest of the United States, and the
Taiwan Defense Act
ensures America maintains the capability to deny a CCP invasion.”

Title: Hawley Says Biden’s Open Borders Policies Have Created A “Moral Crisis”
Date: Tuesday, June 15, 2021

Content:
Today, speaking at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said that President Joe Biden has created a “moral crisis” by sending the message that the U.S. Southern border is open. Senator Hawley said the Senate Democrats’ proposed immigration reform plan would create new loopholes for illegal immigrants and devalue legal immigration.
Senator Hawley said,
“I’m glad that we have the opportunity today to talk about what is happening on the border, and to have a chance to look at and examine what is, I think, a humanitarian crisis. It is a national security crisis. It is a drug crisis. It’s also, frankly, a moral crisis.
“When you see what these cartels are doing on our border. When you see the children being exploited and smuggled for profit by these cartels at the border. When you see the lies that these cartels are telling innocent people to get their money and bring them across the border. And when you see the effects of the drugs that are flowing across this border into every community of my state.
“I come from the state of Missouri. You can’t visit a community in my state that is not, frankly, awash in drugs. From where? From across the border.
“Our border is in a state of total crisis, and it is a crisis that is affecting every single person in my state and in this country. And I suggest to you we have a moral obligation—and this administration has a moral obligation—to address the crisis it has created at the border, for children, for families, for American citizens, and I’m glad we get to talk about this.
“You know, the statistics tell the story. I mean, the number of family units crossing the border is up 4,143% from last May. 4,143%.
“That border crossing is not safe. The border is not open. And yet the Biden Administration has sent the message that it is open. And it has effectively encouraged this illegal smuggling. It has encouraged this exploitation of children. It has encouraged the drug crisis we see with its policies.
“That’s a hard truth, but it is the truth. And the American people are owed the truth. And the moral consequences of these policies have to be confronted and addressed and owned up to.
“And I’m afraid I can’t support the legislation we’re considering today because I think it goes in exactly the opposite direction. I think creating new loopholes for illegal immigrants that have criminal records, sending the message that more people ought to come here illegally while devaluing legal immigration is exactly the wrong way to go.”

Title: Hawley Slams Senate China Bill for Cutting Tariffs, Failing to Put American Workers First
Date: Tuesday, June 08, 2021

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) voted against the final passage of the
United States Innovation and Competition Act, which he slammed for cutting tariffs on China and failing to put American workers first or crack down on multi-billion-dollar corporations that are heavily invested in China.
Senator Hawley said, “I can’t support a bill that harms American workers and cuts tariffs on products made in China in the name of ‘increased competition.’ For decades, US policy makers have watched as millions of American jobs were shipped overseas, corporate America sold out to the Chinese Communist Party, and our industrial economy was replaced by slave labor in Xinjiang. We must correct the failed Washington consensus that has allowed Beijing to thrive at the expense of working Americans.”
Senator Hawley
previously called for
amendments to impose a duty of 100 percent on goods made in the Xinjiang Autonomous region, require certain businesses to monitor and disclose the use of forced labor in their supply chains, and prohibit the transfer or licensing of certain intellectual property rights of goods funded by American taxpayers.

Title: Senator Hawley Leads Effort to Condemn Violence Against Jews, Anti-Israel Rhetoric from Politicians and Media
Date: Tuesday, May 25, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a
resolution
condemning hatred and violence against Jews, denouncing anti-Israel rhetoric from elected officials and the media, and reaffirming that Jews must be treated with dignity and respect. Senator Hawley’s resolution has received support from the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Family Research Council. It is cosponsored by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Kennedy (R-La.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.)
“The sickening rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the United States and around the world must end, along with the hateful anti-Israel rhetoric from politicians and the media that inspires the violence.We must ensure that Jewish people receive the full protection of law owed to them as citizens of the United States.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“At a moment when Jews are literally under attack in the streets of our nation, Jewish Americans need to know that Congress is on their side. This resolution provides an opportunity for our elected leaders to take a stand against antisemitism and against the demonization of Israel that fuels it,” said Matt Brooks, Executive Director of the
Republican Jewish Coalition.
“As anti-Semitism continues to rear its ugly head, we must once again remind the world that no one should ever be attacked for their religious beliefs. Whether this occurs at home or abroad, it is wrong, and we must condemn it. This resolution helps do exactly that,”
said the Family Research Council.
Senator Rick Scott said, “The anti-Semitic attacks occurring across our nation are disgusting. This disturbing wave of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel actions in Congress, in the United States and around the world must be swiftly condemned at every level and those responsible prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We must make clear that America will never tolerate this hate and proudly stands with Israel and all of our Jewish communities.”
“Anti-Semitic attacks and rhetoric must be met with a clear voice of condemnation,”
said Senator Braun. “I’m proud to join this strong statement of support for our allies in Israel and Jewish Americans here at home.”
“Attacking someone because of their religious beliefs should never be tolerated. We’ve seen an alarming rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country over the last week in response to the state of Israel exercising its right to defend itself,”
said Senator Tillis.
“Every member of Congress should unequivocally condemn this targeted violence. I am proud to co-sponsor this resolution to affirm our support and protections for Jewish Americans.”
“The rise in Anti-Israel rhetoric and acts of violence against the Jewish community throughout the U.S. are alarming and must stop immediately. This increase in anti-Semitism compels us, now more than ever, to defend the liberty and safety of the Jewish people here at home, and support a free and sovereign Israel abroad,”
said Senator Ernst. “I firmly stand with our ally Israel and our Jewish friends in America and around the world.”
Senator Cruz said, “Antisemitism is a unique prejudice with a unique history, which has resulted in unique horrors throughout history. This wave of abhorrent violence is directed at Jews for being Jewish, just like Hamas is firing rockets into Israel because they want to murder Jews and eliminate the Jewish state. The Senate has
come together in the past
to condemn antisemitism in these terms, without watering down our condemnation by reference to equally abhorrent but different forms of hatred. The Democrat House seems unable to do so, but I am hopeful that we can do so again, and I’m proud to join Sen. Hawley’s resolution.”
“Some say that being anti-Israel doesn’t mean being anti-Semitic, but the two often go hand-in-hand. Since Hamas started lobbing rockets at Israel, we have seen anti-Semites commit numerous acts of violence against Jews in America and abroad. The individuals whose irresponsible words have added to this cloud of hate have no excuse. Israel is America’s ally, and Jewish Americans have played a significant role in making America the great, diverse nation that we are today. We must continue to stand against anti-Semitism,”
said Senator Kennedy.
“The recent violence against Jewish people in America does not reflect the principles of our nation. Unfortunately, this wave of anti-Semitism has been spread through lies and misinformation shared on social media. It’s also been incited by Democrats in Congress who use their position of power to stoke Jewish hatred while rockets rain down upon Israel. Enough is enough.”
said Senator Marshall. “The U.S. stands against anti-Semitism and Jewish racism at home or abroad. We will always speak out against those who use their anti-Israel views to delegitimize Israel and demonize the Jewish people.”
Senator Daines said, “the abominable anti-Israel rhetoric being perpetuated by politicians is leading to violent attacks on Jewish people here in America and across the world—it must stop. We must stand with the Jewish people and Israel, and unequivocally condemn acts of violence and anti-Semitism.”
“In America and around the world, we are seeing Jews being attacked in the streets just because they are Jews, and some of our elected officials are fueling the flames by insufficiently condemning the violence and attacking Israel for defending itself,”
said Senator Cramer. “Anti-Semitism is evil, Israel is our friend, and violence against Jews for being Jewish is vile. The United States needs to unequivocally condemn such abhorrent behavior. I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting our resolution.
“The recent rise in anti-Semitic violence in the United States is unfortunately not surprising given how members of the radical left have refused to condemn the actions of Hamas terrorists,”
said Senator Blackburn. “We must protect the people of Israel and Jewish Americans from this disgusting violence, which starts with speaking out against the rhetoric coming from the left.”
Senator Rubio said, “The horrific spike in Anti-Semitic violence and crimes both in the U.S. and around the world serves as reminder that hateful rhetoric and lies can quickly turn into violence. We must do all we can to combat this ancient evil and ensure America’s Jewish communities are protected.”
“We have seen a sharp increase in attacks against Jewish people, both in America and around the world.  These attacks—fueled by vile and hateful rhetoric against Israel and its people—must end, and the perpetrators must be punished.  We cannot allow anti-Semitic behavior to stand,”
said Senator Crapo.
“I’m proud to stand with Israel and the Jewish community in the United States and around the world, and to co-sponsor this important and timely Senate resolution condemning the rising tide of anti-Semitic violence and rhetoric,”
Senator Hagerty said. “I support Israel’s recent efforts to defend its people from rocket attacks by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorists in Gaza who hide behind human shields and indiscriminately target civilians in Israel. For anyone to use this conflict to discriminate and spread lies against the Jewish people is wholly unacceptable.”
In recent weeks, Jewish people in the United States have been threatened, cursed at, spit on, burned, and physically assaulted in nearly 200 documented attacks since the start of the most recent conflict between Israel and Palestine.
Last week Senator Hawley joined 19 of his colleagues in
introducing
a resolution to stand with Israel and condemn the attacks by Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization. He and 43 colleagues also
sent a letter
to President Biden urging him to stand with Israel and stop negotiating potential sanctions relief to Iran.

Title: Senators Josh Hawley, Kirsten Gillibrand Lead Legislation to Improve Military Response to Sexual Assault
Date: Tuesday, May 25, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)
introduced legislation
to improve the U.S. military’s response to sexual assault. The
Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act
tasks the Department of Defense with evaluating options for establishing a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) military operational specialty (MOS) and reporting its findings and recommendations to Congress. The Hawley-Gillibrand bill comes after the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee reported on growing concerns of SARCs lacking the training and resources needed to be effective at providing support to military sexual assault victims.
“America’s service members make untold sacrifices on our nation’s behalf, and it is our responsibility to ensure those who need support can get it. This legislation would aid the Department of Defense in identifying next steps to professionalize the role of Sexual Assault Response Coordinator throughout all branches of the military — a role that requires adequate training, resources, and support to provide service members with the best care possible.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“To combat the epidemic of sexual assault in our military we must professionalize every part of the military justice system, including Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs). SARCs are an essential part of the front lines of combating military sexual assault and Congress has a duty to ensure SARCs have the training, resources, and independence to support our men and women in uniform,” s
aid U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. “I’m proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation as we work to eradicate the scourge of sexual assault in our military.”
“Securing justice for survivors of sexual assault and abuse is critical,”
said Senator Cramer. “Our legislation would give Congress and the Defense Department the information they need to professionalize the role of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators in the military and ensure the best resources and training are provided to support victims of sexual assault.”
“I am pleased to be a cosponsor and vote in favor of  S. 1520, legislation that is well overdue, and will make great strides to support victims of Sexual Assault in the military,”
said Senator Ben Cardin. “Our bipartisan legislation will allow victims of sexual assaults to have more privacy, will incentivize victims to report more cases, and increase the prevention of sexual assaults and other crimes in the military. Our troops already sacrifice so much to protect this nation, they need to know Congress prioritizes their personal safety and security.”
“Survivors of sexual assault should have the best possible care. In order to ensure that, the military needs trained professionals helping support men and women after these horrific events, and this bipartisan effort will help us do that,”
said Senator Ernst.
More information on the
Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act
is below and the full text of the legislation can be found
here.
Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act
Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) form the backbone of the United States military’s efforts to provide sexual assault victims with the support they need, from medical treatment to legal assistance. These first-line responders play an essential role in our military’s response to sexual assault, but they often lack the training and resources they need to be effective. The Fort Hood Independent Review Committee report highlighted these concerns, as did recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Personnel.
The
Professionalizing the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Act
addresses these challenges by tasking the Department of Defense to evaluate and report on the optimal execution of a SARC MOS across all branches of the military. The Act mandates, in particular, that the evaluation and report address the following considerations:
The appropriate rank and level of experience for prospective recipients of a SARC MOS.
Strengthening incentives for high-performing service members to obtain and serve as a SARC MOS, including by designating the SARC MOS as a secondary MOS.
Options for standardizing training and education for SARC MOSs.
Requirements for SARC-specific chain of command to provide service members serving as SARC MOSs with required support and guidance.
The impact of creating a SARC MOS on existing SARC programming.
The evaluation and report mandated by this Act will ensure Congress and the Department of Defense have the information required to professionalize the SARC role, so that SARCs have the training and other resources they need to provide the most effective support possible to victims of sexual assault.

Title: Hawley Pushes for Amendments to Senate China Bill to Put American Workers First, Fight Beijing’s Trade Abuses
Date: Tuesday, May 25, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced seven amendments to the
United States Innovation and Competition Act
—the Senate’s proposed legislation to increase competitiveness with China—to put American workers first, fight back against Beijing’s trade abuses, stand up for human rights, protect American national security, and crack down on multi-billion-dollar corporations that are heavily invested in China.
“This week, Congress has a chance to begin to correct two decades of failed policies that have allowed China to thrive at the expense of the American heartland. That means putting American workers first, ending corporate reliance on Chinese slave labor, and weaning Wall Street off their dependence on the Chinese Communist Party. That also means holding the CCP accountable for their role in the outbreak of the pandemic in Wuhan. We can’t let this opportunity pass.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley’s amendments would:
Impose a duty of 100 percent on goods made in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a region notorious for slave labor and other human rights violations;
Require a label marking clothing, household goods, and other articles imported into the U.S. that originate in countries believed to produce goods made by forced or child labor;
Prohibit the transfer or licensing of certain intellectual property rights of goods funded by American taxpayers through this bill;
Require certain businesses to monitor and disclose the use of forced labor in their supply chains (
Slave-Free Business Certification Act
);
Require contractors to notify the Department of Defense if certain information systems they provide to DoD contain printed circuit boards from China;
Impose data security requirements and strengthen review of foreign investments with respect to certain technology companies (
National Security And Personal Data Protection Act
);
Require the Director of National Intelligence to declassify information relating to the origin of COVID-19 (
COVID-19 Origin Act
).

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Stabilize USPS and Promote Long-Term Sustainable Service
Date: Thursday, May 20, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and 17 other colleagues to introduce bipartisan legislation to set the United States Postal Service on a more sustainable financial footing and support the goal of providing long-term reliable service across the country. The bill strengthens transparency and accountability for Postal Service performance, eliminates unnecessary financial burdens, and helps ensure the Postal Service can better serve the American people. A bipartisan companion bill was approved by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week.
“The United States Postal Service has been around for nearly 250 years and we must ensure it can survive for another 250. With these bipartisan reforms, we can help put the Postal Service on a path to self-sustaining financial viability that will secure six-day service, protect rural delivery, and ensure that all Americans have reliable, uninterrupted access to their mail.”
Senator Josh Hawley
The Postal Service Reform Act would eliminate the aggressive prefunding requirement that has hurt the Postal Service financially, and integrate postal worker retirees’ health care with Medicare. Together, these two reforms would create $45.9 billion in savings for the Postal Service over the next ten years. In addition, the bill would require the Postal Service to maintain its standard of delivering at least six days a week. The legislation would improve transparency of Postal Service operations to both customers and Congress by requiring the publication of easily accessible weekly service data on the Postal Service website, as well as issuing a detailed report to Congress every six months on Postal Service finances and operations. The bill also includes bipartisan provisions for Postal Service accountability and growth.

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Urge Biden to Stand with Israel and to Not Provide Iran with Sanctions Relief
Date: Thursday, May 13, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and 43 of his Republican colleagues
sent a letter
urging President Joe Biden to stand with Israel. While Israel remains under attack from Iranian-backed terrorists, the Biden Administration is negotiating and potentially offering sanctions relief to Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The Senators called on President Biden to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided. The Senators highlighted that “[t]he United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies.”
“Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel,” the senators wrote. “They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel’s capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.”

The
full text of the letter
is below.
Dear Mr. President:
We write with regard to the ongoing rocket attacks against Israel by the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas. Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel. They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel’s capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. In light of these recent attacks by Hamas against Israel, the United States should take all steps necessary to hold Tehran accountable and under no circumstances, provide sanctions relief to Iran. This is especially important as Iran is supporting terrorist activity against the United States’ closest ally in the region, Israel.
As you know, Palestinian terrorist groups launched more than 1,000 rockets targeting Israel over the last few days alone. This includes the first rockets aimed at Jerusalem since 2014. While the United States and countries around the world condemned these rocket attacks, Iran resoundingly supports this aggression. Shortly after the attacks began, and as they continued, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted that Palestinians should unite to “use the tools of their disposal” to attack Israel, which he recently called not a nation, but a “terrorist garrison.” Even the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, who currently is supervising Iran’s negotiating team in Vienna, called Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh to express Iran’s support for the group’s actions.
The United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization in 1997 and as such, is prohibited from providing any funds to Hamas. Iran, however, is a longtime financial and material supporter of Hamas. The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies. We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided. Doing so would demonstrate a firm commitment to our closest ally in the region and to our own security interests.
The United States must not do anything to enrich Israel’s enemies, such as by offering sanctions relief to a regime that seeks to destroy Israel. As a longtime friend of the Jewish state, we also urge you to unequivocally support Israel’s right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks.
Respectfully,

Title: Sen. Hawley’s Legislation to Ban TikTok on Government Devices Unanimously Passes Committee
Date: Wednesday, May 12, 2021

Content:
Today the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously passed U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bill
to ban TikTok on government devices. Senator Hawley’s bill is cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
“TikTok is an immediate security threat that has no place on government devices. This should not be a partisan issue and I’m glad to see my colleagues in the Senate act together to address Beijing’s covert data collection campaign. Banning TikTok from government devices is a good first step towards taking Chinese espionage seriously.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Scott said, “I applaud the Committee’s unanimous passage of our legislation to ban the use of TikTok, which is connected to the Chinese Communist Party, by federal employees on government devices. Communist China has shown again and again that it will stop at nothing to infiltrate our government networks and steal American technology. Today’s passage is a critical step to protecting our national security.”
“There is absolutely no reason why TikTok, an application that Beijing can use to collect Americans’ personal data, should be available on government devices,”
Senator Rubio said. “I am glad to see the Senate finally moving forward on this issue.”
Senator Cotton said, “TikTok gathers and then stores private information on servers accessible by the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok shouldn’t be allowed on government devices, and I’m pleased to see our bill advance out of committee.”
Senator Hawley originally introduced the
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
in March 2020, following a Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing he chaired, entitled “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing,” when
TikTok refused to testify. In August 2020, the bill
passed the Senate unanimously.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Bill to Defend U.S. Circuit Boards From Chinese Exploitation, Strengthen Supply Chain
Date: Wednesday, April 28, 2021

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced the
Protecting Critical Boards and Electronics Through Transparency and Enduring Reinvestment (PCBETTER) Act
to prevent Beijing from inserting and exploiting vulnerabilities in printed circuit boards (PCBs) that are made in China and used throughout the American military.
“Chinese printed circuit boards pose a serious threat to the integrity of America’s defense systems. It is imperative that we give the Department of Defense the tools it needs to secure its printed circuit board supply chains, so that our warfighters can have full confidence in the weapons they rely on to protect our nation.”
Senator Josh Hawley
A disproportionate amount of the PCBs used in the DoD’s electronic systems come from China, where they are vulnerable to sabotage by the Chinese government. The
PCBETTER Act
will help to secure the DoD’s PCB supply chains by:
Authorizing a ten-year fund
to strengthen American PCB and other microelectronics manufacturing and support implementation of critical supply chain security initiatives.
Requiring contractors to inform the DoD if certain information systems contain PCBs made in China
or other adversary nations, so the Department can focus vulnerability detection and mitigation efforts on those systems.
Establishing a testing, remediation, and prevention regime
to address vulnerabilities in information systems that contain or may contain PCBs made in China or other adversary nations.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Parent Tax Credit—Historic Relief for Working Families
Date: Monday, April 26, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced legislation to create the
Parent Tax Credit, a historic tax cut to help working parents afford to start a family and raise their children. Through a fully refundable tax credit provided directly through automatic, monthly advances, Senator Hawley’s
Parent Tax Credit
gives working parents the flexibility they need to make the best choices for raising their families.
“Starting a family and raising children should not be a privilege only reserved for the wealthy. Millions of working people want to start a family and would like to care for their children at home, but current policies do not respect these preferences. American families should be supported, no matter how they choose to care for their kids.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Although most American families believe children are better off when one parent stays home to care for them, current federal childcare programs and policies force both parents into the labor market and require children be enrolled in formal commercial childcare. Senator Hawley’s legislation creates a fully refundable tax credit of $6,000 for single parents and $12,000 for married parents with qualifying children.
The
Parent Tax Credit
Over the past several decades it has become increasingly difficult for working- and middle-class parents to afford to raise a family. Take childcare: Although most American families believe children are better off when one parent stays home to care for them, often both mom and dad feel they must enter the workforce to be able to afford kids.
Current law doesn’t help. Existing federal childcare programs and policies—such as the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit—actually require both parents to enter the labor market in order to receive the benefits. These polices also require that children be enrolled in formal commercial childcare. And they frequently reserve the greatest benefits for upper-income earners. Current law does little or nothing for the millions of working families who would prefer to care for their children at home.
Senator Hawley believes that American families should be supported, no matter how they choose to care for their kids. That is why he is proposing one of the biggest tax cuts for working families in American history. The
Parent Tax Credit
is a fully refundable benefit for families provided directly through automatic, monthly advances. This new credit does not tilt the deck in favor of two-earner households or formal childcare arrangements. The
Parent Tax Credit
gives working families the flexibility to make the best choices for raising their family.
Credit Amount
For households with a qualifying child, the
Parent Tax Credit
is worth $6,000 for single parents and $12,000 for married parents that file a joint tax return. There is no income phase-out. Households that fulfill the eligibility parameters outlined below receive the full benefit.
Eligibility
The
Parent Tax Credit
is available to households with a qualifying child under the age of 13. To receive the credit, single-parent households must report prior-year earnings equal to or greater than earned income from 20 hours per week of work at the federal minimum wage, an earnings threshold of $7,540. Married parents that file a joint tax return must reach the same earnings threshold. This creates an explicit marriage bonus of 100 percent. In order to receive the credit, tax returns must include the Social Security Number of parents and qualifying children.
Delivery
Payments are advanced by the IRS on a monthly basis. The IRS is instructed to establish an online portal allowing families to make changes to relevant information, including the number of qualifying children, marital status, and earned income. Families can also choose to opt out of monthly payments, and can instead receive a lump-sum return when they file their federal taxes.

Title: Hawley, Braun Introduce Bill Requiring Biden to Declassify Wuhan Lab Leak Intelligence
Date: Thursday, April 22, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced the
COVID-19 Origin Act of 2021
to require the Biden administration to declassify intelligence related to any potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the origins of the Covid pandemic.
“For over a year, anyone asking questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been branded as a conspiracy theorist. The world needs to know if this pandemic was the product of negligence at the Wuhan lab but the CCP has done everything it can to block a credible investigation. That’s why the Biden administration must declassify what it knows about the Wuhan lab and Beijing’s attempts to cover up the origin of the pandemic.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Braun said, “Identifying the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is vital for preventing future pandemics, and as investigations and research into the origins of the virus continue, the Biden administration should declassify intelligence related to any potential links between biological research laboratories in Wuhan, China and the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield
recently said
he believes Covid originated at WIV and the
Washington Post Editorial Board
has called on the Biden administration to declassify any intelligence relating to the lab.
In March 2020, Senator Hawley was the first member of Congress to call for
an international investigation
into China’s cover-up of the spread of coronavirus and, in April 2020,
introduced legislation
to allow American citizens to sue the Chinese government for damages.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for Federal Agencies to Return to Work and Resume Full Duties
Date: Tuesday, April 20, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) calling for federal agencies to resume in-person operations at field offices and get back to the work of serving the American people. The letter comes after reports from Missourians that certain agencies have been nonresponsive or have continued to defer basic services, despite tens of millions of Americans having been fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Many of these complaints have been directed at the National Personnel Records Center, which is based in St. Louis and houses military records for veterans nation-wide, and also the Social Security Administration.
“Over the past several weeks, my constituents have reported that certain federal agency offices are nonresponsive,”
Senator Hawley wrote. “Putting services for Missourians on the back-burner is unacceptable, especially given the fact that the rest of Missouri has largely returned to work. My constituents should have access to basic government services; if these services are not adequately provided remotely, then it’s incumbent upon you and agency leadership to find another solution. Remote work cannot become a permanent reality for the field offices that need to interact with Missourians every day.”

Acting Director
Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

Washington, DC 20415
Dear Acting Director Young and Acting Director McGettigan:
I write to request that you promptly issue new guidance to federal agencies that will allow for the resumption of in-person operations where necessary to fully serve constituents. I’ve recently been contacted by many of my constituents in Missouri who are having serious difficulty receiving basic services from the federal government because certain agencies are limiting in-person operations due to self-imposed restrictions related to COVID-19. As vaccinations increase nationwide, it is time to safely resume in-person services at field offices that interact directly with constituents.
Over the past several weeks, my constituents have reported that certain federal agency offices are nonresponsive. While these complaints are widespread across agencies, particular concern has been directed at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and local offices of the Social Security Administration (SSA). For example, constituents in Missouri are being met with a response from the NPRC that the agency is “servicing only urgent requests related to medical emergencies and burials” and that constituents should consider “delaying [their requests] until we are past this national emergency.” In addition, constituents have complained about long wait times for even phone appointments at SSA offices.
Putting services for Missourians on the back-burner is unacceptable, especially given the fact that the rest of Missouri has largely returned to work. My constituents should have access to basic government services; if these services are not adequately provided remotely, then it’s incumbent upon you and agency leadership to find another solution. Remote work cannot become a permanent reality for the field offices that need to interact with Missourians every day.
While I appreciate the extraordinary circumstances under which federal employees have operated over the past year, I believe the time has come to safely return to the office. To help facilitate this, Congress has appropriated substantial sums of money over the past year to help agencies respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. I urge you to immediately issue new guidance that provides a pathway for agencies to fully and promptly reopen, along with any appropriate protective measures for the workplace to help this occur safely.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
US Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces the Bust Up Big Tech Act
Date: Monday, April 19, 2021

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Bust Up Big Tech Act, new legislation to restore accountability and competition to Big Tech. Senator Hawley’s bill would break up Big Tech companies seeking to dominate multiple industries simultaneously, by banning companies like Amazon from marketing their own retail goods alongside those of other sellers or providing online hosting or cloud services to an ever-growing swath of the internet—including competitors. The law would also empower the FTC to monitor compliance and strengthen antitrust enforcement.
“Woke Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon have been coddled by Washington politicians for years. This treatment has allowed them to amass colossal amounts of power that they use to censor political opinions they don’t agree with and shut out competitors who offer consumers an alternative to the status quo. It’s past time to bust up Big Tech companies, restore competition, and give the power back to the American consumers.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Last week, Senator Hawley introduced the
Trust Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act, which will crack down on mergers and acquisitions by mega-corporations and strengthen antitrust enforcement to pursue the breakup of dominant, anticompetitive firms.
The
Bust Up Big Tech Act
will:
Ban major companies in the business of offering search engines, marketplaces, and exchanges from competing with third-party vendors by selling, advertising, or promoting their own competing goods and services on their sites
Example:
Amazon should not be able to own Amazon Marketplace and sell their own Amazon products on their marketplace against other competitors.
Ban major companies in the business of offering search engines, marketplaces, and exchanges from expanding their power and creating anticompetitive conflicts of interest by providing the online hosting and internet infrastructure services for third parties
Example:
Amazon cannot continue to operate an overwhelmingly dominant retail business and simultaneously own an enormous share of the cloud computing technology upon which the internet itself is built.
Empower the Federal Trade Commission to hire sufficient staff to monitor compliance
Ensure the antitrust laws are actually enforced, by authorizing state attorneys general and private citizens to bring civil actions to ensure compliance

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Reintroduce Legislation to Ban TikTok from Government Devices
Date: Thursday, April 15, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
reintroduced
his legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. Despite reports that TikTok is
a unique threat to data security, the Biden administration
shelved plans by the Trump administration
to force a sale of TikTok’s American operations. Text of the legislation, cosponsored by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), can be
found here.
“TikTok is a Trojan Horse for the Chinese Communist Party that has no place on government devices—or any American devices, for that matter.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“My bill is a straightforward plan to protect American government data from a hostile foreign power, which, less than a year ago, passed the Senate unanimously. TikTok has repeatedly proven itself to be a malicious actor but Joe Biden and Big Tech refuse to take the threat of Chinese espionage seriously. It’s time for Congress to act.”
“TikTok poses a potential threat to personal privacy and our national security interests,”
Senator Rubio said. “There is absolutely no reason why this application, which Beijing can use to advance its malign foreign policy initiatives, should be utilized on federal devices. In its current form, this platform is not safe. I’m proud to join Senators Hawley and Scott in introducing this bill.”
Senator Scott said, “We cannot allow federal employees to jeopardize U.S. government networks and national security by using apps like TikTok, which are connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Communist China has shown again and again that it will stop at nothing to infiltrate our government networks and steal American technology and intellectual property. I’m proud to join Senator Hawley on this important legislation and hope our colleagues will join us in quickly passing the
No TikTok on Government Devices Act.”
“The
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
is in the best interest of our national security. Chinese-owned apps are required to report user data to the Chinese Communist Party, that is why we cannot trust TikTok with the sensitive data that exists on U.S. government devices,”
Representative Buck said. “It is well past time to acknowledge the serious cybersecurity threat that TikTok poses and enact a federal government-wide ban on the Chinese app.”
Senator Hawley originally introduced the
No TikTok on Government Devices Act
in March 2020, following a Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing he chaired, entitled “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing,” when
TikTok refused to testify. In August 2020, the bill

The State Department, the
Department of Homeland Security, the
Department of Defense, and

Title: Senators Hawley, Blunt Urge FEMA to Open Mass Vaccination Site in Kansas City

Missouri U.S. Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt
sent a letter
today to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) urging the establishment of a mass vaccination site in Kansas City, Mo., through the Federal Pilot Community Vaccination Centers (CVC) program. The letter comes after recent requests to FEMA from Governor Mike Parson and Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
“As the vaccine rollout continues, we are mindful that easy access to the vaccine close to home is one of the best ways to ensure that everyone who wants a vaccine can receive it,”
the senators write.
“With this month’s announcement that FEMA will help operate a vaccination site in the City of St. Louis for eight weeks, we believe that a parallel effort in Kansas City will facilitate more vaccine access for more Missourians, especially for individuals at high risk for the disease living in the region.”

Mr. Robert Fenton
Senior Official Performing the Duties of Acting Administrator

Dear Mr. Fenton:
We write in support of recent requests from Governor Mike Parson and Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City that FEMA establish a vaccination site in Kansas City through its Federal Pilot Community Vaccination Centers (CVC) program. We believe that a federally-supported center will complement existing efforts and help increase access to the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the region.
As the vaccine rollout continues, we are mindful that easy access to the vaccine close to home is one of the best ways to ensure that everyone who wants a vaccine can receive it. Drawing upon an additional vaccine supply from the federal government, a CVC will help to build upon the current rollout and allow more flexibility for both residents seeking the vaccine and state and local officials working on distribution. With this month’s announcement that FEMA will help operate a vaccination site in the City of St. Louis for eight weeks, we believe that a parallel effort in Kansas City will facilitate more vaccine access for more Missourians, especially for individuals at high risk for the disease living in the region.
Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request to help accelerate Missouri’s recovery from the pandemic.

Title: Sen. Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Subject MLB to Antitrust Laws
Date: Wednesday, April 14, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have introduced a bill to remove the antitrust exemption that has been in place for Major League Baseball to subject them to existing law. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), with over 20 cosponsors, has produced companion legislation in the House.
“MLB and woke mega-corporations have been coddled by government for too long,”
said Sen. Hawley. “For decades, the MLB has been given a sweetheart deal by Washington politicians. But if they’d prefer to be partisan political activists instead, maybe it’s time to rethink that. With their capitulation to the left-wing Twitter mob and support for Biden’s big lie about election integrity, they’ve forfeited any right to an anti-trust exemption. They must be held to the same standard as the rest of American business.”
Senator Hawley’s comments from the press conference announcing the bill are available
here.
“Consumers benefit when businesses compete, and baseball is no different. In fact, a professional sports league should understand best of all the benefits of competition,”
said Sen. Lee. “Instead, Major League Baseball has used its judicially fabricated antitrust immunity to suppress wages and divide up markets for decades—conduct that is plainly illegal, and sometimes criminal, in any other industry. We should have done this decades ago, but when billion-dollar businesses start engaging in political extortion it becomes even more pressing to end their special treatment.”
“For nearly a century, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from antitrust laws that other professional sports leagues do not,”
said Sen. Cruz. “Major League Baseball asks for your ID when you pick up tickets at will-call, but they have made it clear they oppose photo ID requirements to vote. If Major League Baseball is going to act dishonestly and spread lies about Georgia’s voting rights bill to favor one party against the other, they shouldn’t expect to continue to receive special benefits from Congress.”
“A corporation that happily does business with the communist regimes in Cuba and China but caves to woke CEOs who want to punish states with Voter ID does not deserve any special immunities in antitrust law,”
said Sen. Blackburn.
“For decades, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from the same antitrust laws that govern other businesses in our nation,”
Sen. Rubio said.
“The league has been able to escape scrutiny in part thanks to its perception as a good-faith guardian of America’s national pastime. But with its reprehensible decision to play politics and punish the State of Georgia – and countless small and minority-owned Georgian businesses – by moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, the MLB has shown its willingness to use its market power, derived from its antitrust exemption, irresponsibly. Now, Congress is obligated to revisit this unique treatment.”
“Major League Baseball has enjoyed constitutionally questionable antitrust protections for a century, yet it has decided to act in a partisan manner by punishing the state of Georgia for completely reasonable voter integrity and election security legislation,”
said. Rep. Duncan. “Commissioner Manfred’s decision was ill-advised and will cost Atlanta small businesses, many of which are minority-owned, around $100M in economic activity. Furthermore, public polling has consistently shown overwhelming bipartisan support for voter ID laws, which are the cornerstone of the Georgia elections reform bill. This is just the latest in a wave of corporate decisions to ‘Go Woke.’ If companies or organizations want to undermine efforts to ensure the integrity of our elections process, then they invite increased scrutiny of their business practices. I urge Major League Baseball to reconsider this short-sighted decision, and I urge my colleagues to stand strong against the onslaught of the Woke Left on daily American life.”

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces The ‘Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act’: A Plan to Bust Up Anti-Competitive Big Businesses
Date: Monday, April 12, 2021

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act, new legislation to take back control from big business and return it to the American people. Senator Hawley’s bill will crack down on mergers and acquisitions by mega-corporations and strengthen antitrust enforcement to pursue the breakup of dominant, anticompetitive firms.
“A small group of woke mega-corporations control the products Americans can buy, the information Americans can receive, and the speech Americans can engage in. These monopoly powers control our speech, our economy, our country, and their control has only grown because Washington has aided and abetted their quest for endless power.
Senator Josh Hawley
“While Big Tech, Big Banks, Big Telecom, and Big Pharma gobbled up more companies and more market share, they gobbled up our freedom and competition. American consumers and workers have paid the price. Woke corporations want to run this country and Washington is happy to let them. It’s time to bust up them up and restore competition.”
The
Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act will:
Ban all mergers and acquisitions by companies with market capitalization exceeding $100 billion
Example: Google could not purchase Waze and incorporate it into the Maps app
Empower the FTC to designate “dominant digital firms” exercising dominant market power in particular internet markets, which will be prohibited from buying out potential competitors
Example: Facebook’s dominance in social networking should prevent it from acquiring startups seeking to build new social media platforms
Prohibit dominant digital firms from privileging their own search results over those of competitors without explicit disclosure
Example: Google could not promote its own reviews over Yelp reviews without disclosing the affiliation up front
Reform the Sherman and Clayton Acts to make clear that direct evidence of anticompetitive conduct is sufficient to support an antitrust claim, which will allow enforcers to effectively pursue the breakup of dominant firms and prevent antitrust cases from devolving into battles between economists
Example: Facebook’s complete acquisition of a major competitor, Instagram, should be sufficient to justify antitrust action without needing to bring in specialists to define the “social networking market”
Replace the outdated numerically-focused standard for evaluating antitrust cases, which allows giant conglomerates to escape scrutiny by focusing on short-term considerations, with a standard emphasizing the protection of competition in the U.S.
Clarify that “vertical” mergers are not exempt from antitrust scrutiny
Example: Amazon could not acquire additional companies in its supply chain
Drastically increase antitrust penalties by requiring companies that lose federal antitrust suits to forfeit all their profits resulting from monopolistic conduct

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Legislation Defending Universities from the Chinese Communist Party’s Influence
Date: Wednesday, April 07, 2021

U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in introducing the Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act.
The Chinese Communist Party funds and operates 55 Confucius Institutes at colleges and universities across America. They allow the CCP to influence what college students are taught and obstruct the freedom of speech on campuses. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the CCP,
stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.”
“Confucius Institutes allow the Chinese regime to funnel propaganda into American universities under the guise of educational enrichment. It’s long past time that this is made clear to Americans up front, and that anyone involved with these centers face background checks. Anything else would be an abdication of our national security efforts,”
Senator Hawley
Senator Hawley
has previously asked
Missouri universities to reconsider their partnerships with the Confucius Institutes and
commended
the University of Missouri for shutting down its Confucius Institute.
The Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require program participation agreements between the CCP agency which administers educational programs, known as the Hanban, and American institutions to address the ways in which Beijing exerts undue influence through Confucius Institutes, including:
Clearly delineating between the Confucius Institutes’ programs and their own Chinese language programs;
Locating an Institute apart from these departments;
Removing the Chinese assistant director position from Institutes;
Removing the confidentiality section of agreements;
Making the agreements publicly available online; and
Including stronger language in the agreements to make it clearer that the U.S. school has executive decision-making authority.

Title: Hawley Calls for Biden to Extend Freeze on Foreign Worker Visas
Date: Wednesday, March 31, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to President Joe Biden urging him to extend President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing visas for certain temporary foreign workers, which will expire today, March 31, 2021, unless President Biden acts. Senator Hawley writes that the temporary freeze, issued to protect American workers during the pandemic, should be extended until the unemployment rate has meaningfully declined and the Biden administration has ensured that American workers are fully protected.
“In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labor market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for U.S. workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.”

President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President:
I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the U.S. has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work – and millions more desperate to make ends meet – now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources.
As you know, in June of 2020 the Trump administration issued Proclamation 10052 as a part of the coronavirus response effort. [

] The proclamation suspended entry to the United States of applicants for several temporary or “nonimmigrant” visa categories that presented a risk to the U.S. labor market during the economic recovery. On December 31, 2020, the administration extended the order to March 31, 2021, [
2
] noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American’s lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the United States.
These challenges persist today. The unemployment rate remains at 6.2 percent – with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. [
3
] The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis – and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions.
In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labor market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for U.S. workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.
I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of nonimmigrant visa programs to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm. In the meantime, I will continue to work to develop legislative solutions that will protect American workers and promote a quick recovery.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Former St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn Receives Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Award
Date: Thursday, March 25, 2021

Content:
Today the Congressional Medal of Honor Society
announced
retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn would be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Award for his courage when he was mortally wounded while saving his friend’s business from looters during the riots in St. Louis last June. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) nominated him for this award.
The Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Award is given to outstanding Americans who have gone above and beyond to perform extraordinary acts of courage or service. David Dorn is honored with the “Single Act of Heroism Award,” an award recognizing Americans who accomplish extraordinary feats of heroism by risking their lives for the benefit of others in a dire situation.
“David Dorn was dedicated to helping others and protecting his community, even after he retired from law enforcement and through his last moments with us. His character represents the absolute best of Missouri and this country.”
Senator Hawley
“This award may be rare, but the exceptional courage and devotion of Officer Dorn is shared by his brothers and sisters in blue who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Our local law enforcement officers deserve our sincerest gratitude for protecting our communities every single day.”
Last summer, the Senate
adopted
a resolution sponsored by Senators Hawley and Blunt to honor the life of Officer Dorn. Senator Hawley
recently cosponsored
legislation to create federal penalties for individuals who deliberately target local, state, or federal law enforcement officers with violence.
Text of Senator Hawley’s letter nominating Officer Dorn is below:
In the early morning hours of June 2, 2020, David Dorn learned that his friend’s business was being ransacked by looters. So in the middle of the night, David promptly left the safety of his St. Louis home to save his friend’s livelihood and protect his community.
David Dorn was a father to five children, a grandfather to ten grandchildren, and loving husband to Ann Dorn. Before retiring in 2014, David spent 38 years serving his neighbors as a police officer and was a well-known pillar of his community.
When David arrived at his friend’s business, indeed, seven burglars were looting the shop. A gunman opened fire on David Dorn, mortally wounding him on the sidewalk. This senseless act of violence was streamed live on social media, where his own grandson watched in horror.
His tragic death galvanized the people of St. Louis and two days later, they gathered to honor David Dorn and participated in a march to end violence.
The actions of David Dorn are in keeping with Missouri’s finest traditions of selfless service and reflect great credit upon himself, his community, and the entire State of Missouri.
Therefore, Senator Josh Hawley is honored to nominate David Dorn for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society’s, 2020 Citizen Honors Award.
Background
Each year only five U.S. citizens receive a Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Award. These five individuals and one organization exemplify the values embodied in the Medal of Honor: courage, sacrifice, commitment, integrity, citizenship, and patriotism.
A panel assembled by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society considers all nominations and selects national finalists. Then a second panel made up exclusively of Medal of Honor Recipients selects individuals from those finalists to receive the Citizen Honors Awards.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Call for Judiciary Hearing on Obama-Biden FTC’s Sweetheart Deal with Google
Date: Thursday, March 18, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sent letters to Federal Trade Commission Acting Chair (FTC) Rebecca Slaughter and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) calling for a public Judiciary Hearing into
recent revelations
that the Obama-Biden FTC failed to enforce antitrust law in an 2011 investigation of Google and instead let the company off with a slap on the wrist. The senators call for testimony from Google executives and relevant FTC officials, including the former Commissioners who now represent big tech firms.
The senators write, “The FTC’s inaction has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy. In the intervening years, Google has amassed—and exploited—an ever-growing market share in search and digital advertising and smartphones, and has used these dominant positions to make inroads into other product lines and services. As distressing as these consequences may be, the FTC’s inaction has had consequences far beyond the actions and market power of a single firm. The FTC’s failure to enforce the nation’s antitrust laws signaled to similarly dominant market participants, in tech or elsewhere, that compliance is optional. In other words, lax enforcement of our laws encourages lawlessness. Regulators responsible for this era of underenforcement, which has resulted in unprecedented economic concentration, must be held to account, on the record.”

Dear Chairman Durbin,
We write to request that you schedule a full Committee hearing immediately on major new revelations regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust investigation into Google. It is critical that the Committee conduct oversight into enforcement—or underenforcement—of our nation’s antitrust laws. I ask that you use your authority as Chairman to call Google executives and relevant FTC officials to publicly testify, including the former Commissioners who now represent big tech firms. Today, we are also sending a letter to FTC Acting Chair Rebecca Kelly Slaughter urging her to dispatch relevant officials to Congress as soon as possible.
Recent reporting from Politico details previously undisclosed internal memorandums from FTC lawyers and economists, written from 2011 to 2013 during the agency’s investigation into Google’s business practices. [
1
] The reporting confirms what has become increasingly apparent in recent years: confronted with the most consequential antitrust case in a generation, and ample evidence of market dominance and misconduct, the nation’s antitrust enforcers failed to act. Instead, after a 19-month investigation, the Obama Administration’s FTC agreed to a non-binding sweetheart deal proposed by Google itself. This is outrageous.
The FTC’s inaction has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy.

Dear Acting Chair Slaughter,
We write regarding major new revelations regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust investigation into Google, and its determination not to pursue enforcement actions in accordance with the nation’s antitrust laws. Today, we also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary demanding a hearing on this matter, and expect FTC officials to appear before Congress to publicly testify about the decision not to pursue enforcement.
Not since the Gilded Age have so few firms dominated such large swaths of the U.S. economy. Recent reporting from Politico provides some insight into the regulatory failures that allowed for the current state of affairs to metastasize. [

Rather than enforce the antitrust laws enacted by Congress, the Obama Administration’s FTC, after a 19-month investigation, instead agreed to a non-binding sweetheart deal proposed by Google itself. This is outrageous.
Unsurprisingly, this regulatory slap on the wrist did little to discourage the tech firm from deploying anticompetitive practices in its quest for monopoly power. In the intervening years, Google has amassed an ever-growing market share in search and digital advertising and smartphones, and has exploited that market power to make inroads into other product lines and services, oftentimes discriminating against its competitors. As distressing as these consequences may be, the FTC’s inaction has had consequences far beyond the market power of a single firm or the market concentration of a single industry. The FTC’s failure to enforce the nation’s antitrust laws signaled to similarly dominant market participants, in tech or elsewhere, that compliance is optional. In other words, lax enforcement of our laws encourages lawlessness. This has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy.
The regulators responsible for this era of underenforcement must be held to account, under oath. We urge you to cooperate with congressional efforts to conduct oversight into enforcement—or, underenforcement—of our nation’s antitrust laws.

Title: Hawley Calls on Biden Admin. to Reinstate Public Charge Rule & Enforce Immigration Laws
Date: Tuesday, March 16, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas urging him to reverse course and enforce the public charge rule, an immigration law which bars illegal immigrants deemed reliant on welfare from entering the country and extending visas. Despite being in the middle of a pandemic that has created an economic fallout, the Biden administration stopped enforcing the rule last week and began automatically granting residency to welfare-dependent illegal immigrants on the taxpayers’ dime.
Senator Hawley wrote,
“We are in the middle of a national pandemic, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet, and there is a burgeoning crisis at the border. Under conditions like these, this is perhaps the worst imaginable time to gut this important safeguard. By creating a fresh incentive for foreign migrants to surge across our southern border, your actions reflect a profound misunderstanding of the plight of American workers and communities across the country, and threaten to further exacerbate an already severe humanitarian disaster.”
Read his full letter
here
or below.
The Honorable Alejandro N. Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C. 20528
Dear Secretary Mayorkas:
On March 11, 2021, your department reversed recent changes to the “public charge” rule – a Trump-era policy that sought to enforce existing immigration law.
[1]
The rule stipulates that the majority of noncitizen immigrants deemed likely to become dependent on public assistance should not be allowed to enter the United States or change their visa status to remain longer in the country. I write today to urge you to reinstate those changes.
As you undoubtedly know, current immigration law provides that any alien (with exceptions for especially vulnerable individuals) who is “likely at any time to become a public charge” becomes inadmissible for a visa to the United States or adjustment of visa status.
[2]
In keeping with that law, in August of 2019, the Trump administration issued a final rule clarifying the terms of the existing statute and outlining the factors that the Department of Homeland Security would consider when making a “public charge” determination.
[3]
Among other things, the rule included a requirement that any alien seeking an extension of stay or status change should show that they had not been consistently dependent on public assistance, including cash benefits as well as in-kind benefits such as Medicaid, housing vouchers, and food stamps. Contrary to the apocalyptic tone of some media coverage, the rule clarified that these limitations do not apply to asylees and several other vulnerable populations outlined in the underlying statute and rule. Rather, such a rule was both rational and necessary: the American government has a responsibility to prioritize, first and foremost, the well-being of taxpaying citizens. That is the first duty of any regime.
The American economic situation has grown much more dire since then. We are in the middle of a national pandemic, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet, and there is a burgeoning crisis at the border. Under conditions like these, this is perhaps the worst imaginable time to gut this important safeguard. By creating a fresh incentive for foreign migrants to surge across our southern border, your actions reflect a profound misunderstanding of the plight of American workers and communities across the country, and threaten to further exacerbate an already severe humanitarian disaster.
This dangerous moment is no time for the Department to change course. The public charge rule serves the essential purpose of protecting Americans’ welfare first and foremost, and it should be immediately reinstated.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Reintroduce Protect and Serve Act to Punish Criminals for Targeting Law Enforcement
Date: Tuesday, March 16, 2021

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and 16 of his colleagues reintroduced the
Protect and Serve Act, legislation that would create federal penalties for individuals who deliberately target local, state, or federal law enforcement officers with violence.
In 2020, more than 300 officers were shot in the line of duty and 47 officers were shot and killed, including North Carolina officers Ryan Hendrix, Tyler Herndon, and Jason Shuping. Additionally, more than
300 officers
lost their lives to COVID-19.
In 2021, 14 officers have been killed by others in the line of duty, including Capitol Hill Police Officer
Brian David Sicknick
who was killed as a result of the attack against the U.S. Capitol.
Senator Hawley said,
“Rising crime rates and months of riots in cities across the country have put America’s police force in danger not seen for decades. In Missouri, David Dorn, a retired police officer, was murdered by rioters while defending a friend’s store. Those who seek to harm or kill the brave men and women of law enforcement must face justice and I’m proud to work with my colleagues to ensure they do.”
“Law enforcement officers in North Carolina and across the country are heroes who swear an oath to protect our communities, yet we are seeing an unacceptable rise in targeted attacks against the men and women in blue,”
said Senator Tillis.
“Those who commit senseless acts of violence against LEOs must be held accountable for their actions, which is why I am proud to reintroduce this legislation that creates federal penalties for criminals who target law enforcement. They put their lives on the line to protect us, and we should do the work in Congress to protect them.”
Introduced by U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the legislation is also co-sponsored by Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Thune (R-S.D.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).
The
Protect and Serve Act
would support law enforcement officers by:
Making it a federal crime to knowingly cause, or attempt to cause, serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer. Offenders are subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years.
An offender could receive a life sentence if a death results from the offense, or the offense includes kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, or attempted murder.
This law would apply to federal law enforcement officers and would also apply to state and local officers in circumstances where the federal government can establish jurisdiction over the case.
The
Protect and Serve Act
has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of Police Organizations, Sergeants Benevolent Association of the NYPD, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Sheriffs Association, and the Major County Sheriffs Association.

Title: Hawley, Smith Reintroduce U.S. Military Right to Carry Act
Date: Friday, March 12, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Congressman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) reintroduced legislation in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to ease the burden active duty military servicemembers face when renewing concealed-carry licenses while stationed outside of their state of residency. The U.S. Military Right to Carry Act allows servicemembers to renew their permits by mail and requires states to treat members of the military equally to state residents in issuing concealed carry permits.
“There is no reason the brave men and women who put their lives on the line for this country should have to fight through endless bureaucratic hurdles and red tape to maintain their concealed carry licenses. I’m proud to stand with my colleagues on behalf of our military service members and their Second Amendment rights.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“The men and women who served this country in the United States Military have earned the right to not face discrimination when it comes to their concealed carry permits,”
said Rep. Jason Smith. “If a member of the U.S. Armed Forces holds a concealed carry permit, they should be able to renew that permit by mail or be treated as a resident of the state in which they are stationed. I’m proud to work with Senator Hawley to ensure the constitutional rights of our military members are protected regardless of where they’re stationed, allowing them to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Background
Active duty servicemembers on orders outside of their home states often face difficulties maintaining their concealed-carry licenses or obtaining them because of in-person or state-resident-only requirements. Many states require concealed-carry license renewals through in-person appointments, creating bureaucratic barriers for military personnel who may be stationed elsewhere. Additionally, states often require residency in the state to permit concealed-carry licenses, so servicemembers who regularly move around to different duty stations may have difficulty obtaining concealed-carry weapon licenses.
The U.S. Military Right to Carry Act
Provides active duty servicemembers the option to renew concealed-carry weapon licenses by mail in their state of residency;
Requires state governments to implement a law to consider active duty servicemembers as residents of the state for purposes of issuing a permit to carry a concealed firearm in that state; and
Reduces a state’s federal grant funding if it refuses to offer military members these options for concealed carry licenses.

Title: Hawley Calls for Emergency Senate Hearing on Biden Administration’s Handling of Southern Border Crisis
Date: Wednesday, March 10, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent letters to President Joe Biden and Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, calling for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to testify at a full Senate hearing, to be scheduled as soon as possible on the growing crisis at the southern border.
Senator Hawley called on Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to explain the Biden administration’s
continued public denials
of the crisis and to clarify the details of their planned response.
“There is a crisis on the southern border. It is in fact a full-blown emergency,”
wrote Senator Hawley. “I believe that border security is national security. If we fail to demonstrate to the American public that we are operating a controlled, fair, and orderly immigration system, then it erodes public trust in our institutions and the laws passed by Congress. And this is not just about the border, scaling back immigration enforcement can have a major impact on both the safety of American communities and the livelihood of American workers across our nation.”

March 10, 2021
President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear President Biden:
There is a crisis on the southern border. It is in fact a full-blown emergency. Illegal border crossings have accelerated in recent months, a trend that is correlated with several recent policy changes by your administration, and news reports suggest that the situation at the border continues to worsen. To help improve transparency about your plans to secure the border, I urge you to immediately send Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to Congress to publicly testify to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
Congress, not the President, makes immigration law. And while every administration has the right to pursue policy changes within the parameters set out in statute, when those changes result in elevated levels of unrestricted, illegal border crossings, then it’s critical that the administration provide an explanation to Congress and to the American people. Unfortunately, so far, your administration refuses to accept reality and admit we are in a full-blown crisis. Yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that “I don’t think we need to sit here and put new labels on what we have already conveyed is challenging,” and said in response to a question about the number of children detained in federal facilities along the border that “it’s not our program.” [
1
] You have also avoided answering questions by the press as they relate to our southern border. [
2
] It is my hope that Secretary Mayorkas’ testimony will help to clarify the scale of the emergency and also provide confidence that as President you will do what is necessary to secure our nation’s borders.
I believe that border security is national security. If we fail to demonstrate to the American public that we are operating a controlled, fair, and orderly immigration system, then it erodes public trust in our institutions and the laws passed by Congress. And this is not just about the border, scaling back immigration enforcement can have a major impact on both the safety of American communities and the livelihood of American workers across our nation.
Thank you for your attention to this matter of great urgency.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Chairman
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs

Dear Chairman Peters:
I write to request that you schedule a full committee hearing as soon as practicable on the growing emergency at the southern border. It is critical that the committee conduct oversight into recent actions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and I ask that you use your authority as Chairman to call Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to publicly testify. Today, I am also sending a letter to President Biden urging him to dispatch Secretary Mayorkas to Congress as soon as possible.
Recently, there has been a surge of illegal migration on the southern border. [
1
] This new crisis follows a series of actions by the Biden administration, such as steps to reverse the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols, [
2
] an attempt to halt deportations, [
3
] a suspension of border wall construction, [
4
] and support for amnesty legislation. [
5
] As members of the relevant congressional oversight committee, it’s incumbent upon us to fully and publicly examine these recent changes and evaluate their impact on the “pull factors” that impact migration patterns and encourage illegal immigration into our country.
In addition, it’s not clear that Secretary Mayorkas is providing a full account of the emergency at our southern border to the American public. On March 1st, when asked if there was a crisis on the southern border, Secretary Mayorkas responded “no.” [
6
] However, this past Monday, in an email to staff, the Secretary reportedly conceded that there are “overwhelming numbers of migrants seeking access to this country along the Southwest Border.” [
7
] If Secretary Mayorkas thinks this is a crisis, then he should be honest with the American people and say so.
While every administration has the right to pursue policy changes, when those changes result in elevated levels of unrestricted, illegal border crossings, then rigorous oversight must be conducted. Such policy changes can have a major impact on both the safety of American communities and the livelihood of American workers. For these reasons, it’s critical that we maintain vigorous security and enforcement measures on our southern border.
Thank you for your consideration of this request. I look forward to working with you this Congress on issues related to border security.

Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Bill Imposing Sanctions on Drug Cartels
Date: Tuesday, March 09, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) introduced the
Significant Transnational Criminal Organization Designation Act, legislation that would subject certain foreign criminal organizations like drug cartels to sanctions, including immigration, financial, and criminal penalties. The process would be similar to the system used for designating entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“America has a duty to keep its citizens safe from brutal cartel violence. This bill gives law enforcement a critical new tool to ensure that cross-border criminals cannot terrorize our citizens.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“Criminal organizations and drug cartels that terrorize our communities and wage war at our borders ought to be treated just like terrorist groups in the eyes of the U.S. government. This bill would help stop cartel violence by ensuring these groups-and anyone who helps them-face dire consequences for their actions,”
said Senator Cotton.
“Criminal organizations like MS-13 terrorize American communities through human tracking and by smuggling drugs across our southern border. This legislation will make it easier for federal officials to crack down on these transnational criminal groups,”
said Senator Blackburn.
“Drug cartels along our southern border have been a problem for far too long. We need a way to keep these thugs in check, and this legislation would allow our federal law enforcement to do just that. These cartels are murderous organizations that have blurred the line between drug trafficking and terrorism, and this designation would allow us to label them for what they are,”
said Senator Sasse.
“Mexican cartels wreak havoc on our border and pose a direct threat to our national security. It’s past time we give the federal government every tool it needs to go after these thugs. From crippling sanctions to visa restrictions, this bill equips the administration to ensure these criminal organizations face severe consequences for their illicit activities,”
said Representative Gallagher.
Background
The Significant Transnational Criminal Organization Designation Act enables the federal government to impose on the most significant Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) the same sanctions that apply to FTOs including:
Barring organization members and their immediate families from admission to the United States.
Freezing assets.
Seeking civil and criminal penalties against Individuals providing material assistance or resources to the organization.

Title: Hawley Announces Legislation To Require $15 Minimum Wage for Billion-Dollar Corporations
Date: Friday, February 26, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced a plan to require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour. Senator Hawley’s plan would result in an immediate wage increase for millions of workers while avoiding a one-size-fits-all increase that would disadvantage small businesses.
Small business employees earning less than $15 per hour would benefit from Sen. Hawley’s recently introduced
Blue Collar Bonus, which would provide a bonus to every worker making below the median wage directly through an automatic, advanceable tax credit tied to hours worked.
“For decades, the wages of everyday, working Americans have remained stagnant while monopoly corporations have consolidated industry after industry, securing record profits for CEOs and investment bankers. Mega-corporations can afford to pay their workers $15 an hour, and it’s long past time they do so, but this should not come at the expense of small businesses already struggling to make it.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley’s plan would require the minimum wage for billion-dollar corporations be indexed to the federal median wage after 2025.

Title: Senator Hawley Announces Blue-Collar Bonus: A Pay Raise for American Workers
Date: Wednesday, February 24, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will introduce new legislation to give blue-collar workers a pay raise. For nearly four decades, workers making below the median wage have experienced stagnant wages, and this past year, the problem has been made worse by unprecedented layoffs, reduced hours, and income disruptions due to the government shutting down the economy over the coronavirus pandemic.
Senator Hawley believes higher wages for blue-collar workers are long overdue and that’s why he wants to provide a bonus to every worker making below the median wage.
Workers would receive the bonus directly through an automatic, advanceable tax credit tied to hours worked. Unlike other proposals to raise wages, this plan does not place a major new burden on small businesses, many of which are still recovering from harmful shutdowns.
Senator Hawley said, “Wages for blue-collar workers have been stagnant for decades. And government made the problem worse by shutting down the economy a year ago. It’s time we give blue-collar workers some respect and a pay raise. This plan would deliver meaningful relief for families and working Americans through higher pay while incentivizing and promoting work.”
The Blue-Collar Bonus Tax Credit
Credit Amount
The credit is worth 50 percent of the difference between the median wage and the worker’s hourly wage rate. In other words, the credit would boost per hour wages 50 percent closer to the median. The median wage is set at $16.50 per hour and will be indexed to inflation. The credit is allowed for a maximum of 40 hours per week and phases out at the median wage.
Example:
An American worker making $12 per hour would be eligible for a $2.25 per hour credit [(16.50-12.00)/2]. The maximum credit would be for 40 hours of work per week, or 2080 hours over the course of a year, allowing this full-time worker a total credit of $4,680 for the taxable year. This worker can expect to receive four distinct payments of $1,170 from the IRS.
Eligibility
American workers who hold a valid social security number and earn below the median wage as calculated on an hourly basis.
Delivery
The existing quarterly employer payroll tax reporting regime would be updated to include wage levels and hours worked for each worker who earns below the median wage. Following the submission of each tranche of quarterly wage data from employers, the IRS would send an advanceable “Blue-Collar Bonus Credit” to the eligible worker in the same payment manner by which they currently receive their tax refund, including direct deposit. Each eligible individual would receive four payments a year based on the hours they work.

Title: Hawley, Members of Missouri Delegation Ask for Review of Natural Gas Supply
Date: Thursday, February 18, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and members of the Missouri Congressional Delegation
sent a letter
to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) asking for a review of the natural gas supply in light of electricity outages, rolling blackouts, and controlled service interruptions across Missouri and the Midwest during extreme winter weather.
“Due to the surge in energy demand across the state, residents have been experiencing electricity outages, rolling blackouts, and controlled service interruptions during an incredibly precarious time as temperatures continue to drop,”
the lawmakers write. “We respectfully request FERC to expeditiously review the circumstances of this situation as it relates to natural gas supplies, the rates of interstate transmission of natural gas, and take the necessary steps needed to address this crisis.”
“In light of these challenges, we need to ensure there is an adequate supply of affordable energy and natural gas for families, farmers, and businesses in Missouri and the Midwest.”
The letter was also signed by Senator Roy Blunt, and Representatives Emanuel Cleaver, II, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Jason Smith, Sam Graves, Vicky Hartzler, Ann Wagner, and Billy Long.

February 18, 2021
The Honorable Richard Glick
Chairman
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, NE
Washington, D.C. 20426
Dear Chairman Glick,
On behalf of our constituents, including residents, farmers, and businesses in Missouri, we write today to raise a dire situation relating to natural gas shortages in Missouri and across the Midwest as the increase in energy demand continues to strain the electric grid. We wanted to make certain that you and your fellow Commissioners are aware of the concern in an effort to ensure there is a continued supply of affordable natural gas in Midwest states.
Due to the surge in energy demand across the state, residents have been experiencing electricity outages, rolling blackouts, and controlled service interruptions during an incredibly precarious time as temperatures continue to drop. Our offices have also received information suggesting that limited supplies of natural gas are also exacerbating the situation and are forcing utility providers to find alternative sources of energy during this time of emergency in an effort to provide reliable sources of power to residents and customers to heat their homes and keep businesses from operating or manufacturing.
We appreciate the initial steps that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) have taken to date in opening a joint inquiry on the impacts of severe winter weather on grid operations. We respectfully request FERC to expeditiously review the circumstances of this situation as it relates to natural gas supplies, the rates of interstate transmission of natural gas, and take the necessary steps needed to address this crisis. In light of these challenges, we need to ensure there is an adequate supply of affordable energy and natural gas for families, farmers, and businesses in Missouri and the Midwest. We look forward to working with you and stand ready to assist in any way possible.
Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.
Sincere regards,
Josh Hawley, United States Senator

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement on the passing of Rush Limbaugh:
Senator Hawley said,
“A proud son of Missouri, Rush Limbaugh was a voice for the voiceless. He changed talk radio, but more importantly, Rush changed the conversation to speak up for the forgotten, and challenge the establishment. He lived the First Amendment and told hard truths that made the elite uncomfortable, but made sure working men and women had a seat at the table. Erin and I are praying for the Limbaugh family.”

Title: Hawley, Scott Bill to Crack Down on WHO’s Coronavirus Lies, Inaction
Date: Wednesday, February 10, 2021

Content:
Yesterday, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced the
World Health Organization (WHO) Accountability Act
to hold the WHO responsible for its role in assisting China’s cover up of the origins and early spread of the coronavirus. The WHO Accountability Act withholds U.S. taxpayer dollars from the WHO until the organization replaces its leadership, as of January 1, 2020, and accepts Taiwan as a member state. It also limits U.S. funding to the same or less than the top contributor nation to the WHO each year.
“Time and again, the World Health Organization has prioritized advancing the Chinese Communist Party’s interests over building a healthier world. Dr. Tedros and other WHO leaders must be held accountable for this dereliction of duty, and the WHO must undertake comprehensive reform before it is allowed to benefit from U.S. tax dollars once again.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Rick Scott said, “The mission of the WHO is to get public health information to the world so every country can make the best decisions to keep their citizens safe. The WHO not only failed its mission, but it failed the world when it comes to the coronavirus. They served as a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party – parroting misinformation and helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic. Last February, I called on the WHO to do its own in-depth analysis on the extent and origins of the coronavirus. It took them nearly a year to take action and we still have no answer. They have even dropped their investigation into whether COVID-19 leaked from Wuhan lab. Their inaction has grave consequences.
“The WHO also needs to answer for its refusal to include Taiwan in its membership, meetings, and information, especially in the face of the coronavirus. They are complicit in Communist China’s effort to isolate Taiwan. There is no reason U.S. taxpayers should be spending hundreds of millions a year, more than any other country, to fund the WHO without significant reform. I’m proud to introduce the WHO Accountability Act to withhold American taxpayer dollars from the WHO until they start actually caring about public health, stop acting like a puppet for the Communist China and allow Taiwan as a member.”

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Demand Answers on Dangerous Biden DHS Deportation Moratorium
Date: Thursday, February 04, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and eleven Senate colleagues pushed back on a deportation moratorium proposed by President Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which will prevent the removal of the vast majority of illegal immigrants with final orders of removal–including dangerous criminals–from the United States.
The moratorium was proposed in a January 21 memorandum issued by DHS, purportedly to focus resources on border security and conduct immigration and asylum processing at the southern border. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforcement and removal officers, whose operations would be severely impacted by the January 21 memorandum, aren’t trained to handle either of those duties normally handled by completely different DHS component agencies. The deportation moratorium has been temporarily enjoined by a federal district court in Texas, but is poised for implementation if that injunction is lifted.
“Those seemingly harmless words mask what this memorandum actually does: it turns our nation of laws into a nation of loopholes. It is an insult to the men and women of DHS who have sworn to uphold those laws,” the senators wrote of the proposal. “…The Department’s January 21 memorandum creates, in our view, an unacceptable threat to public safety; constitutes a disregard for the rule of law and the will of Congress; and undercuts the integrity of the immigration enforcement regime.”
In a letter to newly-confirmed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Acting ICE Director Tae Johnson, the senators raise serious rule of law and public safety concerns. The senators also press the officials to provide information about the number of criminal illegal immigrants currently subject to removal, and whether all illegal immigrants currently subject to removal and charged with or convicted of homicide, sex crimes, robbery, kidnapping or domestic violence would still be eligible for removal under the proposed moratorium.
The letter is also signed by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.).
Full text of the letter follows or can be found
here
or below.
February 3, 2021
The Honorable Alejandro N. Mayorkas
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C. 20528
The Honorable Tae D. Johnson
Acting Director
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
Washington, DC 20536
Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Acting Director Johnson:
We write to express profound concern regarding the memorandum issued on January 21, 2021, entitled “Review of and Interim Revision to Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Policies and Priorities.” The memorandum directs Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components to “conduct a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement,” sets interim policies during the course of that review, and establishes a 100-day moratorium on most deportations “to enable focusing the Department’s resources where they are most needed.” Those seemingly harmless words mask what this memorandum actually does: it turns our nation of laws into a nation of loopholes. It is an insult to the men and women of DHS who have sworn to uphold those laws.
With respect to the 100-day deportation moratorium, we noted with alarm that there is no general exception to the moratorium for criminal aliens. Under the terms of the memorandum, unless the ICE Director determines that the law requires a specific criminal alien be removed, most criminal aliens with final removal orders will be untouchable as long as the deportation moratorium is in place. Given that 92% of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations’ (ERO) interior removals from the United States in FY2020 had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges the failure to exempt all criminal aliens from the deportation moratorium seems particularly egregious.
In 2016, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the recidivism rate of released criminal aliens was 35%. In addition, what message does this send to their victims–both past and future? It should also be noted that ICE is unable to execute a final order of removal unless that order is administratively final–that is, the individual has already availed himself of all due process and been ordered removed by an immigration judge or other Congressionally-established lawful process. Ordering ICE officers to ignore a judge’s order is an untenable situation and will most certainly undercut the public’s trust in law enforcement at a time when keeping that trust is critical. It will likely lead to another scandal for the agency, similar to that which happened in 2013, when thousands of criminal aliens were released from custody.
This deportation moratorium constitutes a wholescale abandonment of law enforcement and a frustration of the will of Congress, written into the law, that aliens with final removal orders actually be removed from the country. It also does not signal the sort of respect for the rule of law that Secretary Mayorkas professed repeatedly at his confirmation hearing on January 19.
According to the memorandum, the reason for the deportation moratorium is to prioritize “DHS’s limited resources” to: “(1) provide sufficient staff and resources to enhance border security and conduct immigration and asylum processing at the southwest border fairly and efficiently; and (2) comply with COVID-19 protocols to protect the health and safety of DHS personnel and those members of the public with whom DHS personnel interact.”
With respect to the first point, ICE enforcement and removal officers are not trained to conduct immigration and asylum processing functions normally carried out by USCIS or CBP officers, or to perform border security functions carried out by CBP officers. We also note that none of these duties are ones for which ICE is appropriated funds. In fact, this memorandum directs them to stop the vast majority of functions for which they are actually appropriated funds. We have seen this in the past, when ICE’s priorities were so narrow in Fiscal Year 2015 that it reprogrammed more than $110 million out of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. There is no excuse for that when ICE manages a docket of more than 2 million aliens and all those with final orders of removal haven’t been removed from our country. We’re a nation of laws. Congress appropriated that money and expected it to be used for the purpose it was appropriated.
We are also concerned that the 100-day deportation moratorium could cause a surge of releases of aliens, including many criminals, from ICE detention. In the case of Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the Supreme Court held that an alien in ICE detention generally could not be held longer than 6 months if their removal is unlikely to take place in the “reasonably foreseeable future.”
The Department’s January 21 memorandum creates, in our view, an unacceptable threat to public safety; constitutes a disregard for the rule of law and the will of Congress; and undercuts the integrity of the immigration enforcement regime. While some local jurisdictions have in recent years taken steps to establish themselves as “sanctuary cities,” at grave peril to their residents, the interim enforcement priorities and the deportation moratorium described in the January 21 memorandum are a big step towards converting the entire United States into a sanctuary nation. This is illogical and unacceptable.
While we are aware this dangerous policy has been temporarily enjoined by a federal district court in the Southern District of Texas, we remain concerned about its implementation in the event that injunction is lifted, as well as the impact its implementation could have on immigration enforcement in the months ahead. Therefore, we ask that you respond to the following questions by February 17, 2021. If you have any questions, please contact Drew Robinson on Senator Grassley’s Senate Judiciary Committee staff at 202-224-5225. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Please provide a numerical breakdown of all individuals with a final order of removal in ICE’s detained population according to their criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. Please use the same format found in Table 1 on pp. 15-16 of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Fiscal Year 2020 Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.
Please provide a numerical breakdown of all individuals with a final order of removal on ICE’s non-detained docket according to their criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. Please use the same format found in Table 1 on pp. 15-16 of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Fiscal Year 2020 Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for homicide continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for sexual assault continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for a sex offense continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for robbery or burglary continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for kidnapping continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
Will all criminal aliens with a final order of removal who have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charge for domestic violence continue to be eligible for deportation if the 100-day deportation moratorium is ultimately implemented according to the January 21 memorandum?
According to the January 21 memorandum, the 100-day deportation moratorium is being put in place in part to “provide sufficient staff and resources to enhance border security and conduct immigration and asylum processing at the southwest border fairly and efficiently.” Accordingly, please answer the following questions:
Given that ICE enforcement and removal officers are not trained to conduct immigration and asylum processing functions, to what specific functions will they be reassigned in order to “enhance border security and conduct immigration and asylum processing at the southwest border fairly and efficiently?”
If DHS is ultimately able to implement the 100-day deportation moratorium as called for in the January 21 memorandum, does the Department intend to continue redeployment of ICE enforcement and removal personnel to the southwest border beyond the 100-day deportation moratorium period?
Given the ongoing need for staff and resources at the southwest border on a continuous basis, does DHS anticipate extending the deportation moratorium beyond 100 days once implemented?
With DHS advocating for removals to be suspended altogether for 100 days–and with removal policy uncertain after that–how do DHS and ICE plan to defend against habeas petitions filed by criminal aliens under Zadvydas v. Davis arguing that, in light of the long-term uncertainty in the U.S. government’s removal policy, there is no “significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future”?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Calls to Restrict Federal Funds from Schools Refusing to Reopen
Date: Wednesday, February 03, 2021

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced an amendment to Congress’s proposed budget resolution that would restrict federal relief funds from schools that are refusing to reopen. Recent studies
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) found schools operating in-person have seen negligible spread of the coronavirus yet many schools across the country refuse to reopen, to detriment of parents and children.
“In spite of overwhelming evidence that schools can reopen safely, partisan advocates are using children’s education as a cudgel to push their radical agendas. The effect on children and working-class families has been absolutely devastating. The federal government should put an end to this two-tiered education system for the haves and the have-nots by incentivizing schools to safely reopen.”

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) blasted big banks and hedge funds over their role in freezing out day traders and small investors from trading Robinhood stock. Senator Hawley said Wall Street has deemed itself too big to fail but is rigging the system against anyone else.
“What we’ve seen I think with this GameStop meltdown that Wall Street is having now, these folks at home, these day traders, retail investors, they’ve got more criticism, more scrutiny than the people who crashed the entire financial market in 2008 and they got bailed out, the government bailed out all of those people. I mean it shows you that the fix is in.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“Too big to fail, exactly right, and now the big hedge funds, they don’t want any competition. They’re fine if these day traders do as they’re told, you know, do what they’re supposed to do but when they get ideas of their own and they bet against Wall Street, well, my gosh, then they’re a threat, then they need to be shut down. I just think this shows you that just like we’ve got this concentration of power in so many industries, the tech companies, on Wall Street too the big banks, the big hedge funds. They don’t want the competition. They want to be in control.”

Dear Mr. Merlo,
I am writing regarding your company’s role in administering COVID-19 vaccines to the people of Missouri.
As a primary participant in the federal government’s Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, your company has agreed to vaccinate residents and employees in Missouri’s long-term care facilities. The objective of this public-private partnership was to leverage the scale and logistical know-how of your company to safely and efficiently inoculate the state’s highest-risk populations. Unfortunately, reports out of Missouri suggest that the pace of inoculations has fallen short of expectations, and that your company might be holding an excess supply of vaccine doses. On January 26, 2021, the Missouri government indicated that the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program had only administered 17 percent of the 332,000 doses that the state had allocated to it.

Title: Senator Hawley Reintroduces Duck Boat Safety Legislation
Date: Thursday, January 28, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
reintroduced
his legislation to improve the safety of duck boats following the 2018 tragedy on Table Rock Lake. Senator Hawley’s legislation, cosponsored by Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), would authorize previously-outlined National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations, including commonsense provisions to require the use of life jackets and equipping all operating duck boats to be more buoyant in the case of emergency flooding.
“In 2018, 17 people lost their lives in a preventable tragedy on Table Rock Lake. The best way we can honor the lives lost there and those lost in the accidents that preceded it is to do our part in protecting safety on the water and passing this common-sense legislation. This bill passed the Senate unanimously last year, and I am committed to building on that progress and seeing it become law.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“Seventeen people lost their lives in the duck boat tragedy on Table Rock Lake,”
said Senator Blunt. “These common-sense safety measures, which are long overdue and need to go into effect immediately, will help prevent an incident like this from ever happening again. I was disappointed the House didn’t act on this important legislation after it passed the Senate last Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to come together and support our efforts to improve safety and protect lives.”
Senator Hawley’s bill was
passed unanimously
by the full Senate and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in the 116th Congress.

Title: Hawley Calls for Investigation into Democrat Abuse of Senate Ethics Process
Date: Monday, January 25, 2021

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh (R-Mo.) is filing a
counter-complaint
today against seven Senate Democrats who called for an ethics investigation into his objection to certifying Pennsylvania’s electoral count. The Democrats admitted in their complaint that Hawley’s electoral college objection was lawful. In a letter to the seven Democrat Senators, Senator Hawley called out the senators for their historic partisan abuse of the Senate ethics process and potential coordination with dark money groups.
Senator Hawley wrote, “The idea that one Senator who disagrees with another Senator can therefore have that Senator punished, sanctioned, censured, or removed is utterly antithetical to our democracy and the very idea of open, lawful debate. This line of thinking is, however, sadly consistent with the new woke-mob mentality that you should cancel anyone who disagrees with your views. Your baseless allegations are in that sense unfortunately typical of today’s leftwing cancel culture, a culture that tramples on the democratic traditions that left and right once defended together.
“In light of the shameful abuse of the ethics process you have deliberately engaged in, I have considered whether I should call for you to resign or be expelled from the Senate. But I continue to believe in the First Amendment, which the US Supreme Court has repeatedly said protects even ‘offensive’ and malicious speech, such as yours.
“The First Amendment does not, however, give you carte blanche to abuse the Senate ethics process. I have today filed a complaint with the ethics committee that details your deliberate and partisan abuse of this process, including your apparent coordination with various dark money groups, and requests that you be appropriately disciplined.”

Dear Senators:
I was astounded to see the outrageous personal and partisan attack you labeled an “ethics complaint.” It is a startling abuse of the ethics process and a direct assault on democratic debate.
The idea that one Senator who disagrees with another Senator can therefore have that Senator punished, sanctioned, censured, or removed is utterly antithetical to our democracy and the very idea of open, lawful debate. This line of thinking is, however, sadly consistent with the new woke-mob mentality that you should cancel anyone who disagrees with your views. Your baseless allegations are in that sense unfortunately typical of today’s leftwing cancel culture, a culture that tramples on the democratic traditions that left and right once defended together.
Your insinuation that Senator Cruz and I, by representing our constituents in debate in a manner you acknowledge is lawful, following the precedent set by Democratic members of Congress over the last three decades, somehow bear responsibility for the criminal rioters at the Capitol is shamefully false. And you know it to be so.
You well know that multiple members of your own party have raised objections to the Electoral College results in 3 elections over the past 25 years, which is to say, every single time a Republican President has been elected. You of course did not call for the expulsion of any of these members, and for one reason: they are in the same political party as you are.
In light of the shameful abuse of the ethics process you have deliberately engaged in, I have considered whether I should call for you to resign or be expelled from the Senate. But I continue to believe in the First Amendment, which the US Supreme Court has repeatedly said protects even “offensive” and malicious speech, such as yours.
The First Amendment does not, however, give you carte blanche to abuse the Senate ethics process. I have today filed a complaint with the ethics committee that details your deliberate and partisan abuse of this process, including your apparent coordination with various dark money groups, and requests that you be appropriately disciplined.
In closing, please understand this: I will not be intimidated by your efforts to silence me, the people of my state will not be intimidated by you, and you should be ashamed to have so grossly abused your office and the Senate.

] Without citing any relevant evidence or offering any good-faith argument, they attempted to link my objection lodged under 3 U.S.C. § 15 to the criminal riot at the Capitol that occurred on January 6.  They submitted their meritless complaint in potential coordination with a campaign by partisan and dark-money groups that have peddled falsehoods about me and my objection.  By knowingly submitting a frivolous complaint to accomplish impermissible partisan purposes, these Senators have engaged in improper conduct that may reflect upon the Senate.  The Committee should discipline these Members to ensure that the Senate’s ethics process is not weaponized for rank partisan purposes.
The complaint against me does not suggest that my objection to Pennsylvania’s electoral votes was legally improper.  No Senator could make such a suggestion with a straight face.  Federal law expressly authorizes Senators to object that a State’s electoral votes were not “regularly given.”  3 U.S.C. § 15.  Democrats have repeatedly invoked this provision.  Indeed, in every presidential election since 2000 that a Republican has won, Democrats have sought to object to electoral votes on that ground, regardless of whether any good-faith basis existed for such objections.  Thus, my objection invoked a lawful process that has been used multiple times under comparable circumstances.
Moreover, there is a strong legal basis to believe that Pennsylvania’s electoral votes were not regularly given.  Indeed, it appears that Pennsylvania conducted the 2020 general election using a mail-voting scheme that violated the Commonwealth’s Constitution.  That’s not just my opinion: while no judge has concluded that the mail-voting system was valid, multiple members of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court expressed substantial doubt about the validity of the statute.  See Kelly v. Commonwealth, No. 68 MAP 2020, 2020 WL 7018314 (Pa. Nov. 28, 2020), at *5 & 5 n.3 (Saylor, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  My Democrat colleagues may disagree with my reading of Pennsylvania law—and, apparently, the intuitions of some of Pennsylvania’s most esteemed jurists—but it is clear that my objection rested on far more solid ground than the electoral college objections submitted by Democrat Members of Congress after the 2000, 2004, and 2016 elections.  Yet Democrats did not hasten to censure or expel their objecting colleagues; instead, they offered paeans to them.  The only difference is that I am a Republican.  This manifestly partisan exercise demeans this Committee and the critical purposes that it serves.
Most astonishingly, the Democrats who filed the complaint against me insinuate—without any evidence whatsoever—that I or my staff may have conspired with the criminals who stormed the Capitol.  In most jurisdictions, such statements would constitute defamation per se, and if offered during debate they would constitute a clear violation of Senate Rule XIX.2.  Fabricating conspiracy theories to attack me for political purposes is bad enough.  Offensively trying to tie me to Nazi antisemitism—as Senator Hirono did when she outrageously accused me of pushing “the Big Lie” [
2
]—is even worse.  Using this Committee to promote them demeans this body and diminishes the public’s trust in the seriousness of the Senate.
In sum, this complaint is none other than a transparent attempt by seven Senators to punish a political opponent for the entirely lawful representation of their constituents.  The Senate cannot function if its neutral administrative processes are hijacked for bad-faith ends, but that is precisely what is occurring here.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully request that the Committee investigate the conduct of Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, Smith, Blumenthal, Hirono, Kaine, and Brown in preparing and filing this baseless and destructive complaint. In particular, I urge the Committee to pursue the following questions:
In preparing their complaint, what contacts did Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, Smith, Blumenthal, Hirono, Kaine, and Brown have with the Lincoln Project, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, MoveOn, Voto Latino, the Sierra Club, or any other outside organization?
In preparing their complaint, what contacts did Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, Smith, Blumenthal, Hirono, Kaine, and Brown have with Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, White House officials, or other Democratic leadership?
Have Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, Smith, Blumenthal, Hirono, Kaine, and Brown, or their affiliates, been contacting lobbyists for corporations urging the suspension of those corporations’ political contributions?
Following the conclusion of this investigation, I request that the Committee take all disciplinary action that it deems appropriate.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Stefanik to Reintroduce Resolution to Investigate Origins of COVID-19, Hold CCP Accountable Amid Biden Decision to Rejoin WHO
Date: Friday, January 22, 2021

Content:
Following an announcement from the Biden administration that the
U.S. would be rejoining the World Health Organization
(WHO), U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) announced plans to reintroduce their resolution calling for an international investigation into the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) cover-up of the COVID-19 outbreak. The WHO has
allowed Beijing to dictate the terms of the investigation
and
stated their intention
is “not about finding China guilty.”
Originally introduced in March 2020, Senator Hawley’s resolution also calls on Beijing to make restitution to all those nations who have suffered on account of its lies. U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) introduced companion legislation in the House.
“It has been one year since the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. and China continues to stonewall any credible investigation into the origins of this deadly pandemic. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization, which President Biden has praised, has shown itself to be, at best, incompetent and, at worst, a pawn of the Chinese Communist Party. We must redouble our efforts to understand how CCP negligence unleashed a global pandemic and hold them accountable.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Congresswoman Stefanik said, “As the leader of the free world, President Joe Biden has the power to demand answers from the World Health Organization as to why they promoted Chinese misinformation about the global COVID-19 pandemic that ultimately led toprofound economic and human wreckage in hundreds of countries, including the loss of more than 400,000 American lives. Instead, President Biden made the illogical decision to rejoin the WHO without repercussions or demands for critical reforms. President Biden must stand up for the American people, and hold tax-payer funded, global organizations like the WHO responsible when America’s interests are being ignored.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement regarding calls from Senate Democrats for an ethics investigation into his objection to certifying Pennsylvania’s electoral votes:
“Joe Biden and the Democrats talk about unity but are brazenly trying to silence dissent. This latest effort is a flagrant abuse of the Senate ethics process and a flagrant attempt to exact partisan revenge. Democrats appear intent on weaponizing every tool at their disposal — including pushing an unconstitutional impeachment process — to further divide the country.

U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement after placing a hold on a procedural move to bypass full committee consideration of Alejandro N. Mayorkas to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security:
“On Day 1 of his administration, President-elect Biden has said he plans to unveil an amnesty plan for 11 million immigrants in this nation illegally. This comes at a time when millions of American citizens remain out of work and a new migrant caravan has been attempting to reach the United States. Mr. Mayorkas has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden’s promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures. Just today, he declined to say he would enforce the laws Congress has already passed to secure the border wall system. Given this, I cannot consent to skip the standard vetting process and fast-track this nomination when so many questions remain unanswered.”

Title: Hawley on Biden Nazi Comparison: Undignified, Immature, and Intemperate Behavior

U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement responding to President-elect Joe Biden’s comparison of him and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to a Nazi propagandist:
“President-elect Biden has just compared me and another Republican Senator to Nazis. You read that correctly. Think about that for a moment. Let it sink in. Because I raised questions in the format prescribed by the laws of the United States about the way elections were conducted in the state of Pennsylvania, just as Democrats did about other states in 2001, 2005, and 2017, he is calling me a Nazi. This is undignified, immature, and intemperate behavior from the President-elect. It is utterly shameful. He should act like a dignified adult and retract these sick comments. And every Democrat member of congress should be asked to disavow these disgusting comments.”

Title: Sen. Hawley Will Object During Electoral College Certification Process On Jan 6
Date: Wednesday, December 30, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will object during the Electoral College certification process on January 6, 2021. Senator Hawley will object to highlight the failure of some states, including notably Pennsylvania, to follow their own election laws as well as the unprecedented interference of Big Tech monopolies in the election. He will call for Congress to launch a full investigation of potential fraud and election irregularities and enact election integrity measures.
Democrats have previously objected during the certification process for the 2004 and 2016 Presidential elections.
Senator Hawley said, “Following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.
“I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws. And I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.
“For these reasons, I will follow the same practice Democrat members of Congress have in years past and object during the certification process on January 6 to raise these critical issues.”
Background On Previous Objections to Electoral College Vote Certification
In 2005, Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones Objected to the Electoral College Votes from Ohio.
Stephanie Tubs-Jones Said, “I Raise This Objection Because I Am Convinced That We As A Body Must Conduct A Formal And Legitimate Debate About Election Irregularities.”

Senator Hawley said, “So, the work that we’re going to do today—and I hope to see a vote on this floor yet today on this relief—it is a step, a step in the right direction, but it is only a step. And I hope that it will be the beginning, Mr. President, of a better approach. The beginning of actually putting working Americans first, putting their needs, putting their independence, putting their strength, their families, their communities first. That ought to be the economic policy of this nation. That ought to be the economic policy of this body. And I can assure you that is the foundation on which economic recovery will be built, because it’s the working people of this nation who powered the American economy.”

“It would be a dereliction of duty if Congress adjourns for Christmas without having a vote on providing working families with direct payments. Working people are struggling. And they should be the first people given relief, not last.

It’s time we do something about it and provide emergency relief to Americans.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Sanders said, “In the midst of this terrible pandemic and economic crisis, this amendment would make certain that working families get the urgent, direct support they need to survive.  A direct payment of $1,200 for adults and $500 for kids would help desperate families pay rent and heating bills, put food on the table, and be able to go to the doctor.  In the midst of so much economic desperation, Congress cannot go on recess without providing this $1,200 emergency assistance to the American people in their time of need.  I look forward to working across the aisle with Senator Hawley to ensure that the United States Senate passes this amendment.”

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Bipartisan Bill Empowering Victims of Porn Industry Exploitation to Sue Host Websites
Date: Wednesday, December 09, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Survivors of Human Trafficking Fight Back Act
to create a private cause of action allowing victims of rape and sex trafficking, as well as individuals whose intimate images are distributed without their consent, to sue pornographic websites that profit off their exploitation. Senator Hawley’s bill is cosponsored by Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).
“Sites like Pornhub routinely escape responsibility for facilitating abuse, trafficking, and exploitation, making millions for themselves in the process. Meanwhile, the victims of this abuse have little recourse against these powerful companies, who thrive on spreading depraved content. Serious criminal penalties are needed to crack down on these tech executives who think they are above the law.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hassan said,
“We shouldn’t have to pass a law to keep companies from profiting by sharing, without consent, intimate images. But we do. The harm that these companies cause is extraordinary, lasts a lifetime, and should be unthinkable. This bipartisan bill helps give more power to those whose privacy and dignity have been violated by making it easier to take down images that have been non-consensually shared, and providing recourse for individuals to hold companies accountable for their wrongdoing.”
Senator Ernst said,
“In recent years, we’ve seen an uptick in human trafficking through pornography. Host websites that allow perpetrators to disseminate photos and video of sexual assaults or coerced sex acts on their platforms are evading the law while profiting directly from trafficking. This bill will help empower victims of human trafficking to seek justice and put an end to the complex and heartbreaking cycle of exploitation.”
Senator Tillis said,
“Pornographic websites routinely post videos of woman who are the victims of abuse or exploitation, and it is past time these companies are held accountable for posting this disgusting content. I am proud to co-introduce this legislation with Senator Hawley that would allow the victims of these videos to sue pornographic websites for distributing and profiting from videos that are posted without consent.”
Background
The
Survivors of Human Trafficking Fight Back Act
would:
Criminalize the knowing distribution of visual depictions of forced or coerced sex acts.
Criminalize the knowing, nonconsensual distribution of depictions of sex acts (“revenge porn”), as well as privacy-invading “locker-room” images.
Require all websites hosting pornography to create notice and takedown procedures ensuring that victims of coerced or privacy-invading videos can promptly have their images removed from the internet.
Allow victims to sue websites that knowingly host depictions of forced sex acts or that distribute privacy-invading images and videos.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Trade Legislation to Protect American Jobs, Remove Special Treatment for Nations with Slave Labor
Date: Tuesday, December 08, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Trade Preference Reform and Worker Protection Act
to prioritize American workers by halting nonreciprocal trade benefits until the unemployment rate in the United States is below four percent. Senator Hawley’s bill will also prevent nations from receiving special trade benefits if they are suspected of exporting goods produced by slave labor.
“Trade programs should protect American workers and help their families to prosper, not benefit foreign nations or mega-corporations. Yet, for decades our trade policy has decimated millions of American jobs. It’s time to put workers at the center of our trade policy.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Background
In the
Trade Act of 1974, Congress authorized the creation of a trade preference program, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which offers tariff-free access to the American market on imports from designated developing nations, to help spur their economic development. In 2018, nearly $24 billion worth of imports arrived in the United States duty-free under this program, while American producers received no comparable trade benefit in return.
The
Trade Preference Reform and Worker Protection Act
would:
Extend trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences only if the unemployment rate in the United States is below four percent
Automatically suspend trade benefits under the GSP if the unemployment rate rises above four percent
Exclude any nation from receiving benefits that has been designated by the Department of Labor as suspected of exporting goods produced by forced labor or child labor

Title: Hawley Blasts McKinsey for Proposed Bounties on Opioid Overdoses
Date: Tuesday, December 01, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to McKinsey & Company Global Managing Partner, Kevin Sneader, blasting the company for their proposal to ensure sales of Purdue Pharma’s OxyContin by paying pharmacies bounties for opioid overdoses. Senator Hawley says that McKinsey may have committed federal crimes as a co-conspirator of Purdue and by possibly destroying evidence relevant to potential government investigations.
“McKinsey’s abhorrent conduct also demands that Congress consider broader action. McKinsey earns billions of dollars from contracts with the federal government. No firm that proposes paying kickbacks for overdose deaths should receive a single cent from U.S. taxpayers. In light of McKinsey’s possible active role in driving the opioid crisis, Congress must consider whether to impose obligations on consulting firms to report criminal activity or specific criminal penalties for consultants playing a role in federal crimes.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley requested that, by December 15, McKinsey state whether personnel discussed destroying evidence related to their work with Purdue, whether any evidence was in fact destroyed, and any disciplinary action taken against McKinsey personnel for their role in the project.
Senator Hawley
has previously called for
the federal government to provide additional resources to combat the overdose crisis in Missouri and, as Missouri Attorney General,
filed suit against opioid manufacturers
—including Purdue—for violating consumer protection laws.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
December 1, 2020
Mr. Kevin Sneader
Global Managing Partner
McKinsey & Company
3 World Trade Center
175 Greenwich Street
New York, New York 10007
Dear Mr. Sneader:
I read with disgust the recent New York Times article McKinsey Proposed Paying Pharmacy Companies Rebates for OxyContin Overdoses. The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans and destroyed countless families and communities. Fighting the scourge of opioid addiction and death has been among my top priorities as an elected official. As Missouri Attorney General, I sued the leading opioid manufacturers—including Purdue Pharma—for their role in creating and profiting from this crisis.
The Times reports that McKinsey recommended paying a $14,810 bounty to pharmacies for each opioid addiction or overdose (what your consultants called an “event”) to ensure that pharmacies would not stand in the way of Purdue’s quest to “turbocharge” its sales of the lethal drug.  The Times further reports that once McKinsey learned of government investigations into Purdue’s misconduct, two senior McKinsey consultants—Martin Elling and Arnab Ghatak—discussed destroying evidence of McKinsey’s consulting work in an effort to avoid government scrutiny.
If this reporting is accurate, McKinsey has engaged in startlingly unethical conduct.  Such conduct would also appear to constitute federal crimes.  From the recently filed settlement agreement between the Government and Purdue Pharma, there are serious questions about whether McKinsey is guilty of the federal crimes to which Purdue recently pled guilty, either as a co-conspirator or by aiding and abetting those crimes.  Moreover, allegations that Mr. Elling and Mr. Ghatak discussed destroying evidence relevant to pending government investigations raises the prospect that McKinsey may also have engaged in obstruction of justice.  These issues must be reviewed by the appropriate law enforcement authorities, and they also fall within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, of which I am the Chairman.
McKinsey’s abhorrent conduct also demands that Congress consider broader action. McKinsey earns billions of dollars from contracts with the federal government. No firm that proposes paying kickbacks for overdose deaths should receive a single cent from U.S. taxpayers.  In light of McKinsey’s possible active role in driving the opioid crisis, Congress must consider whether to impose obligations on consulting firms to report criminal activity or specific criminal penalties for consultants playing a role in federal crimes.  McKinsey’s apparent efforts to destroy evidence of its conduct suggests that Congress must impose additional recordkeeping and document-retention obligations on consulting firms to ensure that they do not facilitate illegal activity.
To aid Congress in assessing the need for immediate legislative action, please provide the following information on or before December 15, 2020.
State whether McKinsey personnel proposed paying rebates based on overdose deaths or the development of opioid use disorder, as alleged in the New York Times article.
State whether McKinsey personnel discussed destroying evidence relating to McKinsey’s consulting work for Purdue Pharma, as alleged in the New York Times article.  If so, produce all internal correspondence reflecting such discussions.
State whether McKinsey personnel in fact destroyed any evidence relating to McKinsey’s consulting work for Purdue Pharma.  If so, identify and describe all documents and other data that were destroyed.
Identify all McKinsey personnel involved in the firm’s consulting work for Purdue Pharma.
State the total amount of money that McKinsey earned from its consulting work for Purdue Pharma.
State the total amount of money that McKinsey earned from its consulting work with any firm, in the United States, China, or elsewhere, involved in the development, manufacture, distribution, or sale of opioids.

Title: Senator Hawley Continues to Press Facebook, Twitter for Answers on Coordinated Censorship, User Tracking
Date: Tuesday, November 24, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) submitted questions to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary record following their hearing last week. In his questions, Senator Hawley continues to press both CEOs on their companies practices of coordinated censorship and tracking of users all across the web.
Mr. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook)
How many entries in Facebook’s Tasks tool pertain to content moderation and reference contacts at Google?
How many entries in Facebook’s Tasks tool pertain to content moderation and reference contacts at Twitter?
How many entries in Facebook’s Tasks tool pertain to content moderation and reference contacts or information from the Southern Poverty Law Center?
Please provide a list of all hashtags, URLs, and real-world individuals that Facebook has banned across its platform, along with notations of whether the impetus for the ban stemmed from contacts with employees at Twitter, Google, or the Southern Poverty Law Center.
How many accounts in the United States has Facebook surveilled or shut down using the Centra tool?
When a Facebook employee accesses a Facebook user’s private messages, that access is allegedly tracked and audited. How many such audits were conducted by Facebook during fiscal year 2019?
A November 23 article in the Financial Times, entitled “Facebook plans charm offensive for Joe Biden” reported that “[c]ompany executives are planning a major push to encourage users to take a coronavirus vaccine, as well as incentivising people to share content related to the Paris climate agreement, which Joe Biden has promised to rejoin, in the hopes of winning favour in Washington.” Please describe all steps Facebook intends to take to encourage users to share content related to the Paris climate agreement.
Please explain how any advocacy by Facebook for rejoining the Paris climate agreement would be consistent with Facebook’s self-description as a “platform” and not a “publisher.”
Mr. Jack Dorsey (Twitter)
Does Twitter have a policy prohibiting its employees from coordinating content moderation decisions with outside companies such as Facebook or Google, where such moderation is not strictly required by law?
Please provide a list of all hashtags, URLs, and real-world individuals that Twitter has banned across its platform.

Title: Senator Hawley’s Bipartisan ‘Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act’ Passes Senate Commerce Committee
Date: Thursday, November 19, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bipartisan legislation to
improve the safety of duck boats
following the 2018 tragedy on Table Rock Lake passed the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation.
“For too long, Congress has failed to take action to help stop these tragedies like the one that killed so many at Table Rock Lake. With my bipartisan bill clearing the Commerce Committee today, we’re one step closer. This legislation is about enacting commonsense safety recommendations that the NTSB has been making for years, like requiring life jackets and better equipping duck boats in case of emergency flooding. I hope the Senate will take this bill up with the urgency it deserves.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“We must do everything we can to ensure an incident like the Duck Boat tragedy on Table Rock Lake, which claimed the lives of 17 victims and left their loved ones grieving their loss, never happens again,”
Senator Blunt said. “This bill requires commonsense safety measures that are long overdue and should be put into effect immediately. I was proud to partner with Senator Hawley on this bill and support it in the Commerce Committee. With the bill now ready for consideration by the full Senate, I urge all of our colleagues to support our effort to keep people safe.”
“The sinking of a duck boat in 2018 was a tragedy that should never happen again,”
Senator Cotton said. “Our bill will introduce new guidelines to help ensure that duck boat tours are a safe, reliable recreation activity for families around the country.”
“I’m pleased to see our bipartisan legislation reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee today,”
Senator Duckworth said. “We’ve already seen too many tragedies involving these vessels, and I’m glad that we’re finally one step closer to ensuring that necessary oversight and safety precautions are implemented to prevent unnecessary accidents in the future.”
Sen. Hawley’s
Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act
would authorize previously-outlined National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations, including commonsense provisions to require the use of life jackets and equipping all operating duck boats to be more buoyant in the case of emergency flooding.
Amendments were made to the bill during the committee process. Those amendments include requirements to log various safety actions, mandatory annual safety trainings for crew, and consideration of safety recommendations in previous incident reports. Other amendments would require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to provide a report to Congress regarding the status of implementation of the regulations and various technical changes.
The
bipartisan list of co-sponsors, to-date, includes Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).
Background
Amphibious Passenger Vehicles (APVs) are passenger vehicles viable on both land and on water. The most common APVs are amphibious tour buses or DUKWs (commonly referred to as “duck boats”). On July 19, 2018, 17 people died and 11 others were injured when a duck boat capsized on Table Rock Lake during a thunderstorm near Branson, Missouri, in one of the deadliest boating accidents in U.S. history.
This tragedy could have been avoided.
The Duck Boat Safety Enhancment Act
implements reasonable safety recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that would have prevented the tragedy on Table Rock Lake and will preserve both safety and fun for future duck boat riders. On Wednesday, Nov. 18, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation unanimously reported the bill as amended.
Amendments to the
Duck Boat Safety Enhancement Act
include:
Requirement to Log Actions
Operator of amphibious passenger vehicles must check and notate in the vessel’s logbook the National Weather Service forecast before getting underway and periodically while underway and log that they informed and visually checked that seatbelts are not worn during waterborne operations.
Mandatory Annual Training
Operators and crew of amphibious passenger vehicles must complete annual training in several areas, including personal flotation and seat belt requirements, verifying the integrity of the vessel, identifying water hazards, use of National Weather Services resources, and responding to emergency situations.
Consideration of Recommendations from Reports
In addition to the recommendations following the incident in Table Rock, Missouri, the bill requires the Coast Guard to address recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board and Coast Guard Marine Investigation Board reports on incidents in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and Seattle, Washington.
Reports and Technical Changes
The amended text incorporates several technical changes and a requirement that the Commandant of the Coast Guard provide a report to Congress regarding the status of implementation of the regulations.

Title: Hawley Praises President Trump’s Plan to Bring Troops Home from Afghanistan
Date: Tuesday, November 17, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO.)
sent a letter
to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller expressing his support for President Trump’s plan to promptly withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. Senator Hawley writes that the original U.S. counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan has given way to nation-building, the costs of which are borne overwhelmingly by working Americans.
“For these reasons, majorities of Americans, including veterans of the war itself, have long called for an end to the war in Afghanistan. Yet most of our nation’s policymakers have ignored them. They are certainly entitled to keep advocating nation-building, but they have no right to force working Americans to pay the price for their agenda. The American people deserve an end to this war. They deserve to know their sons and daughters will not be put in harm’s way unless it is absolutely necessary. And they deserve to see their tax dollars actually being used to defend them – from Chinese domination, above all – or reinvested at home, in their families and communities.”

November 17, 2020
The Honorable Christopher Miller
Acting Secretary of Defense
1000 Defense Pentagon
Washington, DC 20301
Dear Acting Secretary Miller,
I write to express my support for President Trump’s plan for the prompt withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.
As President Trump has noted, and as you know better than most, Americans have been fighting in Afghanistan for more than 19 years. That makes the war in Afghanistan the longest war in our nation’s history. Sons and daughters are now patrolling their parents’ old routes, and many of the U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan were not even born when the 9/11 attacks occurred.
There was a time for war in Afghanistan, and there were very compelling reasons. In the aftermath of 9/11, it was imperative that we destroyed al Qaeda and punished the Taliban. But those objectives have long since given way to a broader nation-building mission in the region. This is a mistake. We have built a worldwide counterterrorism enterprise that allows us to disrupt, degrade, and destroy terrorist organizations far more effectively than ever before. So long as we stay focused on our counterterrorism objectives, maintain our ability to identify and strike targets as needed, and coordinate our withdrawal appropriately, we can prevent groups in Afghanistan from launching attacks on the United States without keeping thousands of American troops on the ground.
Meanwhile, the costs of the war in Afghanistan continue to mount, and they are borne disproportionately by working Americans. It is overwhelmingly their sons and daughters who are sent into harm’s way and make the ultimate sacrifice. It is their families and communities that have been hurt most as policymakers in Washington sent hundreds of billions – if not trillions – of their hard-earned tax dollars to Afghanistan, instead of investing that money here at home. And it is they who will suffer most if we keep investing in Afghanistan at the expense of our ability to deal with other adversaries, especially China, which seeks to dominate the world – including the United States – and is rapidly building a military to do just that.
For these reasons, majorities of Americans, including veterans of the war itself, have long called for an end to the war in Afghanistan. Yet most of our nation’s policymakers have ignored them. They are certainly entitled to keep advocating nation-building, but they have no right to force working Americans to pay the price for their agenda. The American people deserve an end to this war. They deserve to know their sons and daughters will not be put in harm’s way unless it is absolutely necessary. And they deserve to see their tax dollars actually being used to defend them – from Chinese domination, above all – or reinvested at home, in their families and communities.
You wrote recently, “All wars must end.” Acting Secretary Miller, the time has come to end the war in Afghanistan. I urge you to stand with President Trump and bring our troops home as expeditiously as possible.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley Reveals Existence of Coordination Tool Used By Big Tech Firms to Censor Users & Facebook Tool to Covertly Track Users Across Internet
Date: Tuesday, November 17, 2020

Content:
In a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing today with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
revealed an internal tool
used by Facebook, Google and Twitter to coordinate the censorship of users. Senator Hawley also revealed an internal tool used by Facebook to track the actions of users across the internet that was previously believed to be private. The use of the internal tools was disclosed to Senator Hawley by a whistleblower from Facebook.
At the hearing, Senator Hawley outlined the use of Tasks, a tool Facebook uses to improve the workflow of Facebook employees, but is also used by Facebook employees to collaborate with Google and Twitter in censoring users across platforms, and a second tool called Centra that Facebook uses to track users even when they think they are anonymous.
Senator Hawley questioned the CEOs on whether Facebook used the Tasks platform to coordinate in their censorship of users. Senator Hawley also questioned Zuckerberg on how many accounts in the U.S. have been subject to a shutdown through Centra, whether Facebook makes a record of instances in which employees access users’ private data without their consent, and whether doing so triggers an audit.

Title: Hawley Introduces Bill to Ban Ballot Harvesting, Protect Election Integrity
Date: Tuesday, November 10, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced a new bill
to ban ballot harvesting in federal elections and protect election integrity in response to disputes during the 2020 presidential election. Senator Hawley’s bill would improve the ability of campaigns to observe vote counting operations, require mail-in or absentee ballots to be counted and recorded immediately, and require that ballot counting, once begun, continue until completed.
“The debacle of the 2020 election has made clear that serious reforms are needed to protect the integrity of our elections. The American people deserve transparency—that means banning ballot harvesting, empowering poll watchers, and taking steps to ensure that all legally cast ballots are accounted for. The confusion and controversy of this past week is not acceptable, Congress must take action.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Background
Senator Hawley’s bill would:
Ban ballot harvesting in federal elections and incentivize states to do the same.
Require that at least two representatives of each campaign be permitted to observe polls and vote counting operations.
Require mail-in or absentee ballots to be counted and recorded immediately upon receipt, with no results to be disclosed until after the closure of polling places on the date of an election.
Require that ballot counting, once begun, continue until completed—no delays or pauses except in the event of imminent emergency.
Require states to maintain round-the-clock video surveillance monitoring of absentee ballot drop boxes, with unedited footage to be made available upon request to members of the public at no charge.
Impose requirements, adapted from existing Florida law, that mandate the auditing of voting systems and the reporting in advance of preparations made for upcoming general elections.

Title: Hawley, Joined By MO & KS Delegation Members, Urges KCI to Reject Proposed Sale from CCP-Backed Enterprise
Date: Friday, October 30, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined his colleagues in urging the Kansas City Aviation Department to reject any proposed sale of passenger boarding bridges to Kansas City International Airport (KCI) by CIMC-Tianda, a Chinese state-backed company. The lawmakers warn that CIMC-Tianda’s passenger bridges may allow the Chinese government to access the personal data of airport employees or to disrupt communications between ground control and aircraft.
The letter reads, “This poses a serious risk to American national security. The Chinese government has long used state-backed enterprises like CIMC-Tianda to advance its strategic interests. Beijing also recognizes the critical role U.S. transportation infrastructure – including our airports – plays not just in our citizens’ lives, but also in the functioning of our economy and, in times of crisis, the mobilization of our nation’s resources to protect American citizens. That is why Beijing has repeatedly targeted that infrastructure for disruption or interference using cyber and other means.”
CIMC-Tianda has a long history of illegal activity in the U.S., including industrial espionage, and was previously banned from selling passenger bridges by a U.S. district court in Houston.
Senator Hawley was joined by Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Reps. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Sam Graves (R-Mo.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).

October 30, 2020
Patrick Klein
Director of Aviation
Kansas City Aviation Department
601 Brasilia Avenue
Kansas City, MO 64153
Dear Mr. Klein:
We understand the Kansas City International Airport (KCI) has issued a request for proposals (RFP) to purchase passenger boarding bridges. We understand as well that CIMC-Tianda, a Chinese state-backed enterprise, may respond to that RFP. We urge you to reject any proposal from CIMC-Tianda in order to prevent the Chinese government from harming our nation’s aviation infrastructure and those who rely on it.
CIMC-Tianda has a long history of illegal activity in the United States. In 1998, a U.S. district court in Houston found the company guilty of industrial espionage and subsequently prohibited it from selling passenger bridges not of its own independent design until 2006. That prohibition has expired, however, and CIMC-Tianda is now trying to underbid competitors and reenter the American passenger bridge market.
This poses a serious risk to American national security. The Chinese government has long used state-backed enterprises like CIMC-Tianda to advance its strategic interests. Beijing also recognizes the critical role U.S. transportation infrastructure – including our airports – plays not just in our citizens’ lives, but also in the functioning of our economy and, in times of crisis, the mobilization of our nation’s resources to protect American citizens. That is why Beijing has repeatedly targeted that infrastructure for disruption or interference using cyber and other means.
With regard to KCI specifically, purchasing CIMC-Tianda passenger bridges could significantly enhance the Chinese government’s ability to harm Missourians, Kansans, and the nation, more broadly, by interfering with KCI’s operations. That is because new passenger bridges like those sold by CIMC-Tianda can be integrated with and potentially used to access a variety of critical systems. Chinese cyber operators might, for instance, be able to use access points provided by CIMC-Tianda bridges to steal financial and other sensitive records, including airport employees’ or others’ personal data, trigger airport alarms, or even disrupt links between ground control stations and the aircraft – and passengers – who depend on them.
Congress has already responded to Chinese threats to American transportation infrastructure by prohibiting the use of federal transit funds to purchase vehicles from Chinese state-owned and other state-supported companies. Congress is currently considering additional measures, including legislation prohibiting Chinese state-backed enterprises that have been found guilty of intellectual property theft from competing for Aircraft Improvement Program-funded projects.
We hope you will consider the risks described above and support efforts by Congress and others to protect Missourians, Kansans, and their fellow Americans from the threats posed by CIMC- Tianda, including by rejecting any proposal by CIMC-Tianda to sell passenger bridges to KCI.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Praises Upcoming Confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to U.S. Supreme Court

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) spoke on the Senate floor in support of Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate is scheduled to vote on final confirmation of Judge Barrett this evening.
Senator Hawley said,
“The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett is truly historic. This is the most openly pro-life judicial nominee to the Supreme Court in my lifetime. This is an individual who has been open in her criticism of that illegitimate decision Roe v. Wade. This is a nominee who has been open about her faith and her faith commitments and the way she and her husband live their lives immersed in their Catholic faith and raise their children in their Catholic faith and want others to have the freedom to be able to do the same.”
“And her nomination, and I anticipate her confirmation, tonight, in just a few hours on this floor, will show that there’s nothing wrong with any of that. In fact, people of faith should be welcome on the Supreme Court of the United States. People of Judge Barrett’s convictions should be welcome on the Supreme Court of the United States, and in just a few hours, in the vote of this body, we will confirm that that is indeed the case.”

U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) pledged in July that he would only support nominees for the Supreme Court whose record demonstrated that they understood Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Judge Amy Coney Barrett met this standard and earned his vote for her confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senator Hawley released the following statement after the Senate vote:
“History has been made with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. She is the most openly pro-life Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed in my lifetime. Despite being the subject of vicious attacks by the left for years, she refused to give in to the unconstitutional religious tests that Democrats sought to impose against her. This religious bigotry failed and must never be repeated.
“Judge Barrett is a stellar intellect and a fair and impartial jurist. With this confirmation, our nation’s highest Court is now more committed than ever to the rule of law and to upholding our fundamental constitutional rights. President Trump and Senate Republicans were elected to put strong constitutionalists on the Supreme Court, and that is exactly what we have in Justice Barrett.”
Senator Hawley spoke about Judge Barrett’s faith and pro-life views on the Senate floor this afternoon ahead of the vote.

Hawley calls attention to reports that food banks across Missouri have seen a significant decline in the supply and quality of food from the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, which has been a critical lifeline for thousands of Missourians during the pandemic.
“With millions out of work, businesses fighting to stay afloat, and hundreds of thousands of people joining the unemployment rolls on a weekly basis, federal nutrition programs will continue to play an essential role in helping families weather this crisis.

The Honorable Sonny Perdue
Secretary of Agriculture
U.S. Department of Agriculture
11400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20250
Dear Secretary Perdue,
It has come to my attention that food banks across my home state of Missouri have seen a significant decline in recent weeks in the supply of food made available to them through the Farmers to Families Food Box program. Several stakeholders have also told me of a drop in food quality associated with the program, as contracts with out-of-state producers have complicated the distribution process.
The Farmers to Families Food Box program has been a critical lifeline for thousands of needy families across my state throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Missouri foodbanks and other emergency nutrition providers have seen dramatic increases in demand in recent months as desperate families look for any way to make ends meet. [
1
] Reducing the amount and quality of food available through the program at this juncture is a serious cause for concern.
With millions out of work, businesses fighting to stay afloat, and hundreds of thousands of people joining the unemployment rolls on a weekly basis, federal nutrition programs will continue to play an essential role in helping families weather this crisis. The Farmers to Food Box program is a key part of the federal relief framework and should be prioritized.
Given the impending end to the program on October 31, 2020, and no announcement of additional rounds of contracts, [
2
] I ask for a response to the following questions:
What amount of CARES Act funding has been allocated to the Farmers to Families Food Box program?
Does the USDA plan to offer an additional round of contracts for the Farmers to Families Food Box program? If so, how much money will be made available for the next round, and when can the public expect an announcement in this regard?
What plans has the USDA put in place to avoid a stark end to program operations on October 31, 2020? And what communications has the USDA had with producers, distributors, and state leaders to safeguard against this?
Does the USDA have the resources available, either through CARES Act appropriations or in general USDA funds, to continue the program until at least the end of 2020? If not, what additional resources would be needed from Congress to do so?
Program dollars are distributed by formula based on county population and unemployment levels. What accountability measures are in place to ensure that poorly managed states do not get a disproportionate amount of aid to the detriment of others? How are the additional distribution challenges and costs presented by rural areas being taken into account in funding allocation decisions?
What quality control and oversight measures has the USDA taken to ensure that the highest quality foods available are being delivered in a timely manner through the Farmers to Families Food Box program?
Has USDA considered what funding level would be required to expand the program in the coming months to meet the full demand of hunger and nutrition needs?
Thank you for your attention to this important issue, and I look forward to your timely response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Resolution Condemning CCP Forced Labor In Tibet
Date: Thursday, October 22, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced a resolution
condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) use of forced labor in Tibet and demanding that American companies divest of suppliers who use Tibetan or other forced labor. The resolution also calls for an investigation into the CCP’s forced labor program, so the world can see the full extent of Beijing’s latest assault on religious freedom in Tibet.
“Beijing is using modern slavery to punish Tibetans for practicing their religious faith. This is just the latest example of the lengths to which the CCP is willing to go to impose its will on others. We must hold Beijing accountable and that starts with ending American corporations’ complicity in Chinese forced labor.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley’s resolution is a response to
recent
evidence
that the CCP is removing Tibetans from their homes and forcing them to work at state-assigned jobs, often far from their families and communities. The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).

an antitrust lawsuit against Google:
“Today’s lawsuit is the most important antitrust case in a generation. Google and its fellow Big Tech monopolists exercise unprecedented power over the lives of ordinary Americans, controlling everything from the news we read to the security of our most personal information. And Google in particular has gathered and maintained that power through illegal means. That is why I launched a sweeping antitrust investigation of Google when I was Missouri Attorney General, and that’s why I stand behind the Department of Justice’s actions today. But to be clear – this is just a first step, and I will continue to fight for the legislative solutions needed to end the tyranny of Big Tech.”

Title: Senator Hawley Blasts Facebook for Rejecting Ads from Pro-Life Groups
Date: Friday, October 16, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg questioning the company’s suspension of advertising privileges for pro-life groups, including Susan B. Anthony List and Missouri-based Choose Life Marketing. The Susan B. Anthony List ads were rejected from Facebook on the basis of a draft “fact check” from the anti-Trump news site The Dispatch, while Choose Life Marketing had its ad distribution privileges abruptly suspended with no policy explanation from Facebook.
Senator Hawley wrote, “Facebook’s censors have apparently been busy this week. Your company’s decision to restrict the spread of a story reporting on corruption allegations surrounding Hunter Biden is now a matter of national news and the subject of congressional inquiries. That makes it all the more inexplicable—or, perhaps, all the more frustratingly predictable—that Facebook would choose this same week to target pro-life content on its platform.”
This week Senator Hawley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism,
called on Facebook and Twitter CEOs
to testify on potential violations of federal election law in their censorship of the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden.

or below.
October 16, 2020
Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer
Facebook, Inc.
1 Hacker Way
Menlo Park, CA 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
Facebook’s censors have apparently been busy this week. Your company’s decision to restrict the spread of a story reporting on corruption allegations surrounding Hunter Biden is now a matter of national news and the subject of congressional inquiries. That makes it all the more inexplicable—or, perhaps, all the more frustratingly predictable—that Facebook would choose this same week to target pro-life content on its platform.
First, Choose Life Marketing—a Missouri-based advertising agency doing business with crisis pregnancy centers throughout the country—saw its ad distribution privileges abruptly suspended, without any explanation for what Facebook policy had allegedly been violated. When Choose Life Marketing sought to appeal that decision, they were informed that it might take “weeks” before Facebook could provide an explanation. Given the centrality of online advertising to businesses trying to make ends meet during the pandemic, Facebook’s insouciance is unacceptable: a weeks-long blackout risks having a crippling impact on both Choose Life Marketing and its clients.
Second, the Susan B. Anthony List—one of the nation’s most prominent pro-life groups—had its ads rejected by Facebook on the basis of a draft “fact check” from the anti-Trump news site The Dispatch. These ads described Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as supporting abortion up until the moment of birth, at taxpayer expense.
[1]
But the draft “fact check” used to “discredit” the ads acknowledged that “Biden’s views on abortion have evolved throughout the years,” culminating in a 2012 denial of any governmental “right to tell other people that . . . they can’t control their body,” and that Harris backed legislation that would “remove state restrictions on abortions.”
[2]
Additionally, the “fact check” observed that both Biden and Harris support repealing the Hyde Amendment, which presently bars federal funding for abortions.
[3]
The Susan B. Anthony List ads, in other words, are not false—as The Dispatch itself noted when it backtracked on its own “fact check.”
[4]
Voters may disagree about the specific implications of Biden and Harris’s remarks on abortion—but Facebook has no business intervening in that political debate by privileging one interpretation over others.
All of this, no doubt, is part of an increasingly troubling pattern: it has become abundantly clear that Facebook is targeting voices that dissent from the national media’s progressive consensus. Suppressing distribution of the New York Post’s reporting on the Hunter Biden corruption allegations, it appears, was just the beginning.
I look forward to learning more from you in the coming weeks, when you are under oath in a congressional hearing, about how these advertising takedown decisions were made.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
I invite you to testify, on a date to be determined before the election, at the Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing entitled “Digital Platforms and Election Interference.” As your company is no doubt aware, corporations are forbidden from contributing anything of value—financial or otherwise—to support the election of candidates for public office. Accordingly, this hearing will consider potential campaign law violations arising from your company’s decision, on October 14, 2020, to support the presidential campaign of Joe Biden by suppressing the distribution of a New York Post article entitled “Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad.”
Committee rules require that you provide your testimony and curriculum vitae for distribution to members of the Committee and the press at least 24 hours before the hearing is scheduled to begin. Please send an electronic copy of your testimony and curriculum vitae to Jason_Covey@judiciary-rep.senate.gov.
Please contact Jason Covey at (202) 224-5225 with any questions. We look forward to your testimony.
Sincerely,

This hearing will consider potential campaign law violations arising from your company’s decision, on October 14, 2020, to support the presidential campaign of Joe Biden by asymmetrically applying its terms of service and restricting the distribution of a New York Post article entitled “Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad,” as well as by suspending the official account of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump for discussing this story. It will also consider your company’s decision to double down on that potential violation by, on October 15, 2020, suppressing the Post’s follow-up story.
Committee rules require that you provide your testimony and curriculum vitae for distribution to members of the Committee and the press at least 24 hours before the hearing is scheduled to begin.

Title: Hawley Demands Answers from Facebook Over Censorship of Hunter Biden Article
Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding the company’s decision to censor a story regarding Hunter Biden’s contacts with Ukrainian energy executives.
Senator Hawley asked Facebook whether it is normal policy to reduce distribution of articles before they have been fact-checked, if they have any evidence the story contains disinformation, and whether any member of the Biden-Harris campaign encouraged or requested Facebook suppress the story.

Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer

Menlo Park, CA 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
Today, the New York Post released a story revealing that Hunter Biden facilitated a meeting with a Ukrainian energy executive and his father, who was then serving as Vice President. In it, the Post offers evidence that directly contradicts the claims of the Democratic nominee for president, who had previously stated that he has “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” Yet it has come to my attention that this news report—one clearly relevant to the public interest—has been censored on Facebook.
A representative from your company has publicly stated that Facebook will be “reducing [the story’s] distribution on our platform” while a third-party fact-check takes place. The seemingly selective nature of this public intervention suggests partiality on the part of Facebook. And your efforts to suppress the distribution of content revealing potentially unethical activity by a candidate for president raises a number of additional questions, to which I expect responses immediately.
Is it your normal policy to reduce the distribution of stories on your platform before they have been fact-checked? If so, what is your specific policy and where is such policy stated?
If you have evidence that this news story contains “disinformation” or have otherwise determined that there are inaccuracies with the reporting, will you disclose them to the public so that they can assess your findings?
Why did you endeavor to publicly state that such a story was subject to a fact-check? Isn’t such a public intervention itself a reflection of Facebook’s assessment of a news report’s credibility?
Did any member of the Biden-Harris presidential campaign team or any person representing themselves as a representative of the campaign’s interests ask, encourage, or direct Facebook to suppress the New York Post story?
The New York Post previously reported that employees of the six largest Silicon Valley tech firms – including Facebook – have donated nearly $5 million to the Biden-Harris campaign, compared to just $239,000 to President Trump’s campaign. What steps has Facebook taken to ensure that your employees political preferences don’t influence decisions to suppress content?
Thank you for your attention to this matter important to fairness and impartiality in our presidential election process.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley Questions Dorsey Over Twitter Blackout of Hunter Biden Story
Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020

Content:
Today, following his letter to Facebook, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey regarding the company’s decision to prevent users from sharing the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden in any capacity.
“I find this behavior stunning but not surprising from a platform that has censored the President of the United States,”
writes Senator Hawley.
“This statement raises questions about the applicability of your policy, especially because such a pre-emptive removal of a news story on such grounds—and the additional scrutiny you have applied—appears to be an unusual intervention that is not universally applied to all content.”
Senator Hawley asks how Twitter determined that the Post’s story violated their policies, why Twitter locked the Post’s account, and what evidence they have that the story contains disinformation.

Mr. Jack Dorsey
Chief Executive Officer
Twitter
355 Market Street, Suite 900
San Francisco, CA 94103
Dear Mr. Dorsey:
As you may know, earlier today a representative from Facebook publicly stated that a news story from the New York Post would be censored while undergoing a third-party fact-check. Facebook provided no justification for doing so, a particularly glaring omission in light of the fact that the same news story reported on newly uncovered e-mails suggesting the Democratic nominee for president may have engaged in unethical activity with respect to the foreign business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden.
Sadly, it appears that Facebook is not alone. There are various reports circulating on Twitter of users unable to post a link to the New York Post story, with some users posting responses from Twitter that the content was deemed to be “potentially spammy or unsafe.” I find this behavior stunning but not surprising from a platform that has censored the President of the United States. Thankfully, a congressional letter contains no such restrictions on content distribution, so I have included the link to the story in question in the footnote below for your reference.
[1]
A Twitter representative has since stated that “in line with our Hacked Materials Policy, as well as our approach to blocking URLs, we are taking action to block any links to or images of the material in question on Twitter.”
[2]
This statement raises questions about the applicability of your policy, especially because such a pre-emptive removal of a news story on such grounds—and the additional scrutiny you have applied—appears to be an unusual intervention that is not universally applied to all content.
I ask that you immediately answer these questions and provide the requisite justifications so that your users can feel confident that you are not seeking to influence the outcome of the presidential election with your content removal decisions.
How did Twitter determine that the New York Post story was a violation of its policy governing the distribution of hacked materials or approach to blocking links? Will Twitter make its decision-making process with regard to this case of content removal publicly available?
How did Twitter find that the New York Post was “directly” distributing hacked materials—and thus in violation of its policy—when it is not clear that this is the case?
Why did Twitter take additional, unprecedented action to lock the primary Twitter account of the New York Post, one of the nation’s most widely distributed newspapers?
[3]
If you have evidence that this news story contains “disinformation” or have otherwise determined that there are inaccuracies with the reporting, will you disclose them to the public so that they can assess your findings?
Did any member of the Biden-Harris presidential campaign team or any person representing themselves as a representative of the campaign’s interests ask, encourage, or direct Twitter to suppress the New York Post story?
I await your reply.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Calls for FEC Investigation of Potential In-Kind Contributions from Twitter and Facebook to Biden Campaign
Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote a
letter
to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) General Counsel expressing serious concerns about the possibility of campaign finance violations benefitting the Biden campaign in Twitter and Facebook’s suppression of the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden. Senator Hawley writes that, as the Biden campaign derives value from the suppression of the story, the companies may have therefore made in-kind contributions to the campaign.
Senator Hawley writes, “These possible campaign-finance violations by two of the most powerful corporations in America comes only weeks before Election Day, and while millions of Americans are in the midst of voting. I ask that the FEC take immediate action to investigate these potential violations and, if appropriate, take remedial action to prevent further interference with the 2020 Presidential election.”
Senator Hawley has also today written letters to
Facebook

Twitter
demanding answers regarding their censorship of the story.

October 14, 2020
Lisa J. Stevenson
Acting General Counsel
Federal Election Commission
Office of General Counsel
1050 First Street, NE
Washington, DC 20463
Dear Ms. Stevenson:
I write to express serious concern about the possibility that egregious campaign-finance violations benefitting the Biden campaign may be playing out in real time, just weeks before the presidential election. Earlier today, the New York Post published a bombshell report that Hunter Biden facilitated a meeting between a Ukrainian energy executive and his father, who was then Vice President. The Post article cites evidence that would directly contradict Joe Biden’s claim that he has “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”
The Post’s reporting has understandably attracted substantial public discussion. And countless Americans have sought to discuss and debate that article via the forums in which so much of our political speech occurs: on social media. But two social-media platforms have engaged in unprecedented suppression of public discussion of the article. Twitter is blocking all tweets and direct messages that contain the URL for the Post article. Facebook has stated that it is “reducing [the story’s] distribution on our platform,” though the specifics of how Facebook will implement this remain opaque.
This conduct does not merely censor the core political speech of ordinary Americans, though it certainly does that. Twitter’s and Facebook’s conduct also appears to constitute a clear violation of federal campaign-finance law. Federal law prohibits any corporation from making a contribution to a federal candidate for office. 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a). Twitter and Facebook are both corporations. A “contribution” includes “anything of value . . . for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.” 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i). Twitter’s and Facebook’s active suppression of public speech about the New York Post article appears to constitute contributions under federal law. There can be no serious doubt that the Biden campaign derives extraordinary value from depriving voters access to information that, if true, would link the former Vice President to corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs. And this censorship manifestly will influence the presidential election.
These possible campaign-finance violations by two of the most powerful corporations in America comes only weeks before Election Day, and while millions of Americans are in the midst of voting. I ask that the FEC take immediate action to investigate these potential violations and, if appropriate, take remedial action to prevent further interference with the 2020 presidential election.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Sen. Hawley: Tech insiders are trying to gut provisions of NDAA that would restrict use of Chinese tech products
Date: Thursday, October 01, 2020

Senator Hawley spoke out this morning against tech insiders’ attempts to gut provisions in the FY 2021 NDAA that would end the Department of Defense’s (DoD) dangerous overreliance on Chinese printed circuit boards (PCBs).
Tech insiders are trying to gut provisions of the defense funding bill that would restrict use of Chinese tech products. Senate negotiators, don’t give in! This is not the time to go soft on
#China
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
October 1, 2020
Senator Hawley and his colleagues introduced provisions to secure DoD’s PCB supply chains in the Senate and House versions of the FY 2021 NDAA. His provision can be found in Sec. 808 on pages 502-509 of the
Senate NDAA.
DoD uses PCBs in nearly all of its electronic systems, including many critical ones. Far too many of those PCBs are currently sourced from China. This poses an unacceptable risk to our national security. Not only can the Chinese government sabotage PCBs sold for use by DoD. It can also sever DoD’s access to Chinese PCBs altogether, jeopardizing U.S. military operations and modernization efforts alike.
The provisions introduced by Senator Hawley and his colleagues end DoD’s overreliance on Chinese PCBs by requiring the Department to move key parts of its PCB supply chains out of China and into the United States and other trusted nations. The provisions simultaneously strengthen U.S. industry and make sure we are never again dependent on a foreign adversary for the components our military needs to protect the American people.

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and a group of colleagues joined Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in introducing a bipartisan
resolution
to recognize September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
“Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is a time for us to honor the strength of the children who have fought the unthinkable. Together, we celebrate survivors of childhood cancer, honor their families, and remember those who are no longer with us.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“Last year during an event in West Virginia, Nick Spence, a student and survivor of childhood cancer, approached me with the great idea to dedicate September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Shortly after, I led my colleagues in introducing a resolution to do just that. This year, we are reintroducing the resolution to ensure that September is dedicated to childhood cancer and raising awareness about this terrible battle many of our children face every day. I am incredibly proud of Nick for standing up for this important cause and look forward to the Senate passing our bipartisan resolution,”
said Senator Manchin.
Additional cosponsors on this resolution include Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Shelley Capito (R-W.Va.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on Schumer, Democrats to Reject Attacks on Supreme Court Justice Nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s Faith
Date: Saturday, September 26, 2020

Content:
Following President Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling on every member of the Democratic Caucus to publicly reject attacks on Judge Barrett’s Christian faith and abstain from anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, anti-faith vitriol in the hearings to come.
During Judge Barrett’s nomination hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Senate Democrats attacked her faith, including Senator Dianne Feinstein disparaging her Catholicism by saying “the dogma lives loudly within you,” Senator Dick Durbin asking if she was an “orthodox Catholic,” and Senator Mazie Hirono suggesting she would be a “Catholic judge” who might not be able to follow federal law.
“There is a long history of anti-Catholic hatred by some in this country, and a growing tide of anti-religious animus on the Left now, and I hope you and your colleagues will not play any further part in it,”
Senator Hawley writes.
“These attacks and insinuations remain disgusting. Religious bigotry has no place in the United States Senate. I ask that you and all your colleagues reject your past acts of intolerance, and commit to considering Judge Barrett’s nomination on the merits of her qualifications, not by slandering her faith—and the faith of millions of Americans.”

September 26, 2020
The Honorable Charles E. Schumer
Minority Leader
United States Senate
S-221 The Capitol
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Minority Leader Schumer:
Now that President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States, I call on you and every member of the Democratic Caucus to publicly reject Senator Dianne Feinstein’s egregious personal attacks on Judge Barrett’s Christian faith during her previous confirmation hearings, and to pledge you will abstain from that kind of anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, anti-faith vitriol in the hearings to come. You owe it to the country.
As you will recall, Senator Feinstein, the most senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told Judge Barrett in her previous hearings that “the dogma lives loudly within you,” a clear and condescending disparagement of Judge Barrett’s Catholicism. Senator Feinstein was not alone. Senator Durbin also interrogated Judge Barrett’s religious beliefs and asked whether she was an “orthodox Catholic.” And Senator Hirono suggested that Judge Barrett would not simply be a federal judge, but a “Catholic judge,” who might not be able to follow the law. Already, members of your caucus have said that they will do this again—that the nominee’s religious views will be a prime focus.
Over and over these last four years, your caucus has sought to return to the days of “religious tests,” to exclude people of faith from public office and from the public square. Your members have attacked and attempted to disqualify nominees by questioning their views on the nature of sin, their beliefs about heaven and hell, their memberships in religious organizations, and the activities of their churches. But our Constitution bans religious tests. Democrats’ offensive and wholly inappropriate attacks must not be repeated in this confirmation process.
There is a long history of anti-Catholic hatred by some in this country, and a growing tide of anti-religious animus on the Left now, and I hope you and your colleagues will not play any further part in it.
These attacks and insinuations remain disgusting. Religious bigotry has no place in the United States Senate. I ask that you and all your colleagues reject your past acts of intolerance, and commit to considering Judge Barrett’s nomination on the merits of her qualifications, not by slandering her faith—and the faith of millions of Americans.

Title: Hawley Asks DOJ to File Suit Against Unconstitutional Restrictions on Houses of Worship
Date: Thursday, September 17, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General William Barr urging him to immediately file suit in federal court to protect religious liberties in states placing unconstitutional restrictions on houses of worship. Senator Hawley writes that a number of states are violating the First Amendment in strictly limiting attendance at religious services while allowing other businesses, like restaurants and gyms, to operate at up to 50 percent capacity.
Senator Hawley wrote, “The American people have endured six months of closures and restrictions on their houses of worship. Over that period, they have faced countless harms: missed holidays and religious celebrations, canceled weddings, and unattended funerals, to say nothing of the painful absence of regular worship. These continued violations of the First Amendment are outrageous. I ask that the Department file suit against these jurisdictions and others to uphold Americans’ rights.”
In June 2020, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Attorney General Barr calling for a civil rights investigation into First Amendment violations by state officials imposing unequal regulations on religious services.

September 17, 2020
The Honorable William P. Barr
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
I am writing to urge you to immediately bring lawsuits in federal court to uphold the constitutional right to free exercise and the rights of houses of worship being unjustly shuttered.
I previously wrote to you on June 9, 2020, asking the Department to “bring whatever lawsuits are necessary to secure the First Amendment rights of all Americans.” That letter followed your April 27 memorandum stating that the Department had issued guidance to states and localities about their constitutional obligation not to infringe on religious free exercise.
But unconstitutional restrictions on religious exercise remain in many parts of the country, despite an ebb in COVID-19 cases and the lessening of other restrictions. Many houses of worship and other religious organizations are being treated more harshly than other institutions.
In San Francisco, California, for example, churches continue to be under orders limiting religious services to twelve people, and only if done outdoors, while gyms have been allowed to let patrons inside. In many parts of Washington State, churches are subject to a specially burdensome 25 percent capacity limitation, while restaurants and other businesses are allowed up to 50 percent of capacity. At the same time, churches that assert their right to free exercise are being hit with massive fines—as much as $100,000 in some cases—for the offense of gathering to worship in person.
The American people have endured six months of closures and restrictions on their houses of worship. Over that period, they have faced countless harms: missed holidays and religious celebrations, canceled weddings, and unattended funerals, to say nothing of the painful absence of regular worship. These continued violations of the First Amendment are outrageous. I ask that the Department file suit against these jurisdictions and others to uphold Americans’ rights.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: New Hawley Bill Will Aid Working Families Struggling With School Disruption
Date: Thursday, September 17, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will introduce the
Helping Parents During COVID Act of 2020
to provide immediate financial relief for working families whose children’s education has been disrupted by the pandemic. Senator Hawley’s bill would provide these working families $1,200 in direct cash assistance per month every month through June 2021 to help cover lost work shifts or wages. This bill will also create a fully-refundable tax credit of $800 per child to reimburse parents for the costs of education expenses.
The direct cash assistance and the credit will be means-tested. Both the cash assistance and the credit begin to phase out at $75,000 for individual filers and $150,000 those for filing jointly.
“I have been calling for assistance for working families since day one and the return of the school year only makes the issue that much more urgent. School closures, disruption of the standard academic calendar, hybrid and distance-learning models, and other changes have forced parents to seek alternative work arrangements or leave the workforce altogether. Since the government has asked them to deal with these realities, it falls on us to help them through it. Working families need relief as soon as possible.”

Title: Missouri Law Enforcement Officers Applaud Senator Hawley’s Bill to Support Police
Date: Wednesday, September 16, 2020

Content:
In the week since U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
David Dorn Back the Blue Act, the bill has been met with an outpouring of support from Missouri law enforcement officers. Senator Hawley’s bill would authorize $15 billion for the U.S. Attorney General to fund more officer hiring and salary increases for state and local law enforcement across the country.
“Senator Hawley understands the struggles our police are facing each day. The Missouri Police Chiefs Association fully supports Senator Hawley’s bill to raise police salaries and hire new officers. It comes at a critical time for law enforcement which are too often underfunded and facing increased threats to their safety. We thank Senator Hawley for continuing to be a champion for law enforcement.”
—
Missouri Police Chiefs Association
“As an elected Sheriff, I fully endorse Senator Hawley’s effort to provide much needed pay raises for our state and local law enforcement officers. His ‘David Dorn Back the Blue Act’ will provide more resources and manpower to our departments to help keep St. Charles County and the entire state of Missouri safe.”
—
Sheriff Scott Lewis, St. Charles County
“Thank you, Senator Hawley, for introducing the ‘David Dorn Back the Blue Act’. I have been in law enforcement for 25 years and acutely aware that those men and women working in this profession are significantly underpaid. These men and women of law enforcement have agreed to serve and protect their communities. They have agreed to do so under any dire circumstance that may come their way. It only makes sense that we reimburse them in a way that reflects our appreciation. When you consider that those serving in law enforcement are willing to sacrifice so much, from special days with families to even their own health and safety this bill is a firm thank you for that service. While law enforcement officers don’t necessarily get into this profession for pay, it is nice to be able to have some financial peace while agreeing to serve the community. Thank you, sir, for your efforts to raise our salaries in law enforcement. It is comforting to know that, while we are out on the streets keeping citizens safe, you’ve got our six.”
—
Sheriff Randee Kaiser, Jasper County
“This bill introduced by Senator Hawley will help bring back safety and security for our citizens. We’ve all seen the struggles our communities are facing.  Because of this, Police agencies across the nation are experiencing severe retention and recruitment issues. At a time where our communities need us the most, we simply don’t have the personnel resources we need. Many feel the pay is simply not worth all the risks.  This bill would provide safety for our citizens, and that’s something we all want.”
—
Chief Jim McMillen, Sikeston Department of Public Safety
“I think it is refreshing that someone in DC is addressing what we in law enforcement already know is an epidemic. Police officer recruit numbers are dwindling and the profession is under attack, and no departments are more vulnerable in the current climate than those in rural Missouri.” — Chief Joey Higgerson, New Madrid Police Department
“I am honored to support this bill with Senator Hawley.  Something must be done to support Law Enforcement and also to improve our training and staffing issues.”
—
Chief Jarrett Bullock, Malden Police Department
“Josh has never wavered from strongly supporting law enforcement, and that is an anomaly up there in the swamp.”
—
Chief Danny Whiteley, Poplar Bluff Police Department
“Once again, Senator Hawley has demonstrated that he not only understands the public safety crisis our communities face, but he recognizes the need for someone in D.C. to stand up for the men and women who stand in harm’s way to protect our citizens from violence. Our officers know Senator Hawley has not forgotten them and that he is fighting to protect our communities.”
—
Columbia Police Officers Association
“I believe the bill introduced by Senator Hawley is an excellent approach to improving law enforcement across the country and specifically in Southeast Missouri. Police departments in our region suffer from attrition to larger cities and, frankly, other occupations due to compensation and workload issues. Increasing funding for additional officers to mitigate workload concerns and increasing salaries to promote hiring and retention would be very beneficial.”
—
Chief Wes Blair, Cape Girardeau Police Department
“I appreciate the support and aggressive action from Sen. Hawley to address this issue in the current atmosphere of defunding police.  In these uncertain times, it is a beacon of hope for all law enforcement.”
—
Sheriff Ruth Ann Dickerson, Cape Girardeau County
“This bill, if it allows for the addition of police officers and would fund those positions, that would huge for the department, being able to go out and make sure we’re addressing even more specific needs of the community.”

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on Facebook to Reconsider Ban on Political Advertising
Date: Tuesday, September 15, 2020

Content:
Today, in response to Facebook’s
recent announcement
that it will ban political advertising in the week leading up the November 2020 elections, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking that he reconsider his decision. Senator Hawley writes that Facebook’s decision could have the effect of suppressing voter turnout and includes an overly broad blackout of advertising related to “social issues.”
“In a culture in which virtually every issue—from knitting and yoga to sushi and young-adult fiction—has become aggressively politicized, any topic can be deemed ‘sensitive’ in the right context. Given Facebook’s sweeping powers to shape the news and information that Americans receive, clarity on Facebook’s understanding of these terms is critical.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley calls for Facebook to respond by September 23, 2020 clarifying how it defines a “political” or “issue” ad, whether news or opinion outlets will be allowed to promote stories related to the election, and whether advocacy groups like Planned Parenthood or NARAL will be permitted to advertise on Facebook during the blackout.

Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer
Facebook, Inc.

Menlo Park, CA 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
On September 3, Facebook announced it would be implementing a new policy of banning political advertising on its platform during the seven days leading up to the November 2020 election, as well as attaching “informational labels” to posts that “seek[] to delegitimize the outcome of the election or discuss the legitimacy of voting methods.” [
1
] I urge you and your company to reconsider these policies.
According to Facebook, the advertising blackout does not merely extend to overt political content. It also applies to advertising linked to “social issues” which Facebook has defined as “sensitive topics that are heavily debated, may influence the outcome of an election or result in/relate to existing or proposed legislation.” [
2
] In a culture in which virtually every issue—from knitting [
3
] and yoga [
4
] to sushi [
5
] and young-adult fiction [
6
]—has become aggressively politicized, any topic can be deemed “sensitive” in the right context. Given Facebook’s sweeping powers to shape the news and information that Americans receive, clarity on Facebook’s understanding of these terms is critical.
In light of the high stakes involved in this issue, I request a response to the following questions no later than September 23, 2020:
How does Facebook specifically define a “political” or “issue” ad? Would an advertisement explaining how citizens can protect themselves against mob violence, or an ad for concealed-carry firearms training, run afoul of Facebook’s blackout?
Will all news and opinion websites be permitted to publish and promote stories pertaining to the election or to “sensitive” topics during the “political advertising” blackout? If not, what criteria will Facebook use in determining whether a source is “political” in nature?
Will Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other abortion advocacy groups be permitted to advertise on Facebook during the blackout, notwithstanding the fact that their work is the epitome of a “sensitive topic” that is “heavily debated”?
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Urges HHS Secretary to Utilize CARES Act Resources to Curb Rising Drug Abuse and Mental Health Disorders
Date: Monday, September 14, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar urging him to address mental health needs and combat the
rising trend
of substance abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic across America, including Missouri. The CARES Act appropriated $425 million to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within HHS to boost services during the pandemic.
In the letter, Senator Hawley calls on Secretary Azar to continue deploying these resources and assist state health departments, local officials, and practitioners to address mental health needs of Americans during this public health emergency.
“I’ve seen reports from across Missouri describing significant increases in Narcan (Naloxone) doses deployed by emergency service providers to combat drug overdoses. I am concerned that increases in social isolation, anxiety, and despair due to the pandemic may be contributing to surges in drug addiction. As your Department continues to take unprecedented action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I urge you to also address the mental health needs of those Americans impacted by pandemic-related disruptions.”

September 14, 2020
The Honorable Alex Azar
Secretary
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
200 Independence Avenue, S.W.
Washington, D.C.
20201
Dear Secretary Azar:
I write today about mental health needs and substance abuse treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past several months, I’ve seen reports from across Missouri describing significant increases in Narcan (Naloxone) doses deployed by emergency service providers to combat drug overdoses.
1
I am concerned that increases in social isolation, anxiety, and despair due to the pandemic may be contributing to surges in drug addiction. As your Department continues to take unprecedented action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I urge you to also address the mental health needs of those Americans impacted by pandemic-related disruptions.
It appears that the coronavirus pandemic has been accompanied by a rise in mental health disorders, a development that deserves serious scrutiny. According to surveys, approximately 53% of U.S. adults have reported that stress and worry brought about by the pandemic has negatively impacted their mental health.
2
These pandemic-related challenges have affected nearly every age category. For example, the prevalence of depression has increased markedly in college-aged students and teenagers, a group that was already experiencing worsening overall mental health.
3
And for those at greatest risk for the coronavirus, such as older Americans, loneliness due to social isolation and distancing has skyrocketed.
4
In addition, new data suggests that untreated substance abuse is increasing in kind. For those seeking care for drug addiction, reports indicate that treatment facilities are under severe strain due to pandemic-related interruptions.
5
The American Medical Association has recently raised concerns about reports of increases of opioid-related mortality in 40 states.
6
This is especially alarming in light of major efforts by federal and state authorities over the past several years to reduce deaths of despair. Missouri, for example, saw a decrease in opioid-related deaths in 2019 compared to 2018.
7
We must not allow this pandemic to reverse progress that has been made.
As you know, in the CARES Act, Congress appropriated $425 million to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within HHS to boost mental health and substance abuse treatment services during the pandemic. I’m encouraged by the actions SAMHSA has already taken, such as rapidly disbursing $14 million in CARES Act funding to Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics in Missouri as well as establishing an emergency grant program targeted at suicide prevention.
8
Yet I believe there is more that can be done to increase access to services.
I ask that you build upon these previous efforts and engage all appropriate divisions within the Department to develop guidelines and resources to assist state health departments, local officials, and practitioners seeking to treat mental health disorders and drug addiction in light of the coronavirus pandemic. I further request that you provide my office with a report on the Department’s work in this area using CARES Act resources along with any legislative recommendations that may be necessary to address the unique mental health needs of Americans during this public health emergency.
Thank you for your work on this issue and your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for CFIUS to Reject TikTok Partnership, Violates President’s Executive Order
Date: Monday, September 14, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley
sent a letter
to Secretary Steve Mnuchin calling on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to reject Oracle’s proposed partnership with ByteDance to obtain control of TikTok’s U.S. operations. Senator Hawley writes that the proposed partnership allows for continued Chinese Communist Party control of TikTok, putting American data at risk and violating President Trump’s executive order.
Senator Hawley writes, “CFIUS should promptly reject any Oracle-ByteDance collaboration and send the ball back to ByteDance’s court so that the company can come up with a more acceptable solution. ByteDance can still pursue a full sale of TikTok, its code, and its algorithm to a U.S. company, so that the app can be rebuilt from the ground up to remove any trace of CCP influence. Or perhaps, given constraints imposed by Chinese law, the only feasible way to maintain Americans’ security is to effectively ban the TikTok app in the United States altogether. In any event, an ongoing ‘partnership’ that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President’s Executive Order of August 6.”
Read the full letter
here
or below.
September 14, 2020
Hon. Steven T. Mnuchin
Chair
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Dear Secretary Mnuchin:
The Chinese company ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok threatens the national security of the United States.
President Trump made that crystal clear on August 6, when he issued an executive order finding that “TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories,” that “TikTok also reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive,” and that TikTok “may also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party.”
[1]
That was why the executive order prohibited “any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd.”—TikTok’s Chinese parent company—at the end of a 45-day period.
All of those same threats persist today. China’s repressive intelligence laws, which allow the seizure of data from Chinese companies like ByteDance if the Chinese Communist Party comes knocking, still remain in force. And that is why any corporate shell game that leaves TikTok in the hands of ByteDance will simply perpetuate the original problem, leaving U.S. national interests and everyday users at serious risk.
Despite these realities, earlier today Oracle Corporation publicly confirmed reporting from last night that it had reached an agreement to serve as the “trusted technology provider” for TikTok’s operations.
[2]
It is far from clear what this arrangement entails—doubly so because ByteDance has expressly disclaimed any intention of selling the TikTok algorithm or code.
[3]
Some reports suggest that ByteDance’s reticence may be due to new Chinese export control rules, which allegedly restrict the sale of technologies such as TikTok’s recommendation algorithm.
[4]
But regardless of the reason, the available evidence compels only one conclusion: ByteDance has no intention whatsoever of relinquishing ultimate control of TikTok. ByteDance, as TikTok’s parent company, will continue to be subject to Chinese laws that put Americans’ data at risk. That is precisely the problem that the President’s action sought to solve, and it is that same problem that the proposed Oracle partnership leaves fully intact. In short, the proposal violates the President’s executive order.
CFIUS should promptly reject any Oracle-ByteDance collaboration and send the ball back to ByteDance’s court so that the company can come up with a more acceptable solution. ByteDance can still pursue a full sale of TikTok, its code, and its algorithm to a U.S. company, so that the app can be rebuilt from the ground up to remove any trace of CCP influence. Or perhaps, given constraints imposed by Chinese law, the only feasible way to maintain Americans’ security is to effectively ban the TikTok app in the United States altogether. In any event, an ongoing “partnership” that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President’s Executive Order of August 6.
American national security is on the line. I strongly urge you and the other members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to immediately reject the proposed Oracle-ByteDance partnership. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on Netflix to Take Down Cuties
Date: Friday, September 11, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings calling for the removal of Cuties, a controversial new film that depicts preteens engaged in sexually explicit dance routines, from the platform. Senator Hawley asks why Netflix chose to market the film with a poster solely depicting scantily clad preteens in sexual positions, if Netflix took any measures to protect the child actors made to perform simulated sex acts, and exactly what audience Netflix is attempting to target with this movie.
Senator Hawley writes, “In early 2019, journalists first began to report that YouTube videos of children in partial states of exposure were being ‘inundated with comments’ by pedophiles, exposing the children involved in the videos and other children visiting the platform to potential harm. Now Netflix is airing a film called
Cuties
depicting children being coached to engage in simulated sexual acts, for cameras both onscreen and off. Your decision to do so raises major questions of child safety and exploitation, including the possibility of copycat behavior and exploitation of child actors.”
Full text of the
letter

Reed Hastings
Chief Executive Officer
Netflix, Inc.
100 Winchester Circle
Los Gatos, CA 95032
Dear Mr. Hastings:
In early 2019, journalists first began to report that YouTube videos of children in partial states of exposure were being “inundated with comments” by pedophiles, exposing the children involved in the videos and other children visiting the platform to potential harm.
[1]
Now Netflix is airing a film called Cuties depicting children being coached to engage in simulated sexual acts, for cameras both onscreen and off. Your decision to do so raises major questions of child safety and exploitation, including the possibility of copycat behavior and exploitation of child actors.
Please respond to the following questions no later than Friday, September 18, 2020. And in the interim, please immediately remove this film from your platform.
Why did your company designate this film with a “TV-MA” for “language” without any mention of its graphic sexual content?
In marketing this film, did Netflix consult with any experts or authorities on combating child sexual exploitation or the psychological and emotional impacts of the sexualization of minors?
In marketing this film, did Netflix consult with any law enforcement authorities or experts about the possibility of copycat behavior, such as the viewing and imitation of hardcore pornography, by children who may see this film?
Did Netflix, at any point, take measures to ensure the protection of the physical, mental, and emotional health of child actors made to perform simulated sex acts and filmed in sexual or sexually suggestive ways?
Why did your company choose to market this film—which touches on a range of issues including religion, culture, and social media—with a poster solely depicting scantily clad preteens in sexually suggestive positions?
[2]
Why did your company choose to market this film with a poster different from the French original, which depicts children throwing confetti in the street?
[3]
What internal algorithmic designations has Netflix appended to this film, and what are the primary algorithmic characteristics of the film’s primary viewership as of today, September 11, 2020?
We will await your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Condemns Disney for Whitewashing Genocide in Production of Mulan, Asks Whether They Will Pull Film
Date: Wednesday, September 09, 2020

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Disney CEO Robert Chapek condemning the company for whitewashing the ongoing genocide of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities during the production of Mulan. In producing the movie, Disney traveled to the Xinjiang province where atrocities are occurring, collaborated with local Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda organs, and gave “special thanks” to a CCP agency in charge of administering concentration camps in Xinjiang. Senator Hawley writes that Disney has crossed the line from complacency into complicity.
“For nearly a century, Disney has told stories, produced films, and built theme parks that inspired us, brought us together, and showed us the very best of what American had to offer the world. Your decision to uncritically approve this film’s release rather than apologizing to those harmed by Disney’s actions is reprehensible. Your decision to put profit over principle, to not just ignore the CCP’s genocide and other atrocities but to aid and abet them, is an affront to American values.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley asks Disney whether they will pull Mulan from Disney+ to avoid further glorifying CCP officials and agencies responsible for the atrocities in Xinjiang. He also requests that Disney explain what assistance they received from CCP agencies involved in the genocide and how the agencies were compensated.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
September 9, 2020
Robert Chapek
Chief Executive Officer
The Walt Disney Company
114 5th Ave #13
New York, NY 10011
Dear Mr. Chapek:
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing genocide in Xinjiang—and not just cultural genocide either. There was a time when Beijing might have been satisfied with enslaving Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities, even as it tortured them into abandoning their beliefs and swearing loyalty to the Party.
[
1
]
But that is no longer the case. Now Beijing appears intent on destroying the Uyghur people. And it has rolled out a sophisticated campaign to do just that, including by systematically sterilizing Uyghur women and aborting their children.
[
2
]
On August 13, 2018, Walt Disney Studios announced that production had begun on Mulan.
[
3
]
By that time, numerous reports had been released by the U.S. government and non-government organizations concerning the mass internment of Uyghurs and others in camps in Xinjiang.
[
4
]
But that did not stop Disney from going to Xinjiang to film Mulan. Nor did it stop Disney from collaborating with the Chinese officials directly responsible for the atrocities at those camps.
The Mulan closing credits tell the story. Nine minutes into the ten-minute credit roll, Disney gives “special thanks” to the Turpan Public Security Bureau—the very same bureau responsible for administering the concentration camps in the Turpan jurisdiction. Disney also chose to give “special thanks” to several CCP propaganda organs, including the Xinjiang Communist Party’s publicity department. These agencies are tasked with spreading disinformation about the atrocities in Xinjiang in order to shield Beijing from accountability.
Disney’s whitewashing of the ongoing Uyghur genocide is contrary to all of your company’s supposed principles. Just a few weeks ago, for instance, you wrote about the need to “confront the inscrutable idea that the lives of some are deemed less valuable—and less worthy of dignity, care and protection—than the lives of others.”
[
5
]
Elsewhere, Disney has declared its commitment “to providing comfort, inspiration, and opportunity to children and families around the world” and described its “commitment to respect human rights” as a “core value.”
[
6
]
How exactly does giving “special thanks” to the officials responsible for imprisoning, torturing, and forcibly sterilizing millions of people because of their ethnicities and beliefs align with your supposed commitment to promoting human dignity and respecting human rights? How does glorifying the Chinese authorities perpetrating abuses in Xinjiang provide comfort, inspiration, and opportunity to Uyghur children—including those who were never born because the CCP forced their mothers to abort them? Disney’s actions here cross the line from complacency into complicity.
For nearly a century, Disney has told stories, produced films, and built theme parks that inspired us, brought us together, and showed us the very best of what American had to offer the world. Your decision to uncritically approve this film’s release rather than apologizing to those harmed by Disney’s actions is reprehensible. Your decision to put profit over principle, to not just ignore the CCP’s genocide and other atrocities but to aid and abet them, is an affront to American values.
As you contemplate your next steps, I request your answers to the following questions:
Does Disney agree that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for imprisoning and torturing Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang?
Why did Disney choose to film portions of Mulan in Xinjiang, despite the fact that the Chinese Communist Party was imprisoning and torturing Uyghurs and others in Xinjiang at the same time?
What assistance did Disney receive from the Turpan Public Security Bureau and other Chinese government agencies involved in the atrocities in Xinjiang?
How did Disney compensate the Turpan Public Security Bureau and other Chinese agencies for any assistance rendered? Is Disney still providing compensation to the Chinese entities listed in the Mulan closing credits, and does it plan to provide compensation to these entities in the future?
Has Disney coordinated, collaborated, or otherwise engaged with any of the Chinese actors that have been designated for sanctions by the Treasury Department on account of their contributions to the atrocities in Xinjiang?
Does Disney condemn the atrocities committed by the Chinese Communist Party against Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang?
Will Disney sever its relationships with the Chinese Communist Party in response to the Party’s abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and elsewhere?
Will Disney pull Mulan from Disney+ in order to avoid any further glorification of Xinjiang or validation of the Chinese Communist Party officials and agencies responsible for the atrocities in that province?
Will Disney donate any of the profits drawn from Mulan to non-governmental organizations dedicated to fighting human trafficking and the other atrocities underway in Xinjiang?
Please deliver your responses to these questions to my office by September 30, 2020. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces ‘David Dorn Back the Blue Act’ to Allocate $15B to Raise Police Salaries, Hire More Officers
Date: Tuesday, September 08, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will introduce the
David Dorn Back the Blue Act
to raise police officer salaries and increase officer hiring and retention. Senator Hawley’s bill would amend the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968
to authorize $15 billion for the U.S. Attorney General to fund more officer hiring and salary increases for state and local law enforcement.
Senator Hawley said, “Police departments across the country are under siege—underfunded, facing increased retirements, and struggling to make new hires. But as violence and rioting sweeps across American cities big and small, our courageous law enforcement officers are more vital now than ever. Democratic politicians are bending to radical activists who want to defund the police. We should do just the opposite. Our officers deserve a raise, not defunding. They deserve our unqualified support. And this bill would give it to them.”
Senator Hawley’s bill would allow recipients to use federal funds to increase the number of officers on their forces and raise the salaries of officers up to 110 percent of the local median earnings, and would exclude cities that defund their police.
David Dorn, a retired St. Louis Police captain, was killed on June 2, 2020, while protecting a friend’s store during a violent night of rioting in the city of St. Louis. He served for 38 years with the St. Louis Police Department.
Background
America’s law enforcement officers are under siege:
Police departments across the country face
increasing retirements and separation of officers, while they
struggle to hire new officers.
Many state and local law enforcement agencies report
decreasing morale among officers
as they face increasing violence and their work is vilified.
Police departments
struggle to pay officers
a salary commensurate with the challenging work as officers face increasing rioting and violence.
Meanwhile, in the face of growing crime, many liberal cities are threatening to “defund the police” and
slash law enforcement budgets.
To address these crises, the federal government must assist with the hiring and funding of additional police officers to protect our communities
The David Dorn Back the Blue Act
Authorizes $15 billion through the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement departments to boost their department personnel.
Provides funding for additional officer hires and officer retention for departments that need more manpower on their police forces.
Gives pay raises to officers by allowing recipients to use federal funds to raise the salaries of officers up to 110 percent of the local median earnings.
Excludes cities that defund their police by not allowing any department to receive money for pay raises that recently cut officer salaries.

Title: Sens. Hawley and Blumenthal Introduce Bipartisan Legislation To Fight Human Trafficking As Covid-19 Pandemic Worsens Crisis
Date: Friday, August 14, 2020

Content:
With human trafficking on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and introduced the bipartisan Leveraging Information on Foreign Traffickers (LIFT) Act to combat modern day slavery. This legislation supports survivor-centered efforts to monitor and prevent trafficking, and improves the U.S. Department of State’s ability to gather information on this crime. U.S. Representatives Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Eliot Engel (D-NY) are lead cosponsors of this bicameral legislation in the House and
introduced
the House version of the bill in January.
“Human trafficking, modern day slavery, is an evil that reaches into every corner of the world. We must fight until it is eradicated. This legislation equips the State Department and the survivor-led Advisory Council on Human Trafficking with new resources to monitor and combat trafficking wherever it exists.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“This bipartisan measure mobilizes survivors and better information to fight human trafficking,”
Senator Blumenthal said.
“It seeks to stop modern day slavery, even as the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating it. The increasing urgency of protecting innocent victims — before they are ensnared by traffickers — should make the LIFT Act a priority.”
Key provisions of the LIFT Act include:
Extending the Advisory Council on Human Trafficking (Council) by four years. The Council is a nongovernmental body that advises the State Department and other federal entities, and reviews federal efforts to monitor and prevent trafficking.
Authorizing Council members who are trafficking survivors to be compensated for their time.
Ensuring that the Trafficking in Persons Office at the State Department receives timely information on visa denials for reasons related to human trafficking to improve coordination and communication.
Extending the deadline for the federal government’s annual Trafficking in Persons Report from June 1 to June 30 to avoid straining the State Department’s resources.
The legislation has been endorsed by Humanity United and the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking (ATEST).
“The U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking is an important body consisting of survivors of human trafficking who advise the U.S. government on federal anti-trafficking policies and programs,”
said Humanity United Action Senior Advisor Corban Teague.
“It is critical that we elevate the voices of trafficking survivors and ensure they have a seat at the table. The bipartisan LIFT Act not only extends the authorization of the Advisory Council, but for the first time ever, will allow the survivors sitting on the Advisory Council to receive compensation for the work they do. This is a strong step in support of trafficking survivors, and Humanity United Action calls on Congress to swiftly pass this important legislation.”

Under Secretary for Nuclear Security & NNSA Administrator

Dear Secretary Brouillette and Under Secretary Gordon-Hagerty:
I write to draw your attention to a series of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” trainings—specifically, the “Full Diversity Partners Lab,” “White Men & Allies Learning Lab,” and “White Men’s Caucus” programs—paid for by Sandia National Laboratories and held at the “upscale” [
1
] La Posada de Santa Fe luxury hotel and resort. These trainings were conducted on July 10–13, 2018, July 21–August 1, 2019, September 3–6, 2019, and possibly on other occasions.
The reported content of these trainings is deeply disturbing. In a conscious attempt to avoid scrutiny of these workshops’ content, readers of the “White Men’s Caucus” workbook are advised that “[t]aken out of context, the notes and insights might be misleading” and accordingly “recommends that they be for the use of participants only.” But much of the content largely speaks for itself:
During the “White Men’s Caucus” program, it appears that attendees were required to engage in a free-association project about “white men.” Word associations included “MAGA hat,” “Aryan Nation,” “mass killings,” “can’t dance” and “no rhythm.”
During the “White Men’s Caucus,” participants were instructed to write messages “directed to white women, people of color and other groups regarding the meaning of this Caucus experience for you.”
During the “White Men & Allies Learning Lab,” participants were asked to generate a list of “assumptions about white women.” These assumptions included “better cooks,” “more emotional,” and “develop deeper emotional relationships so are not as technical as men.”
During the “White Men & Allies Learning Lab,” participants were asked to generate a list of “assumptions about people of color.” These assumptions included “have broken families,” “feel victimized,” and “buck authority.”
During the “White Men & Allies Learning Lab,” participants were asked to generate a list of examples of “male privilege,” which included “men can be strong enough to open jar lids” and “men can kill bugs more easily than ‘most’ women.”
I fail to see how this fixation on the crudest imaginable gender and race stereotypes is productive or worthy of the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. The focus on providing trainings specifically for “white men” is similarly concerning: while the race of the various participants in these workshops is not altogether clear, the use of overtly race-segregated diversity trainings would likely violate federal civil rights law.
It is also notable that Sandia workers’ participation in these trainings does not appear to have been voluntary: at the start of the “White Men’s Caucus” program, one anonymous participant noted his concern that the training was “freaking long” and that he would be missing his 10-year-old’s birthday in order to participate.
Finally, the Department has a responsibility to use federal taxpayers’ dollars prudently and responsibly. Outside DOE, significant amounts of federal money have already flowed to the organization behind the Sandia trainings, “White Men as Full Diversity Partners.” For its part, NASA has paid the group at least $36,000: almost $25,000 in 2011 for “building full diversity partnerships that include and engage white men,” [
2
] and just over $11,000 in 2013 for a program focused on “exploring the critical role of white men in building an inclusive work culture,” which lasted almost 7 months. [
3
] The Department of Defense paid the same organization almost $10,000 in 2018 for a “leadership engagement session.” [
4
]
In 2020, Sandia National Laboratories received $3.76 billion in federal government funding. [
5
]
The Department should immediately undertake a comprehensive review of its procedures and practices to ensure that taxpayers are no longer required to fund such divisive and ineffective trainings. Moreover, I request that the Department provide the following materials to my office—as well as to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs—no later than August 21, 2020:
An enumeration of all sums paid by any Department of Energy entity or affiliate to the organization “White Men as Full Diversity Partners” and any other diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training groups.
Copies of all DEI materials used to train the employees of Department of Energy entities or affiliates.
The dates of all DEI trainings conducted by outside organizations for the employees of Department of Energy entities or affiliates.
I look forward to receiving your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley’s Bill to Ban TikTok on Government Devices Passes Senate Unanimously
Date: Thursday, August 06, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bill to ban TikTok on government devices unanimously passed the Senate. Senator Hawley’s bill, introduced with Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.), would follow up on steps already taken by the State Department, the
Department of Homeland Security, the
Department of Defense, and
TSA
to ban the app on federal government devices due to security concerns.
“In light of all we know, it is unthinkable to me that we should continue to permit federal employees, those workers entrusted with sensitive government data, to access this app on their work phones and computers,”
said Senator Hawley. “I’m encouraged by the bipartisan support we have seen in this body to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and that includes, by the way, holding accountable those corporations who would just do China’s bidding. And, if I have anything to say about it, we won’t be stopping here.”
Joining the bill as cosponsors were Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Kennedy (R-La.), and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.). In August, the House of Representatives
voted in favor of companion legislation
introduced by Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Microsoft Sever All Ties to ByteDance, CCP in Potential TikTok Acquisition
Date: Wednesday, August 05, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella demanding that TikTok sever any and all ties to ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in any potential acquisition by Microsoft. Senator Hawley writes that there have been a number of recent conflicting reports about Microsoft’s plans and it is not clear whether the app will include vulnerabilities that allow the CCP to access American users’ data.
“It is not clear whether Microsoft is moving toward a partnership with ByteDance to continue offering the app in the United States, or whether Microsoft will be taking full and independent control of the app and its data,”
writes Senator Hawley.
“Let me be clear: Any resolution of the TikTok investigation that fails to sever all links between TikTok and potential proxies for the Chinese Communist Party, including but not limited to ByteDance, is unacceptable.”
Senator Hawley requests Microsoft explain what steps they plan to take to ensure the app is not covertly sending user data to Chinese stakeholders, how they anticipate using user data, and make the identities of any co-investors known to Congress to conduct oversight of the deal.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
August 5, 2020
Satya Nadella
CEO
Microsoft Corporation
One Microsoft Way
Redmond, WA 98052
Dear Mr. Nadella:
Over the last few days, there have been a number of conflicting reports in the press about how exactly Microsoft hopes to take control of the popular TikTok app.
To name just a few examples: The New York Times reported on July 31 that “non-Chinese investors like Sequoia Capital, SoftBank and General Atlantic could purchase a majority stake in the app from ByteDance.”
[
1
]
An August 2 post on the Official Microsoft Blog stated that current proposals “would involve a purchase of the TikTok service in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and would result in Microsoft owning and operating TikTok in these markets” and noted that “Microsoft may invite other American investors to participate on a minority basis in this purchase.”
[
2
]
Protocol reported on August 3 that your company is seeking a deal that would “cut[] off all ties between Bytedance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, and the app itself.”
[
3
]
And a ByteDance internal employee letter circulated on the same day stated that “CFIUS determined that ByteDance must fully divest TikTok’s US operations” and that ByteDance has “initiated preliminary discussions with a tech company to help clear the way for [ByteDance] to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.”
[
4
]
Based on these reports, it is not clear whether Microsoft is moving toward a partnership with ByteDance to continue offering the app in the United States, or whether Microsoft will be taking full and independent control of the app and its data. It is not clear whether the code Microsoft plans to offer in the United States might include potential vulnerabilities that would allow the Chinese government continued access to U.S. users’ data subsequent to any divestment. It is not clear whether the new entity’s operations will be run by former Bytedance engineers who answer to the Chinese government. It is not even clear whether the Chinese Communist Party and proxies like Bytedance will be allowed to profit from the final settlement of this inquiry.
Let me be clear: Any resolution of the TikTok investigation that fails to sever all links between TikTok and potential proxies for the Chinese Communist Party, including but not limited to ByteDance, is unacceptable.
I have a number of questions about the proposed details of such an ownership transfer that will inform my view as to whether any acceptable divestment of TikTok’s assets to Microsoft is even possible:
If there are co-investors, what steps will Microsoft take to ensure that such partners’ interests will not conflict with Microsoft’s efforts to wall off TikTok from Chinese influence? When will Microsoft disclose the identities of these co-investors, and will said investors make themselves available to Congress so that we can conduct appropriate oversight of this deal?
In the short term, what steps will Microsoft take to review the TikTok app code to ensure that the app is not sending user data, overtly or covertly, to Chinese stakeholders?
What connection aside from branding will the American version of TikTok have with the Chinese version? Will the users of one of the two applications have access to videos from the other? If so, will popular Chinese TikTok videos, potentially promoted by the Chinese Communist Party itself, be promoted to U.S. users?
Assuming all U.S. user data will be stored on U.S. soil, who will have access to this data? Will ByteDance’s technical team, or other engineers potentially affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, be involved with transferring user data over to your company or in the company’s ongoing operations after such transfer? If so, how can Microsoft possibly ensure that backdoors are not being implemented behind the scenes on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party?
How does Microsoft anticipate using TikTok user data? Does Microsoft plan a greater emphasis in the future on consumer advertising? What steps will Microsoft take to ensure that the underage userbase of this application is not exploited?
What steps will Microsoft take to ensure that no TikTok user data or inferences and analytics derived from such data are transferred, whether intentionally or intentionally, to or through Microsoft’s large-scale data operations in China?
[
5
]
If Microsoft plans on training its artificial intelligence systems on TikTok data, how can any such separation even be possible?
Given the Chinese Communist Party’s past efforts to censor content shared on TikTok, will Microsoft develop new terms of service regarding content moderation? If so, how does Microsoft plan to avoid the concerns about political censorship that have plagued other American social media applications?
Will Bytedance be allowed to profit from the proposed acquisition?
Will the United States government receive an appropriate share of the acquisition cost?
Thank you for your attention to these matters.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley Calls for a “Cleaning of House” at DOJ, FBI Over Russiagate Revelations
Date: Wednesday, August 05, 2020

Content:
Today, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing regarding former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates’s role in the FBI’s investigation into President Donald Trump’s campaign, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called for a cleaning of house at the FBI and Department of Justice over misleading FISA applications that led to the surveillance of Carter Page, which Yates admitted she now regrets having approved. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) objected to his remarks, calling them “inflammatory.”
Senator Hawley replied, “With all due respect, we have a deliberate and systematic misleading of a federal court here. I don’t think you can say anything more inflammatory than what the federal court itself said when they issued an incredible statement I’ve never seen a federal court, let alone the FISA court, issue, saying that they now had no confidence in any of the submissions at the FBI based on the level of lying.”

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal Call for DOJ Investigation into Zoom, TikTok
Date: Thursday, July 30, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers calling for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to open an investigation into Zoom and TikTok for reported violations of Americans’ civil liberties and of their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
“Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government,”
the Senators said.
“As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government. Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming – Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China’s state security services.”
The Senators continued,
“Both Zoom and TikTok have failed to answer even basic questions about their business operations, including who has access to personal information and when they comply with request from China or other governments. We believe that it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok’s business relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to Americans.”
The full letter is available
here
and below.
The Honorable John C. Demers
Assistant Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530-0001
Assistant Attorney General Demers:
We are writing to urge the Department of Justice to open an investigation into reported violations of Americans’ civil liberties by Zoom and TikTok and the national security implications of both companies’ relationships with the People’s Republic of China. Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government.
As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government. Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming – Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China’s state security services. Even when subsidiaries, product teams, or servers are located outside of the country, when their engineers or management are based in China, sensitive personal data is still within the reach of Chinese intelligence.
By hiding vulnerable ties and dependencies on China, Zoom and TikTok have obscured from American consumers that their personal data could be at risk. While Zoom is headquartered in the United States, the research group Citizen Lab found that the Zoom application appears to be developed by three companies in China, including at least 700 employees in China that work in “research and development.”[1]Similarly, although TikTok has claimed to be based in the United States or Cayman Islands, it is owned by a Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance. Moreover, although TikTok is quick to claim that the app does not work in China, it is slower to highlight the fact that Bytedance operates a sibling app in China that exactly mirrors TikTok. This naturally raises questions concerning TikTok’s other claims of independence from China and calls into question who is actually running the app.
Zoom and TikTok also share a recurring and disturbing history of complying with demands by the Chinese Communist Party and silencing criticism of the Chinese government. Although the United States has long prided itself on being a safe haven for dissidents and human rights activists escaping repressive regimes, we are profoundly concerned that both companies could pose a threat to the safety of Americans, their families, and brave activists inside of China working with U.S.-based dissidents.
For example, in early June, several Chinese pro-democracy advocates, including a prominent dissident based in the United States, were suspended by Zoom following a demand from the Chinese Communist Party because they had held a peaceful commemoration of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations on Zoom.[2] In addition to being a chilling case of censorship within the United States, Zoom has still failed to answer whether it turned over information about those attending that meeting to the Chinese government. Such disclosures of sensitive information concerning that meeting, and other similar events like online church services, could be a death sentence for vulnerable communities inside of China.
Despite repeated promises of transparency and multiple inquiries from Congress, both Zoom and TikTok have failed to answer even basic questions about their business operations, including who has access to personal information and when they comply with request from China or other governments. We believe that it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok’s business relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to Americans. In addition to opening an investigation, we request that the Department of Justice and its partners in the Intelligence Community provide a briefing to Congress on this issue as soon as possible.
We appreciate your consideration of this request.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Bill to Remove Section 230 Immunity from Behavioral Advertisers
Date: Tuesday, July 28, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced he will introduce the
Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act, a bill to remove Section 230 immunity from Big Tech companies that display manipulative, behavioral ads or provide data to be used for them. Senator Hawley’s bill would crack down on behavioral advertising’s negative effects, which include invasive data collection and user manipulation through design choices.
Senator Hawley said,
“Big Tech’s manipulative advertising regime comes with a massive hidden price tag for consumers while providing almost no return to anyone but themselves. From privacy violations to harming children to suppression of speech, the ramifications are very real. These kinds of manipulative ads are not what Congress had in mind when passing Section 230, and now is the time to put a stop to this abuse.”
Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook track users, without their consent, to create psychological profiles, which are then used to deliver individually targeted ads. When Congress passed Section 230 a quarter-century ago, legislators could never have imagined the extent of behavioral advertisers’ surveillance and power.
Senator Hawley has been a leading critic of Section 230’s protection of Big Tech firms and
recently called for
Twitter to lose immunity if it chooses to editorialize on political speech.

Title: Senator Hawley, Congressman Smith Introduce U.S. Military Right to Carry Act
Date: Thursday, July 23, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Congressman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to ease the burden active duty military servicemembers face when renewing concealed-carry licenses while stationed outside of their state of residency. The
U.S. Military Right to Carry Act
allows servicemembers to renew their permits by mail and requires states to treat members of the military equally to state residents in issuing concealed carry permits.
“The military men and women who serve our country shouldn’t face endless red tape in order to exercise their constitutional right to carry firearms and maintain their concealed carry licenses. I’m proud to stand up for our service members and for their Second Amendment rights with this legislation.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“The brave men and women of the United States military should not face any discrimination when it comes to their concealed carry permits,”
said Congressman Smith. “If a member of the U.S. Armed Forces holds a concealed carry permit, they should be able to renew that permit by mail or be treated as a resident of the state in which they are stationed. My bill is a critical step in ensuring the constitutional rights of our military members are protected regardless of where they’re stationed, allowing them to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Background
Active duty servicemembers on orders outside of their home states often face difficulties maintaining their concealed-carry licenses or obtaining them because of in-person or state-resident-only requirements. Many states require concealed-carry license renewals through in-person appointments, creating bureaucratic barriers for military personnel who may be stationed elsewhere. Additionally, states often require residency in the state to permit concealed-carry licenses, so servicemembers who regularly move around to different duty stations may have difficulty obtaining concealed-carry weapon licenses.
The U.S. Military Right to Carry Act
Provides active duty servicemembers the option to renew concealed-carry weapon licenses by mail in their state of residency;
Requires state governments to implement a law to consider active duty servicemembers as residents of the state for purposes of issuing a permit to carry a concealed firearm in that state; and
Reduces a state’s federal grant funding if it refuses to offer military members these options for concealed carry licenses.

Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) challenged corporate America and celebrities that hawk their products to pledge that they do not rely on slave labor for production. Senator Hawley

Title: Sen. Hawley to Introduce Bill to Hold Corporate America Accountable for Having Slave Labor in Supply Chains
Date: Monday, July 20, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is introducing legislation to hold American companies accountable for slave labor in their supply chains.
The Slave-Free Business Certification Act
(S. 4241) increases corporate supply chain disclosure requirements, mandates regular audits, requires Chief Executive Officers to certify that their companies’ supply chains do not rely on forced, slave labor, and creates penalties for firms that fail basic minimum standards for human rights.
Senator Hawley said, “Corporate America and the celebrities that hawk their products have been playing this game for a long time – talk up corporate social responsibility and social justice at home while making millions of dollars off the slave labor that assembles their products. Executives build woke, progressive brands for American consumers, but happily outsource labor to Chinese concentration camps, all just to save a few bucks.
“If corporate America wants to be the face of social change today, they should have to certify they are completely slave-free. Participate in independent audits to verify it and disclose steps to ensure slave labor won’t become part of the equation later on. And if they refuse to do so, they should pay the price. That’s social responsibility.”
At least 80 global companies have been tied to forced Uyghur labor in China, from sportswear companies like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to tech giants like Lenovo and Samsung. These issues extend beyond China. For example, Starbucks and Nespresso rely on underpaid Brazilian laborers who are denied basic necessities like food and water.
The Slave-Free Business Certification Act
Compels companies to disclose the steps they are taking to eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking from their supply chains
Directs major companies to undergo independent audits to ensure they are not complicit in forced labor and trafficking in their supply chains
Mandates public reports to the Department of Labor on the results of their independent audits
Requires CEOs to certify that their supply chains are free from slave labor or that they have reported all instances of forced labor in their companies

Title: Senator Hawley Requests Smithsonian Explain Controversial “Talking About Race” Initiative
Date: Monday, July 20, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Smithsonian Museum Secretary Lonnie Bunch requesting he explain the museum’s “Talking About Race” initiative, which until recently featured material claiming “the nuclear family,” “self-reliance,” and “objective, rational linear thinking” are distinctly white traits emblematic of structural racism. Senator Hawley requests that Secretary Bunch explain the Smithsonian’s intent in promoting these materials.
Senator Hawley wrote, “The claim that these qualities and commitments – ideas Americans of all races have traditionally celebrated and strived to teach to their children – are distinctive to white Americans would be troubling enough given its implication that they are foreign to Americans of color. However, the position of the Smithsonian, as suggested by the materials prior to their removal, appeared to be even more troubling: that these attributes are actually emblems of ‘structural racism’ in American life to be rejected rather than embraced.”

here
or below.
July 17, 2020
Lonnie G. Bunch III
Secretary
The Smithsonian
600 Maryland Avenue SW
Washington, DC 20002
Dear Secretary Bunch:
I write to you to request information about the Smithsonian’s recent “Talking About Race” initiative.
The “Talking About Race” website claims the material is meant to provide an “opportunity to engage in thoughtful, respectful, and productive conversations” about race in America. However, the materials published under this initiative – some of which have recently been removed after public scrutiny – appear to embrace ideas likelier to foment racial division than mutual respect and understanding. Included in the recently deleted materials were assertions that white culture, as distinct from the cultures of other races in America, is defined by commitment to the following ideas:
“Self-reliance”
“The nuclear family”
“Objective, rational linear thinking”
“Hard work is the key to success”
“Plan for the future”
“Quantitative emphasis”
“Intent counts”
“Be polite”
The claim that these qualities and commitments – ideas Americans of all races have traditionally celebrated and strived to teach to their children – are distinctive to white Americans would be troubling enough given its implication that they are foreign to Americans of color. However, the position of the Smithsonian, as suggested by the materials prior to their removal, appeared to be even more troubling: that these attributes are actually emblems of “structural racism” in American life to be rejected rather than embraced.
For reasons that remain unclear, much of this material appeared to be quoted verbatim from controversial educational materials dating back to 1990 that the Smithsonian cited uncritically. Other content quotes approvingly from the work of Robin DiAngelo, a controversial author whose book White Fragility is recommended as further reading by the Smithsonian. I am curious as to the manner in which the Smithsonian sourced these materials given the wide range of opinion and scholarship that would reject the assertions of the exhibit about the ostensibly racial distinctiveness of characteristics more commonly understood to have nothing to do with race.
I am pleased that the Smithsonian has removed some of the most offensive content from the “Talking About Race” website. I urge you to conduct a full review of this initiative to remove similarly concerning content and to review the process by which this material escaped the review of your leadership team.
Additionally, please respond to the following questions by next Wednesday, July 22:
Why did the Smithsonian suggest that self-reliance, the nuclear family, objective and rational thinking, hard work, planning, quantitative emphasis, concern about intent, and politeness are distinctly “white” qualities? Did the Smithsonian mean to suggest that Americans of color are deficient in such qualities, and that anti-racist efforts necessarily entail a rejection of these qualities?
Does the Smithsonian believe the nuclear family to be a construct of white supremacy that should be deemphasized? Please elaborate on what the nuclear family’s presence in these materials was meant to suggest.
Why did the Smithsonian suggest that white people believe “wealth is worth” and “bland is best,” that white people are uniquely capable of “decision-making,” and that white people are characterized by a drive to “master and control nature?”
How many senior leaders at the Smithsonian reviewed these materials before their publication, and how did they pass through the Smithsonian’s approval process? Please identify any such senior leaders.
Did you review these materials yourself prior to writing in Smithsonian Magazine that though this initiative “we are helping audiences better understand our differences and bridge the chasm of race,” and do you condone the assertions made within them?
Does the Smithsonian agree with the proposition at the heart of the American way of life that “all men are created equal?” Does the institution agree with the timeless principle espoused by Dr. King that people should “not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character?”
Finally, please identify this material’s connection to The Atlantic Philanthropies and any payments made to Robin DiAngelo or other scholars referenced in this exhibit in the form of consulting, speaking, or licensing fees, as well as any forthcoming programming involving such individuals.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Release Plan to Hold Chinese Communist Party Responsible for Coronavirus Pandemic
Date: Monday, July 20, 2020

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and a group of colleagues joined Senator Martha McSally in introducing the
Civil Justice for Victims of China-Originated Viral Infectious Diseases (COVID) Act
to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) responsible for the coronavirus global pandemic. The bill incorporates previous stand-alone bills introduced separately by
Senator Hawley,
Senator McSally and Blackburn, and
Senator Cotton
to hold the CCP accountable.
“I’m proud to stand with my colleagues and lead the effort to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the devastation they have unleashed on the world. This pandemic is far from over, and every day Americans continue to suffer thanks to the CCP’s incompetence and lies. The victims deserve to have their day in court.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator McSally said,
“Americans who have been victimized by the lies and deceit of the Chinese Communist Party—to include those who lost loved ones, suffered business losses, or were personally harmed due to COVID-19—deserve the opportunity to hold China accountable and to demand just compensation. Our bill will empower Americans to do just that by providing them with the legal tools necessary to sue the Chinese government in federal court for creating and worsening the COVID-19 pandemic. As the death toll and financial losses of COVID-19 mount, China should be forced to pay the costs of these damages to the American people.”
The COVID Act would strip China of its sovereign immunity and create a cause of action against China for causing the coronavirus pandemic through its reckless actions and lies. The plan would also authorize federal courts to freeze Chinese assets and allow States to sue on their own behalf or on behalf of their residents. Joining the bill as original cosponsors are Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).
Senator Hawley has been
a leading advocate
to hold China accountable for the coronavirus in U.S. courts and was
threatened with countermeasures by the Chinese government
as a result of his efforts.

Title: Senator Hawley Requests Twitter Clarify Employee’s Involvement in Cyberattack and New Questions About Moderation Practices
Date: Friday, July 17, 2020

Content:
Today Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey requesting he respond to
reports that a Twitter employee
was involved in Wednesday’s cyberattack and, if true, when Twitter became aware of this fact. Senator Hawley also asked Dorsey to explain screenshots seeming to indicate Twitter engages in “shadowbanning” users and whether these tools have ever been applied to an elected official.
Within an hour of Wednesday’s hacking incident, Senator Hawley had
sent a letter
to Dorsey calling for Twitter to immediately cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies to respond to secure the site.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
July 17, 2020
Jack Dorsey
Chief Executive Officer
Twitter
355 Market Street, Suite 900
San Francisco, CA 94103
Dear Mr. Dorsey,
Shortly after I wrote to you about Wednesday’s breach of Twitter’s security, Twitter announced its detection of a “coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”
Contrary to this account, press reports suggest that the employees in question may not have been mere victims. According to Vice, sources in the hacking community claim that the Twitter employee involved may have been paid to facilitate this breach.
These reports also indicate that screenshots of Twitter’s internal tools have been circulating within the hacking community. One such screenshot indicates that Twitter employs tools allowing it to append “Search Blacklist,” “Trends Blacklist,” “Bounced,” and “ReadOnly” flags to user accounts. Given your insistence in testimony to Congress that Twitter does not engage in politically biased “shadowbanning” and the public interest in Twitter’s moderation practices, it is notable that Twitter reportedly suspended user accounts sharing screenshots of this panel.
In addition to the questions I submitted earlier this week, please respond promptly to the following questions:
To your knowledge, did any Twitter employee voluntarily participate in or facilitate Wednesday’s incident?
If so, was Twitter aware of the possibility of the employee’s voluntary involvement at the time that it publicly claimed knowledge of a “coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees?”
Did you participate in discussions about the company’s public disclosures about this incident during which any participants considered downplaying Twitter employees’ complicity in this incident? Are you aware of any such conversations taking place, whether or not you were directly involved?
What steps does Twitter take to prevent any single employee from obtaining improper access to the accounts of its entire userbase? Has Twitter considered and decided against implementing more stringent access control measures in the past? If so, why?
Please define the terms “Search Blacklist,” “Trends Blacklist,” “Bounced,” and “ReadOnly.” Please also explain, for each term, whether such flags on user accounts affect the visibility of tweets within users’ timelines.
Does Twitter indicate to users affected by these flags or other similar measures that reduce user reach that their accounts or tweets have been flagged in such a manner? If not, why not?
Have any of these flags, or other flags with similar functions limiting the visibility of user tweets, ever been applied to the account or tweets of President Trump or other U.S. elected officials? If so, please include a record of each such flag.
Please explain the rules that Twitter uses to implement such flags on user accounts and tweets and the process by which Twitter ensures that such implementation is not conducted in a politically biased manner. As you no doubt recall, you have testified to Congress that “We believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially. We do not shadowban anyone based on political ideology.” This statement indicates that your use of these internal systems is governed by “rules” rather than mere discretion.
I understand that Twitter removed some screenshots of these internal systems Wednesday because they included private user information. Did Twitter remove any screenshots that had been redacted to remove such information or ban any accounts sharing such screenshots? If so, given the public interest in this matter, why did Twitter take such action? Was any consideration given in making such a decision to the possibility that such screenshots would subject Twitter’s content moderation practices to greater scrutiny?
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for Federal Civil Rights Investigation into STL Circuit Attorney’s Targeting of McCloskey Family
Date: Thursday, July 16, 2020

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General William Barr calling for a federal civil rights investigation into St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s targeting of the McCloskey family for using firearms to defend themselves and their property against a mob of protestors. Senator Hawley writes that Gardner has abused her power in seizing the McCloskey’s guns, investigating the family, and pursuing a possible indictment of the McCloskeys.
Senator Hawley writes,
“This is an unacceptable abuse of power and threat to the Second Amendment, and I urge you to consider a federal civil rights investigation into the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office to determine whether this investigation and impending prosecution violates this family’s constitutional rights. There is no question under Missouri law that the McCloskeys had the right to own and use their firearms to protect themselves from threatened violence, and that any criminal prosecution for these actions is legally unsound. The only possible motivation for the investigation, then, is a politically motivated attempt to punish this family for exercising their Second Amendment rights.”

William P. Barr
Attorney General of the United States
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
As you are well aware, the country is facing a moment of significant public unrest and discord. As many Americans are peacefully exercising their constitutional rights to free speech and protest throughout the country, still others are exploiting this moment as an opportunity to sow violence and destruction. Too often, peaceful demonstrations have devolved into tense standoffs or violent riots, with threats and attacks on businesses, innocent bystanders, and law enforcement officers.
One such incident occurred in St. Louis, Missouri, where a family reportedly faced a mass of demonstrators trespassing on their property and threatening them. When help from the police or from nearby security failed to arrive, this family, the McCloskeys, did what any reasonable person would do: they retrieved their lawfully owned firearms and defended their property and their lives. The confrontation was resolved with no one being hurt.
Unfortunately, this family is facing new threats, not from demonstrators but from the local government. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner is now threatening to prosecute not the trespassers, but the McCloskeys, and she is using the powers of her office to target them. Her office has seized their firearms, and police have applied for warrants in the case, with an indictment believed to be imminent. [

]
This is an unacceptable abuse of power and threat to the Second Amendment, and I urge you to consider a federal civil rights investigation into the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office to determine whether this investigation and impending prosecution violates this family’s constitutional rights. There is no question under Missouri law that the McCloskeys had the right to own and use their firearms to protect themselves from threatened violence, and that any criminal prosecution for these actions is legally unsound. The only possible motivation for the investigation, then, is a politically motivated attempt to punish this family for exercising their Second Amendment rights. Indeed, this is part of a troubling pattern of politically motivated prosecutorial decisions by the St. Louis Circuit Attorney, who has not seen fit to prosecute many violent offenders, [
2
] and who has expressed hostility to gun rights in the past. [
3
] Recently, she declined to pursue charges against twenty-nine individuals arrested during a weekend of riots in the city, and charged only seven. [
4
]
The Second Amendment is not a second-class right. No family should face the threat of harassment or malicious prosecution for exercising that right. The Department of Justice must ensure that all Americans’ rights are protected from this kind of abuse of power.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Following a massive Twitter cyberattack during which countless accounts were hacked, including those of former President Barack Obama and presidential nominee Joe Biden, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey requesting he immediately reach out to the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to take any necessary measures to secure the site.
Senator Hawley writes, “I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself. As you know, millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service. A successful attack on your system’s servers represents a threat to all of your users’ privacy and data security.”

Jack Dorsey
Chief Executive Officer
Twitter
355 Market Street, Suite 900
San Francisco, CA 94103
Dear Mr. Dorsey,
As I write, Twitter seems to be experiencing a large-scale cyberattack, as illustrated by a number of posts inviting users to transfer Bitcoin under fraudulent pretenses. The accounts targeted include those for Apple, Uber, Jeff Bezos, former President Barack Obama, and even the Democratic nominee for President. The list of affected accounts is growing by the minute. Some affected accounts are alleged to have been protected by Twitter’s two factor authentication.
I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself. As you know, millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service. A successful attack on your system’s servers represents a threat to all of your users’ privacy and data security.
Please reach out immediately to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and take any necessary measures to secure the site before this breach expands. Once you have attended to immediate concerns, please respond to following questions:
Did this event represent a breach of users’ own account security or of Twitter’s systems?
Were accounts protected by two-factor authentication successfully targeted in this breach? If so, how was this possible?
Did this breach compromise the account security of users whose accounts were not used to share fraudulent posts? If so, how many accounts were affected? Were all accounts’ security compromised by this breach?
How many users may have faced data theft as a consequence of this breach?
What measures does Twitter undertake to prevent system-level hacks from breaching the security of its entire userbase?
Did this attack threaten the security of the president’s own Twitter account?

Title: Senator Hawley Blasts NBA for Kowtowing to Beijing & Refusing to Support U.S. Military and Law Enforcement
Date: Friday, July 10, 2020

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is sending a
letter
to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver blasting the league’s apparent decision to strictly limit messages players can wear on their jerseys to a few pre-approved, social justice slogans while censoring support for law enforcement officers or the military and any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Senator Hawley writes that, as the NBA is now sanctioning political messages, they must stand up for American values and make clear where they stand on China’s human rights abuses.
Senator Hawley writes, “The truth is that your decisions about which messages to allow and which to censor – much like the censorship decisions of the CCP – are themselves statements about your association’s values. If I am right – if the NBA is more committed to promoting the CCP’s interests than to celebrating its home nation – your fans deserve to know that is your view. If not, prove me wrong. Let your players stand up for the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. Let them stand up for American law enforcement if they so choose. Give them the choice to write ‘Back the Blue’ on their jerseys. Or ‘Support our Troops.’ Maybe ‘God Bless America.’ What could be more American than that?”
In October 2019, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to Commissioner Silver criticizing the league’s decision to side with the CCP over pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Commissioner Silver
recently described
the incident as “a bump in the road” in the NBA’s relationship with the Chinese government and said he hopes to “find mutual respect” with the CCP.
Senator Hawley requests that Commissioner Silver clarify whether the NBA will censor players who choose a message in support of victims of the CCP, how they plan to respond to potential CCP retaliation, and whether they will allow players to display messages in support of the U.S. military and law enforcement.

or below.
July 10, 2020
Adam Silver
Commissioner
National Basketball Association
645 5th Avenue
New York, NY 10022
Dear Mr. Silver,
On July 3, the National Basketball Association (NBA) came to an agreement with the NBA players union allowing players to wear certain social and political messages on their jerseys, almost all aligned with the message of recent anti-police protests. Conspicuously missing from the list of approved phrases are any in support of the victims of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including the people of Hong Kong, whose remaining freedoms are being extinguished by the CCP’s newly-enacted national security law.
Given the NBA’s troubled history of excusing and apologizing for the brutal repression of the Chinese Communist regime, these omissions are striking. Last October, you no doubt recall, you chose to apologize to the CCP after Daryl Morey, General Manager of the Houston Rockets, spoke up on behalf of the Hong Kong protestors.
Following that shameful display, I encouraged you to reverse course. Instead, you have spent the intervening months deepening the NBA’s ties to the CCP. Just last week, you described the October incident as “a bump in the road” in the NBA’s relationship with the Chinese government. You went on to say that you understand that the CCP has “a different view of … how things should be done,” and that you hope the NBA and the CCP will be able to “find mutual respect for each other.”
What offensive nonsense. No amount of profit can justify collaborating with a regime for which violent suppression and enslavement are routine tools of governance.
The league’s new policy suggests a newfound commitment to enhanced employee expression. But that free expression appears to stop at the edge of your corporate sponsors’ sensibilities. And for woke capital today, profits from the Chinese market are more popular than patriotism.
The truth is that your decisions about which messages to allow and which to censor – much like the censorship decisions of the CCP – are themselves statements about your association’s values. If I am right – if the NBA is more committed to promoting the CCP’s interests than to celebrating its home nation – your fans deserve to know that is your view. If not, prove me wrong. Let your players stand up for the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. Let them stand up for American law enforcement if they so choose. Give them the choice to write “Back the Blue” on their jerseys. Or “Support our Troops.” Maybe “God Bless America.” What could be more American than that?
With your new policy, you have crossed the line of sanctioning specific political messages. There is no avoiding the work of clarifying the association’s values now. This is a time for you to make clear what your league believes about human rights and about the nation that is your home. Your silence on these questions speaks volumes.
With that in mind, I request your response to the following questions by July 29, 2020:
Is the NBA prepared to allow its players to wear phrases in support of the United States, the American military, and U.S. law enforcement personnel, such as “God Bless America,” “Support Our Troops,” or “Back the Blue”? Will it censor players wearing such messages on their jerseys?
Are public reports correct that the list of phrases approved for display on NBA players’ jerseys does not include messages in support of victims of the Chinese Communist Party?
If a player chooses to display a message of support for victims of the Chinese Community Party on their jersey, will the NBA allow the player to wear their jersey or will it censor that player in order to avoid drawing Beijing’s ire?
How does the NBA plan to defend NBA players and employees against retaliation by the Chinese Communist Party if they choose to speak out against the Party’s actions in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, or elsewhere?
Is the NBA prepared to publicly condemn any attempt by the Chinese Communist Party to silence or punish these individuals?
I look forward to your answers. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Direct a Commission to work closely with state and local stakeholders to nominate installation names or other references to the Confederacy for removal from DoD installations, including by holding public hearings on any proposed criteria or recommendations for removal.
Require the Commission to report to Congress on its efforts, so that Congress can ensure state and local input is substantially reflected in the Commission’s final recommendations.

Title: U.S. Senate Passes Senator Hawley’s Resolution Condemning Beijing’s Proposed Takeover of Hong Kong

Today the United States Senate passed
Senate Resolution 596, introduced by Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s proposed “national security law” for Hong Kong that would ban secession, subversion, and foreign interference. Senator Hawley’s resolution says passage of CCP’s proposed law would put Beijing in direct violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law and calls upon all free nations to stand against the  campaign to destroy Hongkongers’ basic liberties and human rights.
Speaking on the Senate Floor, Senator Hawley said, “I just want to say to the people of Hong Kong, who I’ve had the privilege to meet and to be with them on the streets as they protest, as they stand up to this violent and authoritarian regime, I hope that today’s actions will give you an added measure of hope that the free people of this nation and the free people of the world are with you and that we will not sit idly by, that we will stand up, that we will take action, and that your cause for your basic rights, your cause for your basic liberties, is our cause as well. It’s a privilege to stand with you as an American and as a Missourian and it’s a privilege to see this work accomplished today on the floor of the Senate.”
Senator Hawley’s resolution was cosponsored by Senators Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and John Boozman (R-Ark.).

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces NDAA Amendment to Resist Left-Wing Assault on History
Date: Wednesday, June 24, 2020

Content:
As rioters across the country deface and tear down historic American and religious landmarks, Senator Josh Hawley is introducing an
amendment
to block an effort by Senator Elizabeth Warren to unilaterally mandate that the Department of Defense rename military bases and remove war memorials to the fallen. Senator Warren’s provision in the
National Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) mandates that all military bases referencing Confederate officers must be renamed. Senator Hawley’s amendment eliminates the mandate and instead tasks a Commission to hold public hearings, gather input from military families and veterans, and work with state and local communities to recommend a way forward.
In recent weeks, rioters camped outside the White House have defaced St. John’s Episcopal Church, attempted to tear down a statue of former President Andrew Jackson, torn down the statues of George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, and even torn down a statue of a Catholic missionary St. Junipero Serra.
“This latest effort to unilaterally rename bases and remove war memorials, all behind closed doors, smacks of the cancel culture the Left wants to impose on the nation. Any discussion about renaming bases should be had in the light of day, out in the open, and it should involve military families, veterans, and state and local stakeholders. That’s what my amendment would do.
Senator Josh Hawley
“The reality though is that this was never about the Confederacy. That’s what left-wing activists want us to believe. The events of the last few weeks where rioters have attacked American and religious landmarks tell us otherwise. It only took days for them to move on to Grant and Lincoln. And the mob will keep marching through all our cultural institutions until every American whom the woke crowd deems unjust is cancelled.”
The
Hawley Amendment
will:
Remove language requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to rename military installations that are named after Confederate officers.
Direct a Commission to work closely with state and local stakeholders to nominate installation names or other references to the Confederacy for removal from DoD installations, including by holding public hearings on any proposed criteria or recommendations for removal.
Require the Commission to report to Congress on its efforts, so that Congress can ensure state and local input is substantially reflected in the Commission’s final recommendations.

Title: Senator Hawley Announces Bill Empowering Americans to Sue Big Tech Companies Acting in Bad Faith
Date: Wednesday, June 17, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced a bill
to empower Americans to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech and hiding content created by their competitors. Cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.),  Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) Senator Hawley’s bill would prohibit Big Tech companies from receiving Section 230 immunity unless they update their terms of service to promise to operate in good faith and pay a $5,000 fine (or actual damages, if higher) plus attorney’s fees if they violate that promise.
“For too long, Big Tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users. Section 230 has been stretched and rewritten by courts to give these companies outlandish power over speech without accountability. Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Rubio said, “Recent actions by Big Tech call into question the legal immunities that social media companies enjoy under Section 230 and whether these firms live up to their obligations. It is time to take a fresh look at the statute and clarify the vague standard of ‘good faith’ for which technology companies receive legal protections. That is exactly what this bill does. While Section 230 serves an important purpose, it should not protect unrelated activities such as censorship and political activism.”
Background
The
Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act
provides that Big Tech companies who want to receive section 230 immunity must bind themselves contractually to a duty of good faith.
Under this bill:
Users could sue the major Big Tech companies for breaching their contractual duty of good faith;
The duty of good faith would contractually prohibit Big Tech from:
Discriminating when enforcing the terms of service they write (just like police and prosecutors are not supposed to discriminate when enforcing the law);
Failing to honor their promises;
Big Tech companies who breach their duty of good faith would have to pay $5,000 or actual damages, whichever is higher, plus attorney’s fees to each user who prevails.

Title: Senator Hawley Blasts Google for Threatening Conservative Outlets and Section 230 Hypocrisy
Date: Wednesday, June 17, 2020

Content:
Following reports
that Google threatened to demonetize The Federalist based on its comments section, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Google CEO Sundar Pichai blasting the company for political censorship. Senator Hawley writes that Google is aware of its dominance in online advertising and, based on information provided by foreign dark-money groups, is attempting to use that power to target conservative outlets and dissenting voices.
Senator Hawley writes, “Moreover, it is profoundly disingenuous for Google to insist on applying a standard to other companies that it disclaims for itself. Google and other technology companies routinely rely on the protections afforded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to evade responsibility for any third-party content posted on the platforms they offer. Now, Google apparently declines to extend a similar protection to those companies that rely on its own services. And the hypocrisy does not stop there: if the contents of a website’s comments sections are sufficient to declare that site offensive and banish it from Google’s platform, one wonders what to make of the cesspit that is the comments section of YouTube. In short, Google demands minimum oversight for itself, but maximum power over those who use its platform.”

Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google, LLC
1600 Amphitheater Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
Google’s decision to threaten the conservative publication The Federalist with removal from the Google Ads platform—based on, apparently, the contents of its comments section—is startling, but apparently just the latest instance of Google’s long pattern of targeting any perspectives that deviate from its preferred party line.
Your company is well aware of the central role played by advertising in the modern online ecosystem, and has spent years amassing an enormous trove of internet users’ data through the Google Ads platform. That, in turn, has granted your company vast powers to shape what users see, believe, and buy. Given the breadth of Google’s data collection practices, the power of Google’s behavioral advertising toolkit, and Google’s sheer market dominance, publishers are forced to do whatever your company demands in order to effectively serve their audiences. Now, your company is attempting to further manipulate the information marketplace by transforming advertising platform access into a cudgel wielded against dissenting voices.
An NBC News report
[1]
lays the responsibility for this move at the feet of the “Center for Countering Digital Hate,” a UK-based think tank devoted to squelching speech it disagrees with. The Center’s mission statement is to “encourage antisocial online behaviour to be met with opprobrium and consequence both on- and offline,” and the Center seeks to ensure that speech not meeting its standards will “lead to serious offline consequences.”
[2]
In particular, the Center runs the “Stop Funding Fake News” website,
[3]
which includes websites like Breitbart and American Greatness among its media targets. The Center demands that outlets be blacklisted by advertisers for such spurious “offenses” as criticizing dominant narratives surrounding climate change.
[4]
Foreign dark-money groups like the Center have no place in adjudicating American political discourse.  And making matters worse, NBC proudly claims responsibility for bringing the Center’s faulty work to Google’s attention.
Moreover, it is profoundly disingenuous for Google to insist on applying a standard to other companies that it disclaims for itself. Google and other technology companies routinely rely on the protections afforded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to evade responsibility for any third-party content posted on the platforms they offer. Now, Google apparently declines to extend a similar protection to those companies that rely on its own services. And the hypocrisy does not stop there: if the contents of a website’s comments sections are sufficient to declare that site offensive and banish it from Google’s platform, one wonders what to make of the cesspit that is the comments section of YouTube. In short, Google demands minimum oversight for itself, but maximum power over those who use its platform.
None of this, apparently, matters to Google. Instead, what’s driving Google’s policy appears to be little more than the politically-motivated opinion commentary of a foreign think tank, as filtered through a legacy media organization bent on muzzling its rivals. If conservative outlets are not welcome on the Google Ads platform, your company should have the courage to say so.
This long pattern of discriminatory treatment must stop. It is well past time for Congress to act. And I assure you that Congress will.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

The bill ensures the United States is able to continue meeting its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act in the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive military build-up. TDA requires the Department of Defense to maintain the ability to defeat a Chinese invasion – and in particular, a Chinese fait accompli – against Taiwan and to report regularly on its progress toward this goal.
“Taiwan is the lynchpin of a free and open Indo-Pacific,”
Senator Hawley said. “If the Chinese Communist Party is allowed to seize control of Taiwan, it will stand ready to dominate the region. This would pose an unacceptable threat to the lives and livelihoods not just of our Asian allies and partners, but of working Americans here at home. We must not allow that to happen.”

Title: Senator Hawley to Zoom: “Pick A Side: American Principles and Free-Speech, or Short-Term Global Profits and Censorship”
Date: Thursday, June 11, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Zoom calling for the company to choose a side: American principles and free-speech, or short-term global profits and censorship. His letter comes after Zoom chose to
close the accounts
of prominent U.S.-based critics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for discussing the Tiananmen Square massacre, claiming the closures were necessary to “comply with local law.”
“These oppressive ‘local laws’ are what Party officials use to oppress more than a billion people, including more than one million Uighurs who have been forced into slavery. These ‘local laws’ are what China is using to crack down on protesters in Hong Kong who just want the basic liberties they were promised by international treaty.”
Senator Josh Hawley
To Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Senator Hawley continued, “Trading American values for Beijing profits never ends well. The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of inviting American companies into its borders, only to steal proprietary information and technology and then repurpose that data for its own use. When you censor for the Communist Chinese Party, you may think it benefits you, but the only one who will benefit in the long run is the Chinese Communist Party.”

Eric Yuan
CEO
Zoom
55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor
San Jose, CA 95113
Dear Mr. Yuan:
One would have thought that a supposedly American company whose claim to fame is serving a fast, virtually seamless video chat would value free speech. But your company appears to have chosen censorship instead. Are you trying to curry favor with the Chinese Communist Party? Reports are trickling in that, in the last few weeks, you have censored many different accounts for discussing the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent massacre.
Just as disturbing is your defense that you censored these conversations and suspended accounts to “comply with local law.” As I am sure you know, “local law” in China is extraordinarily oppressive. China’s so-called “Cyber Security Law” requires companies that do business in China to hand over information to Party officials immediately on demand. In the past few months, additional, even more intrusive, provisions have taken effect. They require companies doing business in China to use network equipment approved by the Chinese Communist Party–equipment that allows Party officials to decrypt and access all data. These oppressive “local laws” are what Party officials use to oppress more than a billion people, including more than one million Uighurs who have been forced into slavery. These “local laws” are what China is using to crack down on protesters in Hong Kong who just want the basic liberties they were promised by international treaty.
Your defense also rings hollow because you have been caught subjecting Zoom calls to those laws unnecessarily. In April, users and watchdog groups discovered that your company was routing communications through servers in China. That routing was entirely unnecessary because none of the participants on those calls were based in China. Yet you still routed calls through China, knowing that, under “local law,” Party officials could access every bit of those calls. Your actions so far suggest not an innocent desire to comply with “local law,” but a desire to curry favor with the Chinese Communist Party so you can better access that market.
Yours is not the first company to trade American values for potential profits in China. Google, in particular, has become infamous for its censorship—from designing two different censorship search engines and blocking terms critical of the Chinese Communist Party to its “errors” mistranslating terms to reframe criticisms of Beijing into praise for Beijing.
But trading American values for Beijing profits never ends well. The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of inviting American companies into its borders, only to steal proprietary information and technology and then repurpose that data for its own use. When you censor for the Communist Chinese Party, you may think it benefits you, but the only one who will benefit in the long run is the Chinese Communist Party.
One week ago today, I sent a letter to American companies like yours, asking them to put American principles and free nations around the world first. Apparently, you did notread that letter because you censored discussions about Tiananmen Square on the very same day. I reiterate today that it is time for you to pick a side: American principles and free-speech, or short-term global profits and censorship.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Blasts Alliance of Democrats and Woke Mob for Trying to Divide Americans
Date: Thursday, June 11, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
spoke on the Senate Floor
calling out the alliance of Democrats and woke mob for their attempts to divide Americans. In the speech, Senator Hawley said that instead of uniting on the cause of justice for George Floyd and building on shared history and struggles, the radical left has “been trying to divide us against each other, to paralyze us, to stoke resentment of our fellow citizens and hatred of the nation we all call home.”
In the speech, Senator Hawley said, “A few short weeks ago we were united in outrage at the murder of George Floyd. We were united in impatience for justice for his family. Nothing has changed about that. All people of goodwill still want justice to be done. I do. But the call of the marchers has been weaponized by partisans, who want nothing more than to say that only some Americans really support equal justice under the law. Only some institutions of government are really committed to that cause. Only one party can be trusted to govern in good faith. And only one political coalition is righteous enough to rule over another.”
Senator Hawley announced that he will offer an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to undo efforts to rename military bases and other assets named after Confederate generals.
Senator Hawley said, “I will offer an amendment to undo this effort at historical revisionism. I will offer it not to celebrate the cause of the Confederacy but to embrace the cause of union, our union, shared together as Americans. It is time for our leaders to stop using their position here to divide us. Let us work together, instead, to build on the history and the responsibility that we share as Americans to continue that ‘unfinished work’ of this nation we call home.”
Full Remarks
We’ve got a lot of problems in America today. A pandemic. A recession. A surge of violence in our major cities drowning out a nationwide call for justice and hope.
We have work to do in this body and in this city to solve these problems and to heed that call. And our voters sent us here to make things better. To rebuild. To heal.
But that’s not what we’re doing.
No, for the last several weeks, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and their allies in the media, and some professional political activists on a payroll, have been trying to divide us against each other, to paralyze us, to stoke resentment of our fellow citizens and hatred of this nation that we all call home.
It’s really remarkable, if you think about, that just a few short weeks ago we were united in outrage at the murder of George Floyd. We were united in impatience for justice for his family.
And nothing has changed about that. All people of good will still want justice to be done. I do. But the call of the marchers has been weaponized by partisans, who want nothing more than to say that only some Americans really support equal justice under the law. Only some institutions of government are really committed to that cause. Only one party can be trusted to govern in good faith. Only one political coalition is righteous enough to rule over the other.
You don’t hear talk of unity watching MSNBC or reading the New York Times these days. Instead those outlets are drawing up a list of new villains.
Not Floyd’s killer. No, not him. We’re way past George Floyd now, I guess. Now we’re talking about new grievances – “structural” evils endemic to America itself. The police. The military. The flag. Oh, and of course, the president.
It’s always about the president.
Actually what it’s really about are the president’s voters. It’s about the people who elected him. It’s about the red states, like mine. It’s about the people who live there. The elite media, the woke mob, they don’t like these people. And they want the rest of America to dislike them too.
This is why they are telling us that it wasn’t a homicidal cop who killed George Floyd. No, his death now is the product of “systemic racism,” we’re told, and anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their role in his death – anyone who doesn’t bend their knee to this extreme ideology – is complicit in violence.
It’s not enough, apparently, to bring Derek Chauvin to justice for his crimes. Now we have to defund all police.
There is no scab they will not pick at, no divide they will not exploit, no controversy they will not gin up to make us hate each other.
But we cannot take their bait.
In the last weeks we’ve seen a professor put on leave for quoting the words of Martin Luther King Jr. Not woke enough.
We’ve seen the New York Times fire its opinion page editor for daring to publish the words of a Republican senator. He forgot the party line.
We’ve seen a literal insurrection in the streets of Seattle – a breakaway antifa enclave ruled by a self-described “warlord,” you cannot make this stuff up – lauded, now, in some quarters at least, as an experiment in post-police governance.
And we’ve had a bill introduced in the House to bring that experiment in chaos to our cities and towns all across the country and to demonize the fine men and women who put their lives on the line day and night to protect protesters’ right to demand justice.
Now, the madness is accelerating this month, but the radical left has been at this for a while.
The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize for the 1619 project, a propaganda campaign designed to recast America’s founding as an evil event and American democracy as a system of violent racial oppression.
It won that prize despite wide criticism by historians who objected to its historical revisionism. And now, with the Pulitzer seal of approval, the Times is developing a 1619 grade school curriculum so that our children will be indoctrinated to hate this country, at taxpayer expense.
They want to do to our public schools what they’ve already done to the universities.
What does any of this have to do with healing our nation? What does it have to do with bringing about that more perfect union whose achievement is our shared ambition and shared obligation as Americans? The answer is, “nothing.” And that’s the point.
As has been widely reported, this week one of my Senate colleagues introduced a measure to strip all military installations and bases in this country of reference to Confederate soldiers or Confederate history. And for what purpose? To achieve justice for George Floyd? To bring our nation together?
No, I don’t think so. The purpose was to erase from history every person and name and event not righteous enough, and to cast those who would object as defenders of the cause of slavery, to reenact in our current politics that Civil War that tore brother against brother and divided this nation against itself.
You’d think the way some in the media talk about this country that they’re sad we’re still not fighting the Civil War. They would like us to fight a new civil war in our culture, day and night, without end.
I’d suggest to my colleagues that the Civil War not only gave us villains, it also gave us heroes and a more perfect union to love.
Maybe we should learn from those heroes. We should learn from Lincoln, who called our nation to unity at Gettysburg.
“It is for us the living,“ he told us, “to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced … to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
You visit Gettysburg and you’ll find monuments to the dead of free states and slave states alike. And you’ll see children who were brought by their parents after long car drives from their homes, drawn in by these old symbols and memorials to the lessons those teach about our nation’s new birth of freedom.
The Americans who visit these hallowed grounds, all across our country, want to know why this nation fought a war against itself – why brothers could not live under one flag together. We teach them there, in those places, how we became a better nation through the crucible of that terrible war. And we teach them there to be proud that we did so.
That hard-fought pride, in the shared struggle that unites us, is now fading. That story is being erased. A nation united in the cause of justice is dividing. And we are increasingly at war with ourselves.
This cannot continue. This great nation and its good people cannot continue our life of freedom together if we vilify and destroy each other from within.
Now, before we vote on this floor on the National Defense Authorization Act, I will offer an amendment to undo this effort at historical revisionism.
I will offer it not to celebrate the cause of the Confederacy but to embrace the cause of union, our union, shared together as Americans. It is time for our leaders to stop using their position here to divide us. Let us work together, instead, to build on the history and the responsibility that we share as Americans to continue that “unfinished work” of this nation that we call home.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for FTC Investigation into Beijing-Backed App Zynn
Date: Wednesday, June 10, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to the Federal Trade Commission asking for an investigation into Zynn. Zynn, an app almost identical to TikTok, has quickly risen to the top of the app store charts and pays users for views and referring friends.
In the letter, Senator Hawley raises concerns that the app’s immediate dominance may drive competitors out of the market, notes that Zynn’s parent company, Kuaishou, has ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and has engaged in promoting propaganda and suppressing criticism, and suspects that Zynn is not abiding by Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements.
“The spread of TikTok, given its well-documented ties to the Chinese government, was worrisome enough; now there are two apps for Americans to be concerned about,”
Senator Hawley writes. “I urge the FTC to immediately open an inquiry into Zynn’s business practices, particularly those pertaining to COPPA compliance, and to make the findings of any investigation public.”

or below.
June 10, 2020
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Simons, Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Chopra, Commissioner Slaughter, and Commissioner Wilson:
Last month, a curious new video-sharing platform rocketed its way to the top of the app store charts. Known as “Zynn,” the app operates almost identically to the enormously popular TikTok app: users upload short videos to the platform, which are then circulated widely between users and may subsequently go viral.
But there’s a twist to Zynn’s business model: users are not only permitted to use the app for free, but are actually paid to watch video content. The most substantial payments come from referrals: just like a traditional pyramid scheme, users receive exponentially larger payouts once they successfully convince others to install Zynn on their own devices. The more devices on which Zynn is installed, the more money early adopters can make.
On its face, this smacks of a textbook predatory-pricing scheme, one calculated to attain immediate market dominance for Zynn by driving competitors out of the market.
[1]
Competition in the social media platform space is particularly essential for American consumers, given the extent to which Facebook, Twitter, and other tech behemoths have throttled innovation by exerting near-monopolistic control over the social media landscape. Anticompetitive practices in this market cannot be tolerated.
Worse, this scheme is being orchestrated by a Beijing-based tech giant with substantial ties to the Chinese Communist Party. By design, video-sharing apps like TikTok empower Chinese leadership to pry into the private affairs of Americans by hoovering up enormous amounts of information on individuals’ daily lives. And it is in light of these concerns that the U.S. military and the TSA have already banned TikTok from the devices issued to its personnel. Anticompetitive practices are bad enough on their own. They are even worse when perpetuated by a company that may be trying to enter the American market to undermine our national security.
And there are serious reasons to question whether Zynn’s ultimate objectives are aligned with the interests of the United States. Zynn is backed by Kuaishou, a Chinese conglomerate that specializes in providing short-form video content to the Chinese market.
[2]
In China, Kuaishou’s video-sharing service has promoted members of the Chinese Communist Party,
[3]
censored content at the behest of the Party,
[4]
distributed forced confessions of detained Uyghur Muslims,
[5]
platformed Party officials bragging about the suppression of religious freedom,
[6]
and suppressed criticism of Party leadership.
[7]
The spread of TikTok, given its well-documented ties to the Chinese government, was worrisome enough; now there are two apps for Americans to be concerned about.
Finally, depending on the extent of the similarities between the Zynn and TikTok platforms, there is good reason to suspect that Zynn may not be abiding by the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)—an error that, in TikTok’s case, gave rise to a 2019 consent decree and $5.7 million fine.
[8]
Americans have a right to know that their data—and their children’s data—is being fully protected and not simply sold to the highest bidder.
Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits companies from engaging in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive practices affecting commerce. And section 6(a) of that same Act provides that the FTC may “gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any person, partnership, or corporation engaged in” commerce in the United States. I urge the FTC to immediately open an inquiry into Zynn’s business practices, particularly those pertaining to COPPA compliance, and to make the findings of any investigation public. 15 U.S.C. § 46(f).
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for Civil Rights Investigation into First Amendment Violations of Religious Americans
Date: Tuesday, June 09, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Attorney General William Barr calling for a civil rights investigation into violations of the First Amendment by state officials who have continued to impose strict caps on religious gatherings and religious speech after allowing thousands of people to gather to attend protests. Senator Hawley writes that Americans have a constitutional right to peaceably protest but state officials are restricting religious speech and religious exercise while encouraging protests, giving preference to one form of speech or gathering over another.
“In the past few weeks, state officials across the country have blatantly violated the free exercise and free speech rights of religious Americans. State officials have determined that the message behind the current protests is worth saying. But state officials cannot block religious speech while allowing protests simply because the states think the protest speech is more valuable.”

June 9, 2020
The Honorable William P. Barr
Attorney General of the United States
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Ave. NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
In the past few weeks, state officials across the country have blatantly violated the free exercise and free speech rights of religious Americans. Under the First Amendment, state officials must not treat religious persons and groups worse than others, and they must not favor one kind of speech over another. State officials have violated the free speech and free exercise rights of religious Americans by treating religious gatherings and speech differently than the speech and mass gatherings of protests. I
urge you to launch a full civil rights investigation.
As our Constitution allows, Americans have the right to peaceably protest. Millions of people are rightly angry about the death of George Floyd, and they should be able to protest peacefully. At the same time, state officials must not use their support for this protest to infringe the free exercise and free speech rights of religious Americans. Yet that is happening across the nation. The First Amendment prohibits state officials from treating religious individuals and groups worse than others. Two weeks ago, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court denied relief to a California church. The decision tilted in favor of the state, the Chief Justice wrote, because of uncertainty about whether the church was being treated worse than comparable secular organizations.
Now, after two weeks of nationwide protests, no uncertainty remains. Many jurisdictions across the nation are imposing extraordinarily strict caps on religious gatherings—such as restricting religious gatherings to 10 or fewer people—even as those jurisdictions allow thousands of people to gather closely in protests. States cannot allow one but prohibit the other.
These actions also violate free speech. The First Amendment prohibits state officials from banning meetings based on the ideas that will be expressed. State officials have determined that the message behind the current protests is worth saying. But state officials cannot block religious speech while allowing protests simply because the states think the protest speech is more valuable.
Because of coronavirus, religious individuals already have been unable to fully celebrate important religious days—Passover, Easter, Ramadan, Pentecost, among others. They should not have to undergo the continued indignity of state officials violating their free exercise and free speech rights as well. I am grateful for your involvement so far on this issue, such as the Department’s May 19 letter to the Governor of California over that state’s problematic mistreatment of religious Americans. I urge you to remain engaged, open a full civil rights investigation, and bring whatever lawsuits are necessary to secure the First Amendment rights of all Americans.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for American Companies in China to Stand Up Against Crackdown in Hong Kong
Date: Thursday, June 04, 2020

Content:
Today, on the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent an open letter
to American companies operating in China calling for them to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) crackdown on Hong Kong. Senator Hawley says the CCP uses its economic power to silence foreign governments and companies but relies on American companies to do so. He calls for these companies to align their actions with their words and stand with the people of Hong Kong.
Senator Hawley said, “In the final calculus, you may be doing business in China. But you are an American company first and foremost. And you have a responsibility to your nation – and indeed, to all free nations of the world – to speak up for what is right. You have an obligation to put principle ahead of profit and to ensure that your actions do not enable the destruction of others’ freedoms. Nowhere is this truer than in Hong Kong, the frontline of the fight against CCP imperialism.”
Senator Hawley requests these companies condemn the CCP’s proposed national security law, reevaluate their activities in China, and ensure they are not complicit in violating Hong Kongers’ basic rights.
Senator Hawley
recently spoke on
the need to reform the global economy and prevent China’s domination.

June 4, 2020
An Open Letter to American Companies in China:
Today marks the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. For decades, many around the world thought that growing prosperity would lead the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to liberalize and show respect for human dignity and freedom. Unfortunately, the CCP has only grown more committed to its authoritarian model as the years have progressed, and today, it is poised once again to destroy a peaceful protest movement, this time in Hong Kong.
The fate of Hong Kong hangs in the balance. The CCP is forging ahead with a national security law that will effectively ban protests in Hong Kong and authorize Beijing to use mainland security agencies to target Hong Kongers. This effort comes a year after millions of Hong Kongers took to the streets to peacefully protest attacks by the CCP and its proxies on the basic rights and liberties promised to them under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law. If Beijing enacts the national security law as it has promised to, it will mean the death of democracy in Hong Kong.
American companies like your own have a say in what happens next. The CCP may not care about freedom, democracy, or any of the other things for which we, as Americans, have long stood and fought. But it does care about you. It cares about the business you bring to its shores, and more importantly, about the opportunities your business provides for it to grow its own economy and then use its economic power against others.
Indeed, for decades, Beijing has studied, stolen, and replicated your best practices and products in order to propel its own commercial expansion. It has simultaneously mastered the art of economic intimidation and used its growing economic power to silence the world’s nations, corporations, and others while it crushes those it deems a threat to its rule or hegemonic ambitions. None of this would be possible without access to companies like your own, from which it has learned and gained so much.
Although the CCP has grown stronger over the years, it still has a way to go before it can dominate the United States and others seeking to live free from Chinese coercion. That is why your voices matter. The CCP knows that its economic fortunes are still tied to your companies’ participation in its markets. If it knows that you may retract that participation in response to the Hong Kong crackdown, then it may yet restrain itself. And some vestige of freedom – some glimmer of hope – might yet live on in that city. This is the power you hold.
In the final calculus, you may be doing business in China. But you are an American company first and foremost. And you have a responsibility to your nation – and indeed, to all free nations of the world – to speak up for what is right. You have an obligation to put principle ahead of profit and to ensure that your actions do not enable the destruction of others’ freedoms. Nowhere is this truer than in Hong Kong, the frontline of the fight against CCP imperialism.
With that in mind, I request your response to the following questions:
Have you publicly condemned the CCP’s proposed national security law and other attacks by Beijing and its proxies on Hong Kongers’ basic rights and liberties?
If you have not, why have you chosen to remain silent, and do you plan to speak out publicly against the CCP’s crackdown in Hong Kong?
Have you reevaluated your presence or activities in China in light of the crackdown in Hong Kong?
What other steps are you taking to ensure your company is not complicit in the violation of Hong Kongers’ basic rights and liberties?
What additional steps are you taking to stand with the people of Hong Kong?
Time and again, companies like your own have claimed to stand for freedom. Now is your opportunity to align your actions with your words. The CCP’s crackdown in Hong Kong poses an unignorable threat to the values you purport to hold dear. It is time for you to stand with the people of Hong Kong and show that your claims are more than just hollow words.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Blasts Rod Rosenstein For Role in Historic FBI Scandal
Date: Wednesday, June 03, 2020

Content:
Today during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) grilled former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about his role in the FBI’s investigation of President Trump and his staff during the 2016 election and subsequent surveillance after he assumed office. Senator Hawley sharply criticized Rosenstein for testifying that he did not read an FBI wiretap application before signing off on it and that he failed to ensure that it was accurate before rubberstamping it.
“Of course, now my Democrat friends say there’s nothing to see here because now we have one of the largest scandals ever to engulf the FBI and the DOJ,”
said Senator Hawley. “These circumstances simply are not acceptable, Mr. Chairman. And that’s why I’m glad we’re doing this. But we’ve got to hold somebody accountable for it.”

Date: Tuesday, June 02, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement on the shooting of four police officers in St. Louis overnight:
“The police officer shootings in St. Louis overnight are despicable. My prayers go out to the officers and their families. And my heartfelt thanks goes to them as well. These officers, and thousands more around our state, choose to put their lives on the line every day, and every night, to protect the neighborhoods we call home. The perpetrators who attacked them last night must be brought to justice. And we must bring order to our cities and towns now. Violence threatens to destroy the fabric of our communities and undermine our ability to live and act together. Every American has a right to assemble and protest peaceably, but mindless violence is not protest, it is further injustice that harms us all.”

Title: Senator Hawley Demands SBA Explain Unacceptable Delays in Disaster Loan Program
Date: Tuesday, June 02, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza criticizing persistent delays in disbursing disaster loans and an unacceptable lack of communication from the agency. In response to reports that loan amounts under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program have been capped at $150,000, Senator Hawley writes that applicants have been permitted to borrow up to $2 million in previous disasters, and the intent of Congress was not for the SBA to place, new arbitrary limits on EIDL loans related to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Many of my constituents have been waiting for months now, with no updates about when they can expect their loans to be deposited in their accounts. When these constituents make formal inquires to SBA about their loan status, they are often given generic responses with no real timeline to help manage expectations,” said Senator Hawley. “Small businesses and workers across the country are urgently waiting for this relief and I urge you to take immediate action to disburse the remaining EIDL loans as expeditiously as possible.”
Senator Hawley requested Administrator Carranza explain when the SBA imposed an upper limit on EIDL loans, why they decided to do so, and whether the EIDL program needs more appropriations from Congress.
In a previous letter to Administrator Carranza, Senator Hawley expressed concerns about reports of significant delays in the EIDL program.

Dear Administrator Carranza:
I write with increasing alarm about the implementation of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. As I stated in my letter to you dated April 10, 2020, persistent delays concerning the EIDL program—coupled with a lack of communication—are unacceptable. While I appreciate that many emergency advance grants have now been disbursed, applicants in my state are still waiting for their principal loan amounts to be delivered. These issues reflect mismanagement of a critical relief program and must be fixed immediately.
As you know, since the EIDL program was operable before the Paycheck Protection Program, many small businesses decided to choose this route for relief. Yet, many of my constituents have been waiting for months now, with no updates about when they can expect their loans to be deposited in their accounts. When these constituents make formal inquires to SBA about their loan status, they are often given generic responses with no real timeline to help manage expectations. As you can imagine, this lack of certainty amplifies the difficulty of making critical business decisions in an already challenging environment.
Due to these delays, you can appreciate the frustration of my constituents when they discovered that loan amounts would be capped at $150,000. In previous disasters, applicants have been permitted to borrow up to $2 million, a maximum amount set out in statute. It was not the intent of Congress that SBA reduce this maximum loan amount when implementing the provisions of the CARES Act and other recent legislation. As you know, Congress provided $50 billion in additional funds for this program last month through the Paycheck Protection Program and  Healthcare Enhancement Act, opening up even more resources for SBA to disburse EIDL loans. It’s disappointing that the $2.1 billion Congress appropriated in that same legislation for salaries, expenses, and administrative support to SBA has yet to yield better results.
Small businesses and workers across the country are urgently waiting for this relief and I urge you to take immediate action to disburse the remaining EIDL loans as expeditiously as possible. I also urge you to communicate with EIDL applicants immediately as to when they can expect to receive their loans. On the subject of the limit you have placed on the EIDL loan amounts, please answer the following questions by June 10, 2020:
Some EIDL loan recipients have received funds in excess of $150,000. When did SBA impose this upper limit on funds for those with COVID-19 disruptions? Why was this done without an official public announcement?
Is this limit identical for all applicants? Or are there exceptions?
Why did SBA decide to impose this limit on EIDL loans?
What analysis and justification did you use to arrive at the $150,000 maximum amount?
If the program is in need of more appropriations to operate as Congress intended, can you provide an estimate for what additional resources are needed?
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Gives Remarks on Death of George Floyd & Riots
Date: Monday, June 01, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) spoke on the Senate Floor about the death of George Floyd and called for an end to the violent riots across the country.

Title: Statement on Riots
Date: Sunday, May 31, 2020

Content:
Last night a group of looters and vandals took to the streets in the Ferguson area of St. Louis to cause damage and harm. The governor was right to activate the National Guard to protect residents and neighborhoods and stop lawless violence.
Like so many others, I have seen the video of George Floyd’s death, and I am appalled by it. It should never have happened. In our country, our Constitution and laws forbid those with government power to abuse it to the harm of others. And our laws provide redress when they do. And there must be redress, there must be justice, here. And Americans have every right to assemble and call for that redress and justice.
But looting and burning and assault are something else entirely. They endanger innocent citizens and police officers, they destroy the livelihoods of neighbors and friends, they deface and disfigure the communities we call home. And they must stop. I salute the police officers and guardsmen and women who are putting their lives on the line to keep our homes safe. And I join those other Missourians and Americans who want to work together and anew so that, in the words of the Scripture, “the poor may have hope, and injustice shut its mouth.”

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Call for Investigation into TikTok’s Children’s Privacy Practices
Date: Friday, May 29, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.)
wrote
to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging the agency to investigate new evidence that the popular video social media platform TikTok has violated the privacy of its young users and failed to abide by the terms of a 2019 settlement with the FTC.
Last year, the FTC placed TikTok under a consent decree after finding that the company had repeatedly violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). That settlement required the app to take several steps to improve their privacy practices. However, new research findings from leading children’s privacy experts suggest that TikTok failed to delete all information collected about users under age 13, failed to follow multiple legally binding transparency requirements, and failed to give parents the option to review and delete their children’s data from the platform.
“Federal privacy laws, regulations promulgated under those laws, and consent decrees resulting from privacy violations are effective only if they are vigorously enforced,”
write the Senators in their letter to the FTC Chairman and Commissioners.
“As the ongoing public health crisis continues to catalyze children’s increased tech use, the FTC must increase its attention to the dangers that minors encounter online, including the manipulation of kids’ attention and their data for advertising dollars.”
Senator Hawley recently
joined a bipartisan letter
to the FTC, urging it to use its authority under the FTC Act to launch an investigation into children’s data practices in the educational technology and digital advertising sectors.
Senator Hawley has also raised other concerns with TikTok. He has introduced
legislation
to prohibit TikTok from sending data on children, or anyone else, to China and
legislation
to ban TikTok from all government devices.

Title: Senator Hawley Raises Missouri Farmers’ Concerns with Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to UDSA
Date: Thursday, May 28, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to ask for clarity on issues with the
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program
(CFAP) brought to him by Missouri farmers. In the letter, Senator Hawley raises the concerns of cattle producers, who feel penalized by the program for not selling their cattle at the bottom of the market, and of row crop farmers, who may be ineligible for aid because they didn’t have a crop in 2019 due to natural disasters.
“I write to thank you for your timely work on the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). This program will provide much needed relief to thousands of Missouri producers and help to secure their vital role in our nation’s food supply. I also write to inform you of two concerns that have been raised by my constituents in the few days since the program was announced. They need your assistance,”
Senator Hawley said. “For many in my state this program will be the difference between farming another year or shutting down altogether.”

Dear Secretary Perdue:
I write to thank you for your timely work on the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). This program will provide much needed relief to thousands of Missouri producers and help to secure their vital role in our nation’s food supply. I also write to inform you of two concerns that have been raised by my constituents in the few days since the program was announced. They need your assistance.
First, cattle producers in my state have tried in earnest to navigate the pandemic and the concurrent collapse in prices. Amidst rapidly changing conditions and with limited information, producers made the best business decisions they could–not knowing if, when, or how aid might come. Many producers now feel the CFAP payment program penalizes them for not selling their cattle at the bottom of the market. I ask that you address this discrepancy to ensure producers get sufficient aid to address their needs.
Second, I have heard from row crop farmers who have raised a serious concern regarding the provision of aid for non-specialty crops. The rule states, “Eligible inventory for the purpose of nonspecialty crops is the lower of self-certified unpriced inventory that an eligible producer has vested ownership in as of January 15, 2020, or 50 percent of the eligible producer’s 2019 production of that commodity.” This may be an effective way to make aid available for up to half a year’s worth of stored grain, but some farmers in my state did not have a crop in 2019 due to disasters, specifically flooding. Missouri farmers devastated by these events are worried that they will be deemed ineligible. I ask that you address this unintended consequence and make certain that aid is available to producers as was intended.
For many in my state this program will be the difference between farming another year or shutting down altogether. Thank you for your continued support for agriculture and attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Blunt, Long Ask USDA to Approve Convoy of Hope’s Farmers to Families Food Box Program Application

Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Representative Billy Long (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue regarding the denial of Convoy of Hope’s application to participate in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Their letter notes that Convoy of Hope, based in Springfield, Mo., has distributed over $1 billion in emergency food aid to more than 130 million people since its founding and urged the USDA to reconsider its decision to deny their application.
“Convoy of Hope has swiftly responded to the needs of thousands of Americans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and has distributed over 15 million meals since March,”
they wrote. “We urge you to reconsider this decision. If that is not possible, we ask that you move swiftly to give clear explanation as to why they were excluded and provide the necessary feedback to ensure that the organization’s tremendous resources and expertise can be put to use in future partnerships with USDA.”

The Honorable Sonny Perdue
Secretary
U.S. Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20250
Dear Secretary Perdue:
We write to seek clarification regarding the contracts granted under the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. As you may know, since its founding more than 25 years ago, Convoy of Hope has distributed over $1 billion in emergency food aid to more than 130 million people in the United States and around the word through partnerships with businesses, churches, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. That is why we were surprised and disappointed to hear that Convoy of Hope’s application to participate in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program was denied.
Convoy of Hope has swiftly responded to the needs of thousands of Americans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and has distributed over 15 million meals since March. Convoy of Hope has so many requests for assistance that it has suspended taking requests because it lacks enough food to distribute. To their credit, despite being denied, they have been connecting USDA’s contract winners with their partners in order to ensure needs are being met.
We urge you to reconsider this decision. If that is not possible, we ask that you move swiftly to give clear explanation as to why they were excluded and provide the necessary feedback to ensure that the organization’s tremendous resources and expertise can be put to use in future partnerships with USDA.
Sincerely,

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Google Explain Continued Censorship of Criticism of CCP
Date: Wednesday, May 27, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai calling on the company to provide an explanation for reports that
YouTube is censoring comments
critical of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In his letter, Senator Hawley describes a disturbing pattern of Google’s censoring criticism to curry favor with the CCP, calling for a specific account of when the company became aware of this “error” and what steps they have taken to correct it.
“Despite your stated commitments to free speech, you were happy to censor if it meant obtaining more revenue; you shelved the Google.cn search engine only after you were targeted with a cyberattack. Indeed, as recently as last year, you were secretly working on a new censorship-based search engine, Project Dragonfly, development of which was paused only in the face of immense backlash internally,”
said Senator Hawley. “Selling out American principles to curry favor with communist officials is no way to run an American business—regardless of who else is doing it.”
Senator Hawley has
previously called for
Google to explain similar “errors” silencing critics of the CCP and demanded
the company publicly address
it relationship with Beijing.

Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google LLC
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
I write to ask you to respond to troubling reports that your company has resumed its long pattern of censorship at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.
These reports suggest that Google engineers may have changed the algorithms on YouTube to automatically censor certain criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party. In particular, Google engineers appear to have altered YouTube code to automatically block the Chinese terms for “communist bandit” and “50-cent party”—the latter term referring to a division of the Chinese Communist Party whose purpose is deflecting criticism from the Party by using sockpuppet accounts to spread online propaganda.
[1]
These reports follow in the wake of Google’s purported “mis”-translation last year of the phrase “I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China” to “I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China.”
Shortly after these reports were unveiled, YouTube dismissed the censorship of these terms as “an error,” but this purported “error” follows a long, disturbing pattern of Google censoring content to try to gain favor with the Chinese Communist Party. Until 2010, for example, you actively censored content through your search engine Google.cn, which operated in China. Despite your stated commitments to free speech, you were happy to censor if it meant obtaining more revenue; you shelved the Google.cn search engine only after you were targeted with a cyberattack. Indeed, as recently as last year, you were secretly working on a new censorship-based search engine, Project Dragonfly, development of which was paused only in the face of immense backlash internally.
[2]
Even worse, while Google.cn at least disclosed to users that it was censoring content, Google engineers designed Project Dragonfly to conceal that fact.
Unfortunately, your company is not alone in censoring content to curry favor with the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, Apple removed the Taiwan flag emoji from iPhones operating in Hong Kong.
[3]
And last fall, the NBA, famous for encouraging players and members to criticize American government officials, cracked down when individuals started criticizing officials in Beijing.
[4]
This kowtowing is unacceptable. Selling out American principles to curry favor with communist officials is no way to run an American business—regardless of who else is doing it. Please respond to my office by June 12 with information about your censorship of terms critical of the Chinese Communist Party:
Identify any discussions you or other executives have had—and conclusions from those discussions—about the potential conflict between Google’s financial interest in developing products for the Chinese market and Google’s purported commitment to free speech and human rights.
Some reports suggest that this censorship problem first arose last fall. Identify when you became aware that YouTube was censoring this content and how much time elapsed between that time and May 26, 2020.
Identify any discussions you or other executives have had, the timing of those discussions, any conclusions arrived at during those discussions, and the results of any internal investigations about YouTube’s censorship of the Chinese terms for “communist bandit” and “50-cent party.”
Describe the date of, and circumstances surrounding, the changes that led YouTube to censor the Chinese terms for “communist bandit” and “50-cent party.”
Explain Google’s reason for censoring these terms.
Explain what consideration, if any, was given to Google’s history of censoring content on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party before this most recent censorship of terms critical of the Chinese Communist Party.
Explain whether Google or its partners had any conversations with members, representatives, or proxies of the Chinese Communist Party about these terms.
Explain what steps have been taken to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party cannot manipulate Google’s algorithms.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Sen. Hawley Writes Twitter CEO: Twitter Should Lose Immunity If Editorializing On Political Speech
Date: Wednesday, May 27, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a
letter
to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey questioning why Twitter should continue to receive special immunity from the federal government after choosing to editorialize on President Trump’s tweets. Twitter currently receives special immunity under the law in what’s known as Section 230, which states that companies that merely distribute user content should not be treated like a publisher, such as the New York Times or the Washington Post. But, with Twitter’s decision to editorialize on President Trump’s tweets, the company appears to be acting like shifting to a publisher, and Senator Hawley is asking why Twitter should continue to receive special protection for distributors if it is going to act like a publisher.
Senator Hawley also questions whether President Trump was targeted for political purposes or if Twitter will similarly fact check President Trump’s political opponents like Joe Biden and Chinese Communist Party propaganda.
“Twitter’s unprecedented decision to single out the President for disfavor, based on his political speech, is alarming,” Senator Hawley writes.
“Yesterday, for the first time ever, Twitter branded the President’s tweets with a ‘fact check’ designed to encourage readers to believe that the President’s political speech was inaccurate. Twitter’s decision to editorialize regarding the content of political speech raises questions about why Twitter should continue receiving special status and special immunity from publisher liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.”

Jack Dorsey
CEO
Twitter
1355 Market Street, Suite 900
San Francisco, CA 94103
Dear Mr. Dorsey:
Twitter’s unprecedented decision to single out the President for disfavor, based on his political speech, is alarming. Yesterday, for the first time ever, Twitter branded the President’s tweets with a “fact check” designed to encourage readers to believe that the President’s political speech was inaccurate. Twitter’s decision to editorialize regarding the content of political speech raises questions about why Twitter should continue receiving special status and special immunity from publisher liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
Twitter’s “fact check” raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons. Employees working for the team responsible for Twitter’s fact-checking policies have a stark history of derogatory comments against both the President and people who voted for him. For example, Twitter’s Head of Site Integrity encouraged people to “fly over” states like Missouri because Missourians supposedly “voted for a racist tangerine.” That employee also called people who work for the President “actual Nazis.”
Meanwhile, where has Twitter been in response to the outright lies and propaganda by the Chinese Communist Party and its so-called “wolf warriors,” busy blaming American soldiers for the start of COVID-19 on social media? Will Twitter also “fact check” these outrageous statements? What about other candidates for political office, like former Vice-President Joe Biden? Will Twitter editorialize regularly in response to his comments on social media? Or will Twitter only go after people its employees dislike?
Instead of allowing viewers to look at the dialogue around the President’s tweets and assess for themselves the merits of the President’s views, Twitter decided to editorialize, appending its own comments and assessment to the President’s speech. But editorializing is what publishers do, like the New York Times and the Washington Post. Your company is treated very differently from publishers, as you know. Traditional publishers are liable when they mess up. But under Section 230, Twitter receives a special government carve-out that shields it from liability. That statute tells courts to treat Twitter like a passive distributor of third-party content. Twitter’s decision to affix its own editorial content to users’ posts brings into question the basis for that immunity.
It makes little sense to treat companies that publish their editorial comments about others’ content as if they are mere distributors. Companies that act like publishers should be treated like publishers. Section 230 should not treat Twitter and neutral internet service providers in the same way when they function so differently.
Please send a prompt response by June 15 identifying the sources on which Twitter relied to decide to editorialize regarding the President’s political speech, and please explain why you think that companies that act like publishers should not be treated like publishers.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces Resolution Condemning China’s Plans to Violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong Basic Law

Content:
Today, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced a resolution
with more than ten cosponsors condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) proposed “
sweeping national security law
” for Hong Kong that would ban secession, subversion, and foreign interference.
Senator Hawley’s resolution states unequivocally that passage of this proposed law would put the Beijing in direct violation of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law. The resolution also calls upon all free nations to stand firm against the CCP’s campaign to destroy Hongkongers’ basic liberties and human rights.
Senator Hawley said, “With the world focused on the pandemic, Beijing thinks this is their opportunity to steamroll Hong Kong. They say they want to ‘improve’ the lives of Hongkongers, but in reality, that means stripping the people of Hong Kong of the basic rights and liberties guaranteed to them under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law. This resolution condemns the Chinese Communist Party’s premeditated violation of these agreements and calls on other free nations to join with us. We must stand up to China’s continued imperialism, and if the Beijing government goes through with this, then we need to be ready to respond strongly, including by reconsidering their trade status.”

Title: Senator Hawley Asks SBA to Explain Planned Parenthood Loans Scandal
Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2020

Content:
Today,
following reports
that Planned Parenthood received at least $80 million in loans intended for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza requesting an explanation from the SBA and an outline of the steps they are taking to correct their error.
“Planned Parenthood is not a small business. It is a multi-billion-dollar company. In the fiscal year ending last June, Planned Parenthood had $2.3 billion in assets and nearly $2 billion in revenue. The year before, Planned Parenthood paid its CEO more than $1 million. And now, Planned Parenthood has diverted $80 million from actual small businesses during a global pandemic even though Planned Parenthood knew it was ineligible for this program,”
said Senator Hawley. “The ease with which Planned Parenthood was able to unlawfully divert $80 million should concern everyone.”
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act prohibits Planned Parenthood from receiving PPP funds as Planned Parenthood’s own documents state that each organization is a “Planned Parenthood Affiliate.” Planned Parenthood therefore has about 16,000 employees in total, more than 30 times higher than the limit for the Paycheck Protection Program.
Since the passage of the CARES Act, Senator Hawley has called on the SBA to provide
economic injury disaster loans to small businesses,
provide relief to churches and religious nonprofits, and
conduct rigorous oversight of PPP
to ensure that big banks do not undermine the program.
Read the full text of the letter
here
or below.
Dear Administrator Carranza:
I am extremely concerned about the reports of Planned Parenthood affiliates receiving $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans from the Small Business Administration. Planned Parenthood is plainly ineligible for the program, and it is critical to identify how and why this was able to happen.
From the very beginning, Planned Parenthood’s exclusion from the Paycheck Protection Program has been well known and the subject of much discussion. That is because the CARES Act that Congress passed into law in March expressly stated that organizations like Planned Parenthood are ineligible for the program. Section 1102 of that law says that nonprofits are eligible for the program only if they and their affiliate organizations have no more than 500 employees. As the White House correctly said last month, Planned Parenthood, at about 16,000 employees nationally, fails to meet this requirement.
Despite this text and public understanding, 37 Planned Parenthood offices still applied for and received funds from the program. But even Planned Parenthood admits that every one of its offices—regional and national—are affiliated, making each office ineligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. Planned Parenthood’s most recent financial statement describes the organization as one national branch, 55 “Planned Parenthood Affiliates,” and 110 “ancillary entities” that are “control[led]” by those “Planned Parenthood Affiliates.” Planned Parenthood further stresses that “The [national] Organization, PP Affiliates and the ancillary organizations together comprise Planned Parenthood.”
In the light of the clear text of the CARES Act and Planned Parenthood’s own admission that every one of its offices are affiliated with each other, it is hard to conclude anything other than that Planned Parenthood committed fraud. The SBA application form required each of the 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates to certify that Planned Parenthood, as a whole, employs no more than 500 employees. The application form further required Planned Parenthood to certify that it “underst[oo]d that knowingly making a false statement to obtain a guaranteed loan from SBA is punishable under the law.” Yet even though Planned Parenthood employs 16,000 people, and even though Planned Parenthood itself admits that all its offices are affiliated, Planned Parenthood falsely certified 37 times that it employs no more than 500 employees.
Planned Parenthood is not a small business. It is a multi-billion-dollar company. In the fiscal year ending last June, Planned Parenthood had $2.3 billion in assets and nearly $2 billion in revenue. The year before, Planned Parenthood paid its CEO more than $1 million. And now, Planned Parenthood has diverted $80 million from actual small businesses during a global pandemic even though Planned Parenthood knew it was ineligible for this program.
The question is how this could happen. Why, when 37 Planned Parenthood offices applied under the program, did your system not flag these applications? Did you not appropriately instruct lending organizations? The ease with which Planned Parenthood was able to unlawfully divert $80 million should concern everyone. Promptly respond to the following requests:
Identify each Planned Parenthood affiliate that improperly applied for funds, and provide copies of their applications.
Identify each Planned Parenthood affiliate that improperly received funds.
Identify each lending institution through which these Planned Parenthood affiliates applied.
Identify each regional SBA official who was responsible for funds that went to Planned Parenthood.
Explain what methods you took to instruct lending organizations not to lend funds to ineligible organizations.
Explain why your processes did not automatically flag applications from Planned Parenthood and freeze those funds.
Identify the steps you are taking to ensure that Planned Parenthood returns these improperly diverted funds, with interest.
Identify all criminal referrals you have made for fraud and lying on government forms.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Gives Floor Speech on Reforming the Global Economy, Preventing China’s Domination
Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) took to the Senate floor to make the case for reforming the global economy and preventing China’s domination.
Remarks as prepared are below.
We have come to the middle hour of our struggle against the epidemic, against a disease unleashed on the world by the failures and lies of the government in Beijing.
This epidemic has brought devastation in its wake. Lost lives, lost jobs, fear, isolation.
And it is shaking old institutions and challenging old ways. The international order as we have known it for thirty years is breaking. Now imperialist China seeks to remake the world in its own image, and to bend the global economy to its own will.
And we face a moment of truth. Will we acquiesce? Are we in this nation willing to witness the slow destruction of the free world? Are we willing to watch our own way of life, our own liberties and livelihoods, grow dependent on the policy of Beijing?
Already we hear a chorus of voices telling us that America must accept a narrower future. We must live with slower economic growth. We must expect lower wages. We must accommodate ourselves to the rise of China.
Well, I, for one, am not willing to settle for less. I am not willing to see blue collar workers go without work for months or years on end as their jobs are sent overseas. I am not willing to watch wages flatline and fall. I am not willing to see families struggle for food and middle-class neighborhoods collapse.
And Mr. President, neither is America.
The nation that sent a man to the moon and liberated the world from German and Soviet oppression in the space of fifty years will not be content with a small future. We will not gladly take second place to the imperialists in Beijing.
And so now, as in times past, this nation must again take control of our own destiny and lead the free world to a better day.
The free nations again confront a common threat. The Chinese Communist Party is a menace to all free peoples.
It seeks nothing less than domination. It wants nothing less than world power. This is China’s policy: to control Asia and to rule the Pacific. From there, the Chinese government wants to spread its influence to Africa, to Europe, to South America—a master of home and abroad.
And they are well on their way. For decades now, China has bent, and abused, and broken the rules of the international economic system to its own benefit. They have stolen our intellectual property and forced our companies to transfer sensitive trade secrets and technology. They have manipulated their currency and cheated time and again on their trade commitments. They have been complicit in the trafficking of persons and relied upon the forced labor of religious minorities.
And America has suffered. Since Beijing won Most Favored Nation status and joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, we have lost over three million jobs to China. During the past two decades, as we fought war after war in the Middle East, the Chinese government systematically built its military on the backs of our middle class.
We were promised things would be different. We were told that giving China access to our markets and allowing them power in the WTO would reform their behavior, make them more liberal. We were told it would be good for America and for the world.
Well, the only nation it was good for was China. And we cannot afford inaction any longer.
The threat of China to the free world grows by the day. If the coronavirus pandemic doesn’t make that clear, nothing will.
But what should be equally clear is that the United States must now reform the global economy itself to rebuild our strength and prevent China’s bid for domination.
The economy has become the principal arena for the great power contest of this century. Economic policy is now security policy.
China knows this. It has integrated its economic and security strategies for the last two decades, systematically weaponizing the institutions and procedures of the global economy for its own benefit. The United States has been slow to respond.
Now we must recognize that the economic system designed by Western policy makers at the end of the Cold War does not serve our purposes in this new era, and it does not meet our needs for this new day.
And we should admit that multiple of its founding premises were in error.
The economic system of the last thirty years—it’s nothing sacred. It’s not inevitable. It was a choice. And we have it in our power to choose differently now and for the better.
***
It didn’t start out this way. Decades ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the United States and its allies created a series of economic partnerships and institutions that aimed to strengthen the free world and check Soviet expansion.
These agreements encouraged partnership and trade among free nations, as sovereign equals. And trade and commerce increased, barriers came down. But nations remained in control of their own economies and their own destinies. Important sectors were protected, capital flows controlled. And workers had a place to rise.
But when the Soviet Union fell, ambitious policy makers in this country and other western nations saw the opportunity to create something new, something in the spirit of Woodrow Wilson, a dream to remake the world. These western leaders wanted a truly global economy to include all nations, likeminded or not, to be governed by multilateral institutions rather than nation-states, to operate by a single set of rules, to promote the flow of goods and capital across borders.
They wanted a single liberal market to support a single, liberal international order that would bring peace in our time.
That peace never arrived. Instead, these new Wilsonians embroiled the United States in conflict after conflict, war after war, for decades. And the new global market they championed flatlined the wages of American workers and shipped American industry overseas, all while multinational corporations reaped the gains.
One of the Wilsonians’ new institutions particularly typified these trends. I’m talking about the World Trade Organization.
It was established in 1995 as a successor to the Cold-War era General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The idea was for the WTO to help harmonize trading rules the world over—and have the teeth to enforce them. The WTO would have its own court, a dispute resolution body, that would interpret trade agreements and settle the differences between nations over trade. The effect was to take trade disputes out of the hands of elected national leaders and commit them to the control of international lawyers, in Geneva.
And it worked—in the sense that the WTO’s court increasingly set trade policy for the world. The old system, the GATT, had allowed for national policy needs to come first—our workers and our industries. But the WTO reversed these priorities. Now global concerns reigned supreme, which meant the priorities of multinational corporations and global capital.
And not surprisingly, the WTO lawyers have not been kind to America. The WTO’s dispute resolution process has systemically disfavored the United States, a complaint that presidents of both parties have lodged for years. The United States has lost ninety percent of the cases brought against it, hurting industries across our nation, from steel workers in the Rust Belt to cotton farmers in states like my own.
Meanwhile the WTO dispute resolution body has systematically expanded its jurisdiction, going beyond the text of the actual trade agreements and citing itself as authority.
And that’s not all. The WTO permitted China to claim special status as a “developing country” from the moment it joined the group, even though China was already the sixth-richest nation in the world by GDP in 2000. And China jealously guards this sweetheart deal even today, allowing it to defer its obligations, to skirt the rules that we follow, and to continue to amass power at our expense.
I could go on. The WTO places strict limits on the support we can provide our farmers and ranchers, even as other nations refuse to comply with WTO rulings in favor of our producers.
It’s clear that the WTO is deeply flawed. The institution’s design makes it nearly impossible to reform, as we saw during the failed Doha Round. And it remains completely unequipped to deal with forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft like we’ve seen from China for decades.
The American people get the idea. No trade regime can last when it no longer serves the people of the countries who are part of it. Our interests and those of the WTO diverged long ago.
The WTO is a symbol of an economic order whose Wilsonian ambitions have cost this country dearly, enabling and empowering the rise of an imperial China. And now American leadership is required—it is essential—to chart a new course.
This nation has never been content to linger in the rear while others lead the way. And we will not begin now. We will lead. We will act.
And I call on this body to do its part by taking a vote to withdraw from the WTO. The agreement by which we joined the organization expressly affords us this right. It commits to the Congress, both houses, the right to debate the WTO’s workings and to vote to continue in that body or withdraw.
This is a right, a responsibility, really, that the Senate has never exercised since 1995, not once. We are past due. We should take up our responsibility and debate this issue, critical to the future of our country. And we should vote to leave.
To begin a new era, we must end the old. So let us vote and let it be a new beginning.
And let the work begin in earnest to forge a new way forward.
Thinking of that future, Mr. President, I offer two principles to guide our policy. First, as a member of the world economy, we must never privilege the preferences of other nations or multilateral institutions over the needs of our own people and workers.
And as the leader of the free world, we must empower other countries to resist Chinese imperialism at every turn, whether on their own or together as a coalition.
To put these principles into action, we must leave the WTO and construct a new trade system that helps the United States grow strong.
This new system should retain and deepen the principle of reciprocity. It should encourage cooperation and market access, but without compromising nations’ economic sovereignty and their internal control of their own economies. We in America cannot compromise our sovereign right to protect the American people and their livelihoods.
So we must replace an empire of lawyers with a confederation of truly mutual trade.
And mutual trade will require a new approach to dispute resolution, one that will offer nations flexibility and choice. Allow countries to litigate trade disputes like a private contract, through third-party arbitration chosen by the parties on a case-by-case basis, with ground rules agreed upon by both sides and subject to revision as circumstances change. Or allow countries to set up enforcement procedures within the trade agreement, as we have recently done in our Phase I negotiations with China.
On either approach, choices over trade will be made and policies set as they should be, by elected leaders accountable to the people, not a court sitting in Geneva.
But reform should not stop at trade.
We must also think seriously about what occurs upstream from trade. And that is global capital.
There is a reason why Wall Street loves the status quo. There is a reason why they will object to leaving the WTO and resist major reforms to our global economic system. That’s because they are on a gravy train of foreign capital flows that keep their checkbooks fat.
But this foreign money pouring into our country has a distorting effect. We get asset bubbles that can spur recession, and our exporters have trouble selling abroad. Our farmers and producers know this problem all too well.
So now we must work for new agreements to better manage capital markets and stop currency manipulators. By moderating these flows of foreign money, we can help give a much-needed boost to our producers at home, and finally reverse our massive trade deficit with China and with the world.
Finally, Mr. President, actions at home are only part of the solution. Trade and currency policy are not made in a vacuum. The world is changing, and if we are to halt China’s bid for hegemony over the coming decades, we will need to work with our allies and partners to do it.
So it is in America’s interests to see that other free nations grow strong and that we are able to work together to deter Chinese economic coercion.
We benefit if countries that share our opposition to Chinese imperialism—countries like India and Japan, Vietnam, Australia and Taiwan—are economically independent of China, and standing shoulder to shoulder with us. So we should actively pursue new networks of mutual trade with key Asian and European partners, like the economic prosperity network recently mentioned by Secretary Pompeo.
And we should offer partner nations new incentives and support to purchase our products, made here in America by American workers. A new system of export financing and loan guarantees would serve as a powerful counterweight to China’s expanding Belt and Road Initiative. And it would boost demand for our products, raising wages and creating good jobs along the way.
Here again, our aim must be to build networks of strong partners able to stand tall against Chinese aggression while strengthening our workers and encouraging our industries.
***
Mr. President, a new departure is upon us whether we like it or not. The old order is giving way. But the future need not be limited, not for this country. This moment is full of promise, if we have the courage to lead.
We can build a future that looks beyond pandemic to prosperity—a prosperity shared by all Americans, from our rural towns to the urban core.
We can build a future that looks past a failed consensus to meet our national security needs in this new century.
We can build a future that transcends the narrow thinking of the Washington beltway and that gives confidence to American workers and the communities they call home.
With a global economy that better suits our interests, that better protects our people, we can find the strength and purpose to counter the gravest danger to the American nation in a century, and to unleash again the promise of our unique and marvelous way of life.
To my colleagues in the Senate: It is time to lead.
Thank you.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on Coast Guard to Adopt NTSB Recommendations from Report on Table Rock Lake Tragedy
Date: Monday, May 18, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Admiral Karl L. Schultz, Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, urging the adoption of the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) safety recommendations issued in last month’s
report
on the 2018 tragedy on Table Rock Lake.
In the letter, Senator Hawley notes the accident on Table Rock Lake and the loss of 17 lives could have been prevented if the NTSB’s recommendations dating as far back as 1999 had been adopted and enforced.
“These common-sense safety measures are needed today to protect more families from experiencing the same tragic end. It is in your power to ensure ‘duck boat’ is not synonymous with ‘floating metal death trap.’ The NTSB recommendations would have protected the families on board Stretch Duck 7 and the Miss Majestic. I urge you to act immediately to adopt and enforce the NTSB recommendations.”
Senator Hawley has
introduced legislation
to improve the safety of duck boats based on the NTSB’s
recommendations
following a duck boat accident in 1999, including commonsense provisions to require the use of life jackets and equipping all operating duck boats to be more buoyant in the case of emergency flooding.
Full text of the letter is available
here
and below.
Admiral Karl L. Schultz
Commandant
United States Coast Guard
2703 Martin Luther King Jr Ave SE
Washington, DC 20020
Dear Admiral Schultz:
On July 19, 2018, Table Rock Lake claimed the lives of seventeen of the thirty-one individuals on board Stretch Duck 7, a DUKW amphibious passenger vessel (APV) operated by Ride the Ducks. The victims, nine of whom were from the same family, ranged in age from one to seventy and drowned when the vessel sank rapidly in a storm. This tragic event should never have occurred.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation and released a fourteen-page report on November 6, 2019, Improving Vessel Survivability and Passenger Emergency Egress of DUKW Amphibious Passenger Vessels. In the report, the NTSB provided two recommendations that would have prevented the incident on Table Rock Lake:
[1]
Require DUKW amphibious passenger vessels to have sufficient reserve buoyancy through passive means, so that they can remain upright and afloat with a full complement of passengers and crewmember in the event of damage or flooding. (M-19-15)
For DUKW amphibious passenger vessels without sufficient reserve buoyancy, require the removal of canopies, side curtains, and their associated framing during waterborne operations to improve emergency egress in the event of sinking. (M-19-16)
Sadly, these recommendations are hardly new. After a similar incident occurred in 1999 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, resulting in the deaths of thirteen of the twenty-one passengers on board, the NTSB authored a seventy-three-page report regarding the incident. In this report, similar recommendations were issued.
[2]
Those recommendations were conveyed to Admiral James M. Loy, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard at the time, via a letter on May 2, 2002.
[3]
In a response dated September 5, 2002, the U.S. Coast Guard concluded that they did not concur with each of the recommendations and did not intend to take further action.
[4]
As a result, the U.S. Coast Guard has not yet adequately address the risks identified through the inspection, certification, or operation of duck boats following the 1999 tragedy.
In conjunction with the November 13, 2019 report, Robert L. Sumwalt, Chairman of the NTSB, stated, “lives could have been saved, and the Stretch Duck 7 accident could have been prevented had previously issued safety recommendations been implemented. The NTSB’s 1999 investigation of another DUKW, the Miss Majestic, also identified the lack of reserve buoyancy and the dangers of canopies as safety issues. Twenty years later, the same risk exists on these vessels and that is unacceptable. It is imperative that the United States Coast Guard adopt these life-saving recommendations now.”
[5]
Sumwalt continued, “The NTSB believes the failure to implement previous safety recommendations related to reserve buoyancy for DUKWs contributed to the sinking of the Stretch Duck 7. Similarly, the failure to implement the previously issued recommendation concerning fixed canopies, following the fatal, 1999 Miss Majestic DUKW accident, likely increased the number of fatalities resulting from Stretch Duck 7 sinking.”
As you know, the NTSB investigation continued until finally coming to a close at a board meeting on April 28, 2020 where the investigative team presented on the findings. The NTSB issued a final Marine Accident Report detailing their findings and voted unanimously to adopt three additional recommendations for the U.S. Coast Guard addressing contributing factors to the tragedy:
[6]
Require that amphibious passenger vessels equipped with forward hatches enable operators to securely close them during waterborne operations to prevent water ingress. (M-20-1)
Review the circumstances of the Stretch Duck 7 sinking and other amphibious passenger vessel accidents, and revise Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 1-01 to address the issues found in these accidents, including operations during imminent severe weather and emergency egress during rapid sinking. (M-20-2)
Examine existing training and knowledge requirements for understanding and applying fundamental weather principles to waterborne operations for Coast Guard- credentialed masters who operate small passenger vessels; and, if warranted, require additional training requirements for these ratings on recognition of critical weather situations in pre-departure planning and while under way. (M-20-3)
While I was encouraged to see the U.S. Coast Guard did not ignore these previously issued recommendations for a second time, these changes should have happened years ago. Ignoring the recommendations again is unacceptable. The time for “consideration” of further safety measures, as indicated in Marine Safety Information Bulletin 15-20, is long overdue and there is no reason to delay further.
[7]
These common-sense safety measures are needed today to protect more families from experiencing the same tragic end. It is in your power to ensure “duck boat” is not synonymous with “floating metal death trap”.
The NTSB recommendations would have protected the families on board Stretch Duck 7 and the Miss Majestic. I urge you to act immediately to adopt and enforce the NTSB recommendations.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Confront China’s Human Rights Abuses
Date: Friday, May 15, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined his colleagues in passing the “Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act,” introduced by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) to confront the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) abuses of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, China.
The bill requires that U.S. policy toward China be explicitly linked to human rights violations in Xinjiang by directing the President to impose sanctions related to the CCP’s treatment of Uyghurs and requiring the FBI to report on efforts to protect Uyghurs and Chinese nationals living in the U.S. from CCP intimidation and harassment.
Senator Hawley,
an original cosponsor of the bill, said
:
“For too long, the Chinese Communist Party has gotten away with imprisoning over a million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in its concentration camps. Passing this bill shines the light on the Party’s human rights abuses and makes sure those responsible for the Uyghurs’ persecution do not go unpunished.”
The Senator and his colleagues also
sent a letter
to the U.S. Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce last year urging them to levy sanctions against those responsible for the Xinjiang concentration camps.
The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 would
Update U.S. policy towards China to be explicitly linked to the situation in Xinjiang.
Direct the President to impose visa and property blocking sanctions related to China’s treatment of the Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim Turkic ethnic group. Includes a Presidential waiver on U.S. national interest grounds.
Require a report from Secretary of State on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, including an assessment of the number of individuals detained in forced labor camps.
Require a report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on efforts to protect ethnic Uyghurs and Chinese nationals legally residing in the United States from Chinese government intimidation or harassment within the United States.
Require reports from the Director of National Intelligence on (1) security and economic threats caused by the Chinese government’s crackdown and policies against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang province, the frequency with which other governments are forcibly returning Turkic Muslim refugees and asylum seekers to China, and the development or transfer of technology that facilitates mass internment and surveillance, and (2) the ability of the USG to collect and analyze intelligence regarding to the scope and scale of the detention and forced labor of Uyghurs.

Title: Hawley, Gardner Partner on Coronavirus Economic Recovery Plan to Put Workers First
Date: Thursday, May 14, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) have announced they will team up on a plan, Rehire America, to help workers and businesses recover and strengthen over the coming months. The proposal calls for Congress to incentivize rehiring workers who were laid off due to the pandemic and support a percent of wages for each worker currently on payroll through the end of the year. The proposal also calls for Congress to provide grants for rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and other fixed costs based on historic revenues.
“The number one priority right now needs to be jobs. People don’t want to be sidelined in the unemployment line. They want work. If the government created stay-at-home guidelines, then the government owes it to the American people to help get them their jobs back. Our economy will continue to hemorrhage unless Congress gets serious about ways to rehire workers and get Americans working again. That’s the urgent need, and that’s the focus of our plan.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“The necessary public health actions we’ve taken to stop the spread of COVID-19 have caused an unprecedented strain on workers and businesses in Colorado and all across our country,”
said Senator Gardner. “The bold steps Congress took in the CARES Act provided an essential lifeline during our economic hibernation. But without additional support, it’s possible that many jobs will never come back and many businesses will never reopen. Rehire America proposes a flexible program to meet the evolving needs of businesses and help American workers get through this crisis. More must be done, and we must think big as we continue to search for solutions to help the American people through this pandemic.”
Hawley-Gardner Rehire America Proposal
America now faces the greatest economic crisis in living memory. Last month, the economy shed 20.5 million jobs, more than double the number lost during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The official unemployment rate now stands at 14.7 percent. Many states are poised to begin the slow work of reopening their economies in the weeks to come, but they do so facing uncertain prospects. Consumption patterns for the industries most affected by the coronavirus lockdowns are unlikely to return to normal in the short term, and we may soon see the ripple effects in comparatively unaffected industries.
Workers and businesses are in a bind. They can’t remain frozen in place for a year, but they lack the financial security they need to restore operations in an uncertain environment. Without further federal action, America’s reopening will stall. Congress must act now to provide the economy the scaffolding it needs to reopen and build the growth curve back up.
Rehire America
To overcome challenges with uncertain revenues and possible worker reluctance to fully join the workforce again, Congress should provide wage support through the end of the year for businesses facing revenue shortfalls:
Rehiring incentives
: To help businesses staff up and get unemployment down, the federal government should provide temporary payroll support of 120 percent of a rehired employee’s wages, capped at $50,000 per employee. This would help businesses offer temporary wage increases to rehired workers to offset the difference between prior wages and pandemic unemployment. This temporary bonus should also cover newly hired workers to allow businesses that have survived the lockdowns to hire workers laid off from businesses that cannot reopen.
Any changes to the accounts of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds resulting from the delivery of this support via the payroll tax system would be fully offset through general revenue transfers, holding our nation’s retirement programs harmless.
Baseline wage support
: Similarly, for businesses with revenue shortfalls, the federal government should pay up to 80 percent of wages for each worker currently on payroll, capped at $50,000 per employee and remitted to employers on an advance basis. Payroll support would be delivered through the payroll tax system as a “negative” payroll tax.
Turning on the Lights
Businesses can’t rehire their workers if they can’t pay their bills, and for many industries the road back to normal could be a long one. In addition to payroll support, Congress should provide businesses grants applicable to rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and other fixed costs based on historic revenues.
In addition to these fixed costs, businesses operating in the pandemic economy need financing to make the substantial investments necessary to keep their workers and customers safe, attract new customers, and experiment with new business models. These investments will help not only to make these firms more productive but also to fuel demand throughout the economy as consumer demand slowly ramps up. To further induce businesses to reopen and rehire, Congress should provide an additional reinvestment credit offsetting these business investment costs.
Eligibility
These new credits should be made available to businesses of all sizes, including small businesses that have received Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness once they have exhausted that support, so long as they have experienced revenue declines of 20 percent or greater. Support will be capped at the level of a business’ revenue losses. To ease administration of the credit, verification of revenue losses and reconciliation of overpayment will occur in 2021 for small and mid-size businesses.

Title: Hawley, Cortez Masto Celebrate Senate Passage of Bipartisan Bill to Help Reduce Police Officer Suicides
Date: Thursday, May 14, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (D-Mo.) joined Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) in applauding the Senate passage of the Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, a bipartisan bill to track law enforcement suicides. The bill would require the FBI to collect voluntary, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to better target interventions and provide assistance.
“Now more than ever, it is essential that we get our law enforcement officers the support they deserve as they put their lives on the line to keep us safe. With better data collection on law enforcement suicides, we can more effectively intervene where help is needed and stop these tragedies before they occur. I’m proud to have led this bill with Senator Cortez Masto in the Senate and to see it pass the chamber during National Police Week, and I hope it will soon become law.”
“Our law enforcement officers are on the frontlines every day protecting Nevada’s communities, and the stressors they face have only been compounded by the heroic work they are doing to keep Nevadans safe during the coronavirus pandemic,”
said Senator Cortez Masto. “This legislation will help us better understand the unique mental health needs of our first responders and provide much-needed guidance, resources and support for the officers who risk their health and safety to serve us. I’m grateful for my colleague Senator Hawley for working with me on this important issue and his effort to pass these this critical bill. I’ll continue to fight to ensure the law enforcement community can get the quality care they need, without unnecessary burdens or fear of stigma.”
Read the full text of the bill here.
Background
2018 was the third straight year in which police suicides outnumbered line-of-duty deaths. Law enforcement agencies across the country lost at least 167 officers to suicide in 2018. Currently, there is no comprehensive government effort to track suicides and attempted suicides in law enforcement like there is for line-of-duty deaths.
The Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act requires the FBI to open a voluntary data collection program to track suicides and attempted suicides within local, tribal, state and federal law enforcement. Information collected and maintained by the FBI will not include any personally identifiable information.
Participating law enforcement agencies will report information on suicides within their agency to the FBI, including:
Circumstances and events that occurred before each suicide or attempted suicide;
Location of each suicide or attempted suicide;
Demographic information of each law enforcement officer who dies by suicide or attempts suicide;
Occupational category for each law enforcement officer who dies by suicide or attempts suicide; and
Method used in each suicide or attempted suicide.
This bill also directs the FBI Director to submit an annual report on the data to Congress and publish the report on the FBI website.
This program would serve as the principal data collection tool on suicides and attempted suicides within law enforcement across the country. By providing accurate and detailed information on these suicides and attempted suicides, more effective prevention programs could be implemented to save lives.

Title: Hawley, Fischer, and Colleagues Call for DOJ Antitrust Investigation into Beef Packers
Date: Tuesday, May 12, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in writing a
letter
to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) calling for an antitrust investigation into the highly concentrated beef packing sector.
“Cattlemen across America seriously question the ability for their children to take over what are frequently multi-generational, family-owned operations that have served as the engines for their communities and our country’s food supply,”
the senators write.
“The precarious market situation for feeders and producers could lead to a widespread collapse of this entire industry, making it susceptible to the forces of vertical integration, which may beset the industry far more quickly than once anticipated. It is critical for the DOJ to act expediently to investigate these concerning circumstances and evaluate potential competitive harm.”
Along with Senators Hawley and Fischer, the letter was signed by Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Kevin Cramer, (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and John Thune (R-S.D.).
Senator Hawley
has also asked for
the Federal Trade Commission to open an antitrust investigation into the meatpacking industry amid plant closures. Following that letter, President Trump requested the DOJ, which has criminal antitrust jurisdiction,
open an investigation into the matter, as well.
Full text of the letter is available
here
or below.
Dear Attorney General Barr,
We have heard growing concerns from cattle producers and feeders in our states about troubling practices in the cattle industry that the COVID-19 national emergency has intensified, including allegations of market manipulation and coordinated behavior harmful to competition. These serious claims have been relayed in a request for further inquiry by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) from eleven state attorneys general this past week, in addition to a number of letters from Senators on the matter. We support these calls to action and request that the DOJ investigate suspected price manipulation and anticompetitive behavior in the highly concentrated cattle industry, in order to identify more clearly the factors contributing to a dire situation for producers.
The lack of competition in the meatpacking industry has resulted in a vulnerable beef supply chain, which the current national emergency has destabilized further. Recent pricing discrepancies between fed cattle and boxed beef are pushing cattle producers and feeders to the brink, adding to the longstanding concerns stemming from the state of competition among beef packers. Since February, we have seen live cattle prices slump by more than 18 percent, while wholesale beef prices have increased by as much as 115 percent during the same period.
Although Congress acted to address the problematic conduct that was commonplace in the meat packing industry a century ago, consolidation has significantly increased in the industry since then. The four major beef packing companies, controlling over 80 percent of the cattle industry and with the advantage of thousands of producers from which to get their supply, effectively function as a chokepoint for the entire industry. Given the critical nature of their operations, the Big 4 packers have a massive dominance in the marketplace that limits opportunity for pricing negotiations in what should be a healthy, competitive marketplace. This is an untenable power imbalance.
We remain concerned about the heightened allegations of suppressed prices for cattle, especially considering how coordinated conduct is facilitated more easily by high market concentration. Furthermore, with so few packers, it makes it far more difficult to assess what is customary within the industry and distinguish reasonable practices. While several different types of conduct can come together to distort this highly concentrated market, we urge the DOJ to review the many dynamics at play here, including the allegations of price manipulation and actions taken to restrict competition.
We recognize that antitrust enforcement alone cannot wholly reshape the industry. However, antitrust laws do have a critical influence in keeping markets competitive as we seek to address the complex issues facing America’s livestock industry during this pandemic. Guided by both the Sherman and Clayton Acts, in addition to the Packers & Stockyards Act, the DOJ’s enforcement responsibility is key to ensure market manipulation and anticompetitive conduct do not interfere with competitive market forces within the beef supply chain.
Given the opaqueness of this concentrated industry, DOJ is in a distinct position to gather the facts and evidence necessary to determine the forms of collusion or other unfair and deceptive practices that might exist behind identical prices or certain buying and selling patterns among packers. We are greatly encouraged to see the momentum at the state level displayed by the coalition of eleven state attorneys general who wrote to the DOJ on May 5, 2020. We also respectfully request that the DOJ collaborate with our state antitrust enforcers to inform comprehensive efforts at both the federal and state levels for careful examination of the cattle industry’s competitive dynamics.
Cattlemen across America seriously question the ability for their children to take over what are frequently multi-generational, family-owned operations that have served as the engines for their communities and our country’s food supply. The precarious market situation for feeders and producers could lead to a widespread collapse of this entire industry, making it susceptible to the forces of vertical integration, which may beset the industry far more quickly than once anticipated. It is critical for the DOJ to act expediently to investigate these concerning circumstances and evaluate potential competitive harms.
We appreciate your prompt consideration of this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley Joins Bipartisan Letter Urging Congressional Leaders to Support Pork Producers During Pandemic
Date: Monday, May 11, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley sent a
bipartisan letter
with 13 of his Senate colleagues to Congressional leaders seeking additional funding for programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that would assist pork producers who are being forced to depopulate livestock herds because of restaurant and meat processing plant closures during the pandemic. Farmers are facing an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding and the challenge of providing enough feed and water available to each animal. There are pigs in various stages of the six month growth process that have nowhere to go.
“The crisis is immediate. Pork producers send to market over two million pigs each week. If twenty percent of processing is idle, that means somewhere around 400,000 animals per week must be disposed of in some manner other than processing. Accordingly, government support is needed in the management of a sensible depopulation of the herd until plant operations stabilize.”
“Given these significant social and economic consequences, we must prioritize funding to indemnify producers who are depopulating herds due to processing plant closures. Assistance is needed for humane euthanization and disposal which will require the coordination of the human, animal, and environmental health communities,”
the senators continued.
Senator Hawley has also
asked the Federal Trade Commission
to open an antitrust investigation into the meatpacking industry amid plant closures due to coronavirus.
The letter to Congressional leaders was signed by Senator Hawley along with Sens. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).
Full text of the letter can be found
here
and below.
Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Majority Leader McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer:
As the Senate considers legislation relevant to the coronavirus outbreak, we ask that you consider funding programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that would assist pork producers who are being forced to depopulate pig herds due to closures of processing facilities.
After enduring extended trade disputes, U.S. hog farmers were poised to be profitable this year with expectations of climbing prices amid increasing domestic and foreign demand. Instead, restaurant closures due to the coronavirus will contribute to industry losses this year conservatively estimated at more than $5 billion.
Now, processing plants are either shutting down or dramatically curtailing production due to outbreaks of COVID-19 within their workforce. Depending on the week, over 40% of processing capacity has been idled. This number is likely to grow, based on current reports, if no action is taken.
Plants are not expected to reopen until improved safety measures – as dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and in conjunction with local authorities – are implemented on the production line, including providing proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to employees. Without proper safety measures in place, workers in the plants will remain at a high risk at contracting the virus. Failure to ensure workplace safety at these plants could result in an even greater backlog on the farm.
The downstream impact of idled plants is full farms, creating an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding and the challenge of providing enough feed and water available to each animal. There are pigs in various stages of the six month growth process that have nowhere to go. If processing plants are idled, then there is an immediate need to establish processes whereby some portion of the herd is humanely euthanized to prevent animal suffering. Failure to have a sensible and orderly process for thinning the herd will lead to animal health issues, environmental issues, and pork producers going out of business. Producers need assistance now if we are to have a sustainable supply of pork in the future.
The crisis is immediate. Pork producers send to market over two million pigs each week. If twenty percent of processing is idle, that means somewhere around 400,000 animals per week must be disposed of in some manner other than processing. Accordingly, government support is needed in the management of a sensible depopulation of the herd until plant operations stabilize.
Given these significant social and economic consequences, we must prioritize funding to indemnify producers who are depopulating herds due to processing plant closures. Assistance is needed for humane euthanization and disposal which will require the coordination of the human, animal, and environmental health communities.
Authority for programs at USDA to help with the consequences of closed processing facilities should be authorized as quickly as possible. Thank you for your consideration of these requests.

Title: Senator Hawley Releases Commencement Video to the College of the Ozarks and to the Class of 2020
Date: Sunday, May 10, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released a video commencement address for the College of the Ozarks and the Class of 2020. Senator Hawley was scheduled to give the commencement address to College of the Ozarks’ Class of 2020 today. Due to commencement being cancelled, Senator Hawley released a video for the students.
“If this emergency is taking things from us, from you, maybe it’s also revealing something to us worth considering about our lives and our life together,”
Senator Hawley said.
“Turning points like graduation reveal to us a bedrock truth about our lives. We are not meant to be alone. We don’t become who we are alone. Our accomplishments are not ours alone. Our hardships and our heartaches are not ours to bear alone. We were made to be together, and we are who we are because of those who have loved us and whose love has empowered us to give and to serve in return.”

Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
called out
House Democrats for proposing over one trillion dollars in new spending for coronavirus relief without including any provisions to protect workers or get them their jobs back, according to
Axios reporting.
Senator Hawley has
proposed a plan
to rehire every worker laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic and protect existing jobs.
So Dems are going to propose over a trillion in new spending but nothing to get workers their jobs back? Nothing to protect jobs now? Doesn’t sound like recovery. Sounds like a boondoggle

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Bipartisan Call for the FTC to Launch Major Children’s Privacy Investigation
Date: Friday, May 08, 2020

Content:
Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) today wrote to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging it to use its authority under the FTC Act to launch an investigation into children’s data practices in the educational technology and digital advertising sectors. The Senators make their request following the Commission’s announcement that it will begin an ahead-of-schedule review of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule and as kids’ technology use and media consumption has skyrocketed during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Children are a uniquely vulnerable population that deserve heighten privacy protections. The FTC should take extreme caution not to weaken – either purposefully or inadvertently – privacy protections under COPPA. In order to ensure that the COPPA Rule review benefits young users, the FTC should use its statutory power to uncover critical information about evolving and widespread threats to children’s privacy that warrant further protections.”
A copy of the Senators’ letter can be found
here.
In their letter, the Senators highlight the lack of public information regarding the ways companies collect and process children’s personal information and urge the FTC to use its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act to develop a clear understanding of current industry practices as “an essential step in the COPPA Rule review.” Questions that should be covered in the FTC’s investigation include:
What personal data educational technology services and providers collect from children and teens;
How they obtain consent for this collection;
How long they retain students’ data and what their process is for deleting student data;
Whether they offer incentives for schools to integrate their products and services into their systems, and whether they offer incentives, such as financial discounts, for adults to consent to children’s data collection;
What third parties they work with to collect and process children’s information;
Whether they sell or share children’s data, including to affiliated companies and data brokers;
Whether they use geolocation information for marketing to children, and if so, how they do so; and
How they collect and process children’s biometric information, including facial recognition data.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Urge President Trump To Expand and Extend Immigration Suspension
Date: Thursday, May 07, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in sending a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to suspend all new guest worker visas for sixty days and to suspend certain categories of new guest worker visas for at least the next year or until unemployment has returned to normal levels.
“As you know, more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment coverage just since mid-March, and approximately one-fifth of the American workforce is currently out of work. This is a stunning difference compared with the historically-low nationwide unemployment rate of just 3.5 percent in February this year. The United States admits more than one million nonimmigrant guest workers every year, and there is no reason to admit most such workers when our unemployment is so high.”
The senators call for:
A suspension of new guest worker visas for sixty days.
A suspension all nonimmigrant guest worker visas for the next sixty days, followed by a continued suspension of new nonimmigrant guest workers for one year or until national unemployment figures return to normal levels.
A suspension of the EB-5 immigrant visa program, effective immediately (EB-5) were exempt in the original EO.
The full text of the letter can be found
here
or below.
Dear President Trump:
We write today regarding employment-based immigration into the United States during our country’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, we write to urge you to suspend all new guest worker visas for sixty days, and to suspend certain categories of new guest worker visas for at least the next year, or until unemployment has returned to normal levels. These suspensions are critical to protecting American workers as our economy gets back on its feet.
While economic shutdowns in states and localities across the country have been necessary to reduce the spread of this pandemic, the results have been devastating for businesses and workers alike. As you know, more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment coverage just since mid-March, and approximately one-fifth of the American workforce is currently out of work. This is a stunning difference compared with the historically-low nationwide unemployment rate of just 3.5 percent in February this year. The United States admits more than one million nonimmigrant guest workers every year, and there is no reason to admit most such workers when our unemployment is so high.
Many businesses have had no choice but to lay off their employees or shutter altogether, and it is unclear when those businesses that survived will be able to rehire their lost employees. Given the extreme lack of available jobs for American job-seekers as portions of our economy begin to reopen, it defies common sense to admit additional foreign guest workers to compete for such limited employment. Your Presidential Proclamation on April 22, 2020, suspending most immigrant visas for sixty days, is a good step in the right direction. However, our guest worker programs—which were outside the scope of that order—remain a serious threat to the U.S. labor market’s recovery.
Of course, we think all Americans share the hope that our economic recovery will be swift, with Americans returning to work in massive numbers as soon as it is safe to do so. Unfortunately, it will likely take some time for most businesses to begin generating enough revenue to return to pre-pandemic levels. That is why, to protect unemployed Americans in the early stages of economic recovery, we urge you to suspend all nonimmigrant guest worker visas for the next sixty days. Exceptions to this suspension should be rare, limited to time-sensitive industries such as agriculture, and issued only on a case-by-case basis when the employer can demonstrate that they have been unable to find Americans to take the jobs.
After sixty days, we urge you to continue to suspend new nonimmigrant guest workers for one year or until our national unemployment figures return to normal levels, whichever comes first. That suspension should, at a minimum, include H-2B visas (nonagricultural seasonal workers), H-1B visas (specialty occupation workers), and the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program (extension of foreign student visas after graduation). We also urge you to suspend the EB-5 immigrant visa program, effective immediately.
There are millions of high school and college students who, if not for the coronavirus pandemic, would be walking across a graduation stage in front of their families and friends over the next few weeks. Instead of celebrating their hard work, most will be receiving their diplomas in the mail while worrying about whether they will be able to find a job in this market. For many high school graduates and college students, they will spend the next few weeks at home making tough decisions about delaying or foregoing college this fall due to their limited family resources. There is no reason why these young people, especially, should not have access to seasonal, nonagricultural work such as summer resort employment or landscaping before those positions are given to imported foreign labor under the H-2B program.
Likewise, there is no reason why unemployed Americans and recent college graduates should have to compete in such a limited job market against an influx of additional H-1B workers, most of whom work in business, technology, or STEM fields. Temporarily suspending the issuance of new H-1B visas would also protect the hundreds of thousands of H-1B workers and their families already working in the United States—workers who could otherwise be subject to deportation if they are laid off for more than 60 days. Of course, appropriate exceptions could also be crafted to the H-1B program suspension to allow for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who wish to come to the United States to assist in combating the coronavirus pandemic.
Additionally, the United States ought to suspend its Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows foreign students in the United States to extend their stay in the United States after graduation for 1-3 years to get “experience in the field” by taking jobs here in the United States. In 2019, more than 223,000 former foreign students had their OPT applications approved or extended. While the merits of such a program are subject to debate, there is certainly no reason to allow foreign students to stay for three additional years just to take jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans as our economy recovers.
Finally, in regards to your Presidential Proclamation issued on April 22, 2020, we write to urge you to remove the exemption for the EB-5 program, at least until real reforms are adopted. The EB-5 program has long been plagued by scandal and fraud, and has been criticized as effectively functioning as a pay-for-citizenship scheme in many cases. There is no reason that the EB-5 program should receive preferential treatment as opposed to other green card programs for employment-based immigrants.
The coronavirus pandemic has wrought terrible damage on our country, and we will likely continue to experience the economic effects of social distancing and shutdown measures for years to come. We applaud your work to protect public health and limit the spread of the virus in the United States, and to find ways to reopen our economy safely. As we work toward recovery, we urge you to keep the American worker in mind and limit the importation of unnecessary guest workers while American families and businesses get back on their feet.
Sincerely,
Tom Cotton
Ted Cruz

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Joint Resolution to Withdraw from WTO
Date: Thursday, May 07, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a
joint resolution
to withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Earlier this week, Senator Hawley penned an
op-ed in the
New York Times
calling for the United States to lead the way to abolishing the WTO as the Chinese Communist Party has weaponized the WTO to its benefit at the expense of American workers.
“The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep, long-standing flaws in our global economic system that demand reform. International organizations like the W.T.O. have enabled the rise of China and benefitted elites around the globe while hollowing out American industry, from small towns to once-thriving urban centers. We need to return production to America, secure critical supply chains, and encourage domestic innovation. Pulling out of the W.T.O. is a good first step.”
Senator Hawley
The joint resolution is available
here.
Background
In 1994, Congress passed
HR 5110 Uruguay Round Agreements Act
(URAA) that established the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 125 of URAA requires a report to Congress every 5 years on the effects of the WTO on the United States economy and provides for a joint resolution to revoke Congressional approval of the United States’ participation in the WTO within 90 days of the report being received.

Title: Senator Hawley to United Airlines: Keep Your Promises to Workers or Give CARES Act Money Back
Date: Friday, May 01, 2020

Content:
On the same day United Airlines announced a cut to 15,000 employees’ hours, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz demanding the company reverse the decision or return the generous taxpayer-funded bailout it received from the CARES Act. United’s announcement to employees comes just over a month after they
assured employees
that they “will not conduct involuntary furloughs or pay cuts in the U.S. before September 30th.”
In the letter, Senator Hawley writes, “During such a severe economic crisis, it is critical that our own corporations act as responsible stewards over their respective workforces. Decisions by major employers like United Airlines can reverberate widely across the labor market, affecting communities and working families alike. The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honor this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ.”
Senator Hawley’s letter comes after
hearing from multiple airline employees
about their hours being cut on his flight from Missouri back to Washington.
The letter is available
here
and below.
May 1, 2020
Mr. Oscar Munoz
Chief Executive Officer
United Airlines, Inc.
PO Box 06649
Chicago, IL 60606-0649
United States
Dear Mr. Munoz:
It has come to my attention that United Airlines will be cutting pay for some workers this month. Recently at an airport, I was approached by several of your employees who shared this news directly with me. During such a severe economic crisis, actions like these by large corporations who have themselves received billions in taxpayer dollars are outrageous. I urge you to reverse this decision immediately. You must keep your promises to your workers or give the money back.
While I appreciate the extraordinary circumstances under which the airline industry must now operate, it is also true that Congress made a special dispensation for the airlines under the recently-passed CARES Act. The airlines were effectively alone in receiving an industry-specific bailout to help maintain operations. This was done in part through the Payroll Support Program, a scheme in which the federal government would directly finance airline payroll through grants. United Airlines recently struck an agreement with the Department of the Treasury for a $5 billion payout, $3.5 billion of which would not need to be returned to taxpayers. Congress provided even more support for airlines like yours in the form of direct financing and loans.
Under the Payroll Support Program, Congress specifically forbade recipients of this taxpayer money from reducing the rate of pay or benefits for workers. Yet, United Airlines recently announced that working hours would be reduced by 25% for approximately 15,000 workers, effectively forcing a layoff to part-time status. It was not the intention of Congress that recipients of this taxpayer money would then turn around and disguise pay reductions by cutting hours.
This is not to mention your own promise to your employees. When the CARES Act passed, you announced that “United will not conduct involuntary furloughs or pay cuts in the U.S. before September 30th.” Anyone who has spent time on hourly payroll knows that a steep reduction in working hours results in a sharp pay cut, which immediately impacts any benefits that are tied to hours worked. There is no other way to spin it.
During such a severe economic crisis, it is critical that our own corporations act as responsible stewards over their respective workforces. Decisions by major employers like United Airlines can reverberate widely across the labor market, affecting communities and working families alike. The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honor this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ.
I look forward to your announcement that you will fully reverse the decision you communicated to workers today, and restore full working hours to all employees who have been affected. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S Senator

Title: Sens. Hawley, Cruz Call for Ban on U.S. Officials Using Tencent, Huawei, ZTE, Other Chinese Communist Party-Backed Platforms
Date: Friday, May 01, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in introducing the
Countering Chinese Attempts at Snooping Act
(CCAS) to prohibit U.S. federal employees from conducting official business on platforms run by Tencent, Huawei, ZTE, and other companies the State Department determines cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In light of the United Nations’ (UN)
recent consideration
of a partnership with Tencent, the CCAS Act also ensures U.S. taxpayer dollars are not used to fund UN contracts with any such companies.
“The United Nations’ decision to partner with Tencent, a glorified surveillance arm of the Chinese Communist Party, is stupid and dangerous. Chinese technology companies like Tencent and Huawei actively conspire with the CCP to conduct international surveillance and present an ongoing threat to the United States and our allies. American taxpayer money should not fund UN contracts that benefit the Chinese Communist Party.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“Companies like Tencent and Huawei are espionage operations for the Chinese Communist party, masquerading as telecom companies for the 21st century,”
said Senator Cruz. “Prohibiting the use of these platforms and stopping taxpayer dollars from being used to capitalize Chinese espionage infrastructure are common sense measures to protect American national security. These are just some of the measures we will have to take as the United States reevaluates its relationship with China and the CCP.”
Senator Hawley has previously called for President Trump
to suspend approval of licensees
that allow some U.S. companies to do business with Huawei and
expressed strong concerns
about the United Kingdom’s proposed partnership with the company.
Background
There is a broad consensus that the CCP uses Tencent and similar companies for espionage on foreign persons, including by simply watching traffic as it comes through Chinese-hosted or -facilitated servers. In September 2019, State Department Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Chris Ford
said
:
“Firms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba, and Baidu have no meaningful ability to tell the Chinese Communist Party ‘no’ if officials decide to ask for their assistance – e.g., in the form of access to foreign technologies, access to foreign networks, useful information about foreign commercial counterparties, insight into patterns of foreign commerce, or specific information about the profiles, activity, or locations of foreign users of Chinese-hosted or -facilitated social media, computer or smartphone applications, or telecommunications. Such aid may not necessarily occur routinely, but it certainly can occur – and presumably will – whenever the Party considers this useful and cares to demand it.”
The CCAS Act requires the Secretary of State to create a list of Chinese technology companies that enable the CCP to conduct espionage based on a list of criteria, including enabling surveillance and granting access to networks. Once the list is created, the legislation prohibits U.S. officials from using technology provided by those companies. Additionally, the CCAS Act requires offsets in U.S. payments to the UN equal to the value of the contracts the UN signs with those companies.

Title: Senators Hawley, Baldwin Ask FTC to Open Antitrust Investigation into Meatpackers Amid Plant Closures
Date: Wednesday, April 29, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.)
asked
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an antitrust investigation into the meatpacking industry. The industry is currently dominated by just a handful of large, multinational firms that have concentrated meat processing into fewer and fewer facilities, leaving America’s food supply chain vulnerable to disruptions.
In the bipartisan letter, the Senators note that the closing of three pork plants because of COVID-19 has resulted “in the shutdown of a staggering 15 percent of America’s pork production” at a time when stable supply chains have become more critical than ever.
“As a result, farmers cannot process their livestock—which are costly to maintain—and consumers risk seeing shortages at grocery stores, exacerbating the food insecurity that all too many Americans are currently experiencing. These harms might have been mitigated if the meatpacking industry was less concentrated. The current COVID-19 crisis has exposed the vulnerabilities of American supply chains and the importance of ensuring that, when disaster strikes, America’s food supplies are not in the hands of a few, mostly foreign-based firms.”
They continue, “The FTC has the power to shed light on these growing competition and security problems in our food supply. The Commission should ask probing questions about major meatpacking firms’ conduct, pricing, and contracting, as well as how their commitments to overseas interests impact the U.S. market and national security. Moreover, because a competitive food industry is so critical to the public interest, you should make the findings of any investigation public.”
Full text of the letter is available
here
or below.
April 29, 2020
Federal Trade Commission/
600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W.
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Simons, Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Chopra, Commissioner Slaughter, and Commissioner Wilson:
One of the most effective tools in the FTC’s arsenal is its power to investigate and analyze the practices of specific industries under section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 15 U.S.C. § 46(b). We write to urge you to exercise that authority to investigate the growing concentration in the meatpacking and processing industry, and any anticompetitive behavior resulting from this concentration.
The domination of a select few companies in the American meatpacking industry is cause for serious concern. Four companies process 85 percent of all the beef in the United States: Tyson Foods, Cargill, JBS S.A., and Smithfield Foods.
[1]
Just three of these multinational firms—Tyson Foods from the United States, JBS from Brazil, and Smithfield from the People’s Republic of China—control 63 percent of America’s pork processing.
[2]
This market consolidation has led to the increased concentration of meat production in just a handful of plants. For instance, over the last several decades, the number of slaughterhouses processing more than one million hogs annually has more than doubled: among those slaughterhouses processing more than 50,000 hogs every year, 90% are these “mega-slaughterhouses.”
[3]
Cattle slaughterhouses have also seen increased concentration, with the average number of cattle slaughtered per plant doubling between 1976 and 2006.
[4]
This physical plant concentration, in turn, has undermined the stability of America’s meat supply and become an issue of national security. Following a spate of COVID-19 infections among plant workers, in recent days these oligopolistic companies have closed three pork plants indefinitely, resulting in the shutdown of a staggering 15 percent of America’s pork production.
[5]
As a result, farmers cannot process their livestock—which are costly to maintain—and consumers risk seeing shortages at grocery stores, exacerbating the food insecurity that all too many Americans are currently experiencing. These harms might have been mitigated if the meatpacking industry was less concentrated. The current COVID-19 crisis has exposed the vulnerabilities of American supply chains and the importance of ensuring that, when disaster strikes, America’s food supplies are not in the hands of a few, mostly foreign-based firms.
Yet even before the immediate COVID-19 crisis, the effects of concentration in meatpacking have broadly proven disastrous for America’s farmers, ranchers, and consumers. Between 1980 and 2009, the price a rancher was able to obtain per pound of beef declined from $1.97 to 93 cents (adjusted for inflation).
[6]
Likewise, between 1999 and 2008, real consumer prices for ground beef increased by 24 percent (adjusted for inflation), from a monthly average price of $1.89 a pound in 1999 to $2.34 a pound in 2008.
[7]
And, of course, these numbers assume that all sales took place in good faith, an assumption which may not be warranted: mega-meatpacker JBS was fined in 2018 for underpaying family farmers and ranchers by claiming cattle weighed less than they did.
[8]
Similar dynamics have played out in the hog industry: between 1992 and 2007, hog prices fell by 30% as producers became increasingly concentrated.
[9]
As America begins to look ahead to a post-pandemic future, the FTC has the power to shed light on these growing competition and security problems in our food supply. The Commission should ask probing questions about major meatpacking firms’ conduct, pricing, and contracting, as well as how their commitments to overseas interests impact the U.S. market and national security. Moreover, because a competitive food industry is so critical to the public interest, you should make the findings of any investigation public. 15 U.S.C. § 46(f).
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your action on this urgent issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Requests Criminal Antitrust Investigation of Amazon
Date: Tuesday, April 28, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting the Department of Justice (DOJ) open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon.
Recent reporting
has revealed that Amazon uses its position as an online platform to stifle competition by collecting detailed data on merchandise in order to create rival products under its own brand.
“Abusing one’s position as a marketplace platform to create copycat products always is bad, but it is especially concerning now. Thousands of small businesses have been forced to suspend in-store retail and instead rely on Amazon because of shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon’s reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering.”
Senator Hawley noted that the European Union has already opened a similar investigation into Amazon’s use of data to target third-party sellers and that Amazon’s practices are especially concerning because it can collect far more data than traditional, physical retailers.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
Dear Attorney General Barr:
I write to ask you to open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon. Recent reports suggest that Amazon has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly. These practices are alarming for America’s small businesses even under ordinary circumstances. But at a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses’ very existence.
Antitrust law imposes criminal penalties on companies that try to acquire or maintain monopoly power. Amazon’s data practices, as reported by the Wall Street Journal,
[1]
appear to meet that description. Amazon abuses its position as an online platform and collects detailed data about merchandise so Amazon can create copycat products under an Amazon brand. Internal documents and the testimony of more than 20 former Amazon employees support this finding.
The kind of data Amazon can access poses a much greater threat to competition than the data accessible to ordinary retail stores. Brick-and-mortar stores collect data, such as how often third-party products are purchased, when they are purchased, and whether they are purchased in combination with other products. But online retailers like Amazon can collect so much more data. They can track how long a person’s attention lingers on a product, which features attract a person’s attention, which images a person views and for how long, and what reviews a person reads. Amazon’s capacity for data collection is like a brick-and-mortar retailer attaching a camera to every customer’s forehead.
Amazon appears to recognize that using this data to develop its own merchandise is problematic. Indeed, Amazon insists it has adopted policies prohibiting this conduct. Yet Amazon’s own employees and documents suggest that what Amazon says in its policies and what Amazon does in practice are two different things.
Even if Amazon’s statements are true, they are hardly reassuring. Amazon does not deny that it uses precise, intrusive data to create its own merchandise. It simply claims that the data it uses is aggregate instead of “seller-specific.” But when it comes to anticompetitive data practices, this distinction makes little, if any, difference. The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon used data to make a copycat product even when 99.95% of the original product came from a single seller. Amazon’s aggregate data technically covered two sellers, but it was functionally seller-specific. In any event, aggregate data can still enable Amazon to create or solidify monopoly power. Using aggregate data just means that, when Amazon uses data to create copycat products, it harms multiple small businesses instead of just one.
Abusing one’s position as a marketplace platform to create copycat products always is bad, but it is especially concerning now. Thousands of small businesses have been forced to suspend in-store retail and instead rely on Amazon because of shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon’s reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering.
The European Union already has opened an investigation into reports that Amazon uses data anticompetitively to target third-party sellers. In the light of the enormous evidence already gathered, I ask that you look into this issue and open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Sen. Hawley Writes to Treasury, SBA: Don’t Let Wall Street Greed Undermine Small Biz Loan Program
Date: Tuesday, April 28, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza asking they conduct rigorous oversight of the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program. In the letter Senator Hawley condemns big banks who offered wealthy clients VIP treatment, fast-tracking their applications at the expense of other small businesses who may have applied first.
“In the first round of funding, these unfair practices likely caused many small businesses who applied for assistance to be left out,” Senator Hawley said.
“As you know, big banks are receiving a generous servicing fee by taxpayers for their role in administering this program. They must not take advantage of this incentive by privileging their existing clientele or those with larger loan requests at the expense of small businesses who are in urgent need of financial assistance. Corporate greed on Wall Street cannot be allowed to subvert a program designed to deliver much-needed relief to small businesses to help keep the lights on.”

of below.
April 28, 2020
Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza:
As you work to implement the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), I urge you to be vigilant against unfair practices by the biggest banks in the disbursal of forgivable loans. To ensure that this program is fairly implemented and not exploited, it is imperative that you conduct rigorous oversight.
There have been numerous reports that big banks are giving larger companies and existing clients preferential treatment in the processing of PPP loan applications. According to news reports, some big banks offered wealthy clients in their private wealth divisions concierge treatment, effectively fast-tracking their applications at the expense of other small businesses who may have applied first. These practices are wholly unacceptable and run contrary to both congressional intent and program rules you have released that clarify PPP loans are “first-come, first-served.”
In the first round of funding, these unfair practices likely caused many small businesses who applied for assistance to be left out. As the second round of funding commences, I have heard early reports from smaller lenders in Missouri that the approval process remains exceptionally slow; they also report persistent issues accessing SBA’s E-Tran portal. In light of these reports, I am concerned that big banks and their favored clients—who now have the ability to submit thousands of loan applications as a “bulk file” outside of the normal process—may receive preferential access over smaller lenders.
As you know, big banks are receiving a generous servicing fee by taxpayers for their role in administering this program. They must not take advantage of this incentive by privileging their existing clientele or those with larger loan requests at the expense of small businesses who are in urgent need of financial assistance. Corporate greed on Wall Street cannot be allowed to subvert a program designed to deliver much-needed relief to small businesses to help keep the lights on.
As your agencies work to facilitate the expeditious loan approval under the Paycheck Protection Program, you must work to make oversight of this program a priority to ensure fair implementation. I request a response to the following questions by Monday, May 11:
Have your agencies conducted oversight of those banks and lenders who may have violated the “first-come, first-served” standard and thereby privileged some businesses at the expense of others? If so, will you commit to making such findings public?
What actions do you plan to take to ensure that banks and lenders faithfully follow the “first-come, first-served” standard?
In the second round of funding, will these “bulk file” submissions by larger lenders still be subject to the “first-come, first-served” standard to avoid offering the biggest banks preferential access?
Thank you for your work to ensure that the Paycheck Protection Program is implemented fairly for the benefit of all small businesses in Missouri and across the country.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Blunt Urge Administration to Ensure Smaller Colleges & Universities With Work-Study Programs Are Eligible for CARES Act Funding
Date: Monday, April 27, 2020

Content:
Today, Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration Jovita Carranza urging them to ensure that smaller colleges and universities cannot be disqualified from receiving emergency funding through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) due to their participation in the federal work-study program.
“It has been brought to our attention that federal work-study students are counted in some cases as employees for purposes of PPP. While the CARES Act defines the term ‘employee’ to include ‘individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis,’ congressional intent is to stabilize small businesses and non-profits in order to incentivize keeping employees on their employers’ payroll. This purpose is distinct from that of the federal work-study program, and including those students in the PPP employee count is not congressional intent,”
the senators wrote. “Please use your statutory authority to ensure that institutions of higher education with less than 500 full time employees can use the resources Congress provided to them to weather the coronavirus pandemic. In our state, many of these institutions are faith-based colleges and universities, and they are vital to the Missouri economy.”

The Honorable Steven Mnuchin
Secretary of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest
Washington, DC 20220
The Honorable Jovita Carranza
Administrator of the Small Business Administration
409 3rd Street, Southwest
Washington, DC 20416
Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza,
Thank you for your work implementing and issuing guidance for the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
We write to urge that institutions of higher education with less than 500 full time employees are not disqualified from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) eligibility simply for participating in the federal work-study program.
Created by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, federal work-study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. Participating institutions administer the program and provide a percentage of the share of a student’s wages. The U.S. Department of Education allocates funding for the program, and the program’s purpose is primarily for the benefit of students rather than the institution itself.
It has been brought to our attention that federal work-study students are counted in some cases as employees for purposes of PPP. While the CARES Act defines the term “employee” to include “individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis,” congressional intent is to stabilize small businesses and non-profits in order to incentivize keeping employees on their employers’ payroll. This purpose is distinct from that of the federal work-study program, and including those students in the PPP employee count is not congressional intent. In addition, in Section 3505 of the CARES Act, Congress has made special allowances for the federal work-study program during the pandemic, further underscoring congressional intent that federal work-study be treated in this legislation as a distinct category of work.
Please use your statutory authority to ensure that institutions of higher education with less than 500 full time employees can use the resources Congress provided to them to weather the coronavirus pandemic. In our state, many of these institutions are faith-based colleges and universities, and they are vital to the Missouri economy.
We appreciate your expediency and attention to this pressing matter.

Title: Senator Hawley Announces Bill to Ban Universities from Relief Funds Until Endowments Tapped
Date: Wednesday, April 22, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced legislation to prohibit universities from receiving Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds from the CARES Act if they have an endowment larger than $10 billion, unless they first spend some of their own money on coronavirus-related financial assistance for students.
Under the proposal, universities with over $10 billion in endowments would have to spend 10 times the amount appropriated to them according to the formula in the CARES Act to be eligible for federal relief funds. The university would have to demonstrate it spent the money on the same uses of funds required by the CARES Act – emergency financial aid grants to students to cover costs like food, housing, healthcare and childcare, and costs related to the disruption to the delivery of instruction due to COVID-19.
I’m tired of hearing from university execs that “it wouldn’t be prudent” to tap their endowments in this crisis. Fine. But don’t come begging federal taxpayers for money while you sit on billions in endowment funds and students suffer
— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO)
April 22, 2020
Background
The CARES Act provided nearly $14 billion for higher education institutions through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. 90 percent of these funds were awarded to higher education institutions to be used to cover the cost of changes in delivery of education services due to COVID-19 and to provide emergency financial assistance to students. Funds are allocated based on the number of Pell Grant recipients and overall student enrollment at each institution of higher education.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on Google, Apple CEOs to Commit to be Personally Liable for Protecting Privacy in COVID-19 Response
Date: Tuesday, April 21, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook demanding the executives commit not to hide behind a corporate shield and instead be personally liable for protecting privacy in their contact-tracing project. Senator Hawley raised concerns about whether data collected to trace the spread of COVID-19 would be kept anonymous and whether the companies could be trusted to end the tracking program once the pandemic has ended.
“If you seek to assure the public, make your stake in this project personal. Make a commitment that you and other executives will be personally liable if you stop protecting privacy, such as by granting advertising companies access to the interface once the pandemic is over. The public statements you make now can be enforced under federal and state consumer protection laws. Do not hide behind a corporate shield like so many privacy offenders have before. Stake your personal finances on the security of this project.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley pointed to Google’s admission
during a March 2019 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing
that the company still tracks location history even when a user has turned it off as a cause for skepticism.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
Dear Mr. Pichai and Mr. Cook:
Your recently announced project to respond to COVID–19 by tracking when and where Americans interact with each other raises serious concerns. Especially because of Google’s poor record on privacy, I fear that your project could pave the way for something much more dire.
The possible implications this project could have for privacy are alarming. For example, your materials state that the data necessary for this project will be anonymized. But anonymity in data is notoriously unstable. Data typically can be reidentified simply by cross-referencing it with another data set. Pairing the data from this project with the GPS data that both your companies already collect could readily reveal individual identities.
Worse, when paired with other data sets, the data from this project could create an extraordinarily precise mechanism for surveillance. Both your companies collect GPS data, but the GPS system has significant limits. It works poorly indoors and cannot pinpoint the floor a person is on. Combining the data from this project with GPS data (or other data, such as Wi-Fi positioning), could greatly erode privacy by making precise surveillance much easier.
Americans are right to be skeptical of this project. Even if this project were to prove helpful for the current crisis, how can Americans be sure that you will not change the interface after the pandemic subsides? Once downloaded onto millions of phones, the interface easily could be edited to eliminate previous privacy protections. And any privacy protection that is baked into the interface will do little good if the apps that are developed to access the interface also choose to collect other information, like real-time geolocation data. When it comes to sticking to promises, Google’s record is not exactly reassuring. Last year a Google representative had to admit, under oath, that Google still tracks location history even when a person turns location history off. As the Associated Press put it, “Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.”
A project this unprecedented requires an unprecedented assurance on your part. Too often, Americans have been burned by companies who calculated that the profits they could gain by reversing privacy pledges would outweigh any later financial penalty levied against the company. The last thing Americans want is to adopt, amid a global emergency, a tracking program that then becomes a permanent feature in our lives.
If you seek to assure the public, make your stake in this project personal. Make a commitment that you and other executives will be personally liable if you stop protecting privacy, such as by granting advertising companies access to the interface once the pandemic is over. The public statements you make now can be enforced under federal and state consumer protection laws. Do not hide behind a corporate shield like so many privacy offenders have before. Stake your personal finances on the security of this project.
I look forward to hearing about how you intend to try to provide Americans with assurance.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Urges USDA Secretary Perdue to Establish Emergency Farm-to-Food-Bank Program
Date: Tuesday, April 21, 2020

Content:
Following
reports of farmers destroying healthy produce
due to cratering demand from restaurants and other large buyers, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue calling for immediate funding of a farm-to-food-bank program to get food to those in urgent need.
“I urge you to immediately use a portion of that funding to provide farm-to-food-bank support modeled after the 2018 Farm Bill’s approach, but without the 50% state-contribution requirement. Taking steps to immediately provide for delivery of healthy, farm-fresh produce directly to the people who need it most, rather than allowing commodities to rot in the fields from lack of demand, will ensure that emergency feeding organizations–including faith-based groups providing such services–immediately have the resources necessary to serve the American public during this difficult time.”
Senator Hawley pointed to the 2018 Farm Bill as a model for funding an emergency food assistance program to get produce from agricultural producers to emergency feeding organizations like food banks.
Read the full letter
here
or below.
Dear Secretary Perdue:
As you are no doubt sadly aware, the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have devastated countless American communities. Because of this, thousands of Americans are now experiencing food insecurity, with thousands more likely to find themselves in similar straits as lockdown measures continue and job losses skyrocket. Food banks have reported miles-long lines and widespread shortages of much-needed agricultural commodities. The level of demand for food support is, quite simply, unprecedented.
Even more tragically, while Americans are going hungry, farmers and agricultural producers are being forced to destroy healthy crops because of cratering demand from restaurants. A recent New York Times article described farmers “burying tens of thousands of pounds of onions and leaving them to decompose in trenches,” “dumping thousands of gallons of fresh milk into lagoons and manure pits,” and “smashing 750,000 unhatched eggs every week.”
[1]
Lacking the resources to prepare and distribute their goods, farmers are left with no choice but to destroy perfectly healthy produce. This situation is intolerable.
On April 17, USDA announced its new Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, providing $19 billion in support for agricultural producers and partnering with regional and local distributors to purchase $3 billion worth of fresh produce, dairy, and meat. USDA’s announcement also notes the availability of $873.3 million in Section 32 funding for the purchasing of agricultural products to be delivered to food banks.
While this program is certainly a crucial–and welcome–step, any agricultural purchasing program administered through USDA will take some time to design and deploy. For thousands of Americans experiencing food insecurity, speed is of the essence: they cannot wait until a new purchasing and distribution program is fully operational. So too, farmers and agricultural producers have goods available right now, many of which will spoil if not immediately harvested and brought to consumers.
Fortunately, the 2018 Farm Bill points toward a way forward. That bill allowed the federal government to fund states’ emergency food assistance programs in order to pay for the harvesting, processing, and transportation of commodities donated by agricultural producers, where those commodities will be used by emergency feeding organizations like food banks.
[2]
The CARES Act provided USDA with $9.5 billion in funding to be used at your discretion to support agricultural producers.
[3]
I urge you to immediately use a portion of that funding to provide farm-to-food-bank support modeled after the 2018 Farm Bill’s approach, but without the 50% state-contribution requirement. Taking steps to immediately provide for delivery of healthy, farm-fresh produce directly to the people who need it most, rather than allowing commodities to rot in the fields from lack of demand, will ensure that emergency feeding organizations—including faith-based groups providing such services—immediately have the resources necessary to serve the American public during this difficult time.
To be sure, any regulatory adjustments necessary to permit such farm-to-food-bank interaction cannot compromise food safety. But the federal Farm Bill has already laid out the groundwork for an approach that maintains high standards of quality while ensuring that emergency feeding organizations have ready access to farm-grown produce. I encourage USDA to take whatever regulatory measures are necessary to help make that vision a reality.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

A payroll tax waiver, wage subsidies make most sense as stimulus: Art Laffer, Jon Hartley
Fox Business
April 20, 2020
As we’re already quickly discovering, there are several operational and implementation challenges we’ve encountered while delivering seriously needed trillions of CARES Act relief in a timely manner to the American people amid the
COVID-19
outbreak and economic shutdown.
[. . .]
Why not deliver a faster and less operationally challenging stimulus through the payroll system that will incentivize employers to keep their workers on payroll and for them not to leave?
That is exactly the idea behind a negative payroll tax wage subsidy, which would not only bring the payroll tax to zero (which some argue provides too little relief) but bring it down further to become a direct payroll wage subsidy (or “negative payroll tax”).
Both employers and employees would both receive money from the federal government on a biweekly basis instead of having to pay the government a certain percentage of wages in payroll tax.
The beauty of a payroll tax waiver or payroll subsidy for both employer and employees is that it doesn’t have to go through inefficient government and banking administration which add significant costs.
The CARES Act (Phase 3 stimulus bill) does provide the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a payroll tax credit equal to 50 percent of certain wages paid by eligible employers, with a maximum tax credit of $5,000 per employee.
The spirit of this provision is good but could go much farther.
Along these lines, Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has
now proposed a payroll tax rebate
that covers 80 percent of payroll expenses while
Canada
and the
UK
are now implementing wage subsidies where employees receive 75 percent and 80 percent of their paycheck respectively albeit in the form of tax credits.
A recurring biweekly payroll subsidy (rather than a one-time tax credit) would be faster and likely help boost spending because of what behavioral economists call “mental accounting,” that is people are more likely to spend something that they see as a permanent income boost to their income.
If the payroll tax cut wage subsidy is temporary, it would incentivize people and businesses to work a lot harder right away as they return to work to take advantage of the tax abatement before it disappears, say before the end of the year.
Fast implementation could be achieved quickly with the help of private payroll processing firms like ADP and Paychex.
[. . .]
We hope this idea is something that Congress considers as it decides how to deliver continued economic relief to Americans suffering economically that will also help to aid a fast recovery where employers and employees that were together prior to the crisis stick together.
If not, we may want to keep a payroll tax waiver or negative payroll tax in the policy toolbox for the next time a pandemic or economic crisis rolls around if we want to respond in an even faster manner.

Title: Senator Hawley, Colleagues Call for Financial Security for Rural Communities in Midst of COVID-19 Crisis
Date: Monday, April 20, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined a bipartisan group of senators on a
letter
calling for the Senate to finally provide much-needed financial certainty during the coronavirus pandemic for rural communities to ensure long-term funding needed for essential services.
In a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the senators pushed for,
“a long-term solution for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) and Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) programs at the next possible opportunity.”
“The stop and start authorizations and payments under SRS and PILT have wreaked havoc on rural America for decades, and now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the budgets of these rural counties are decimated. These two programs fund roads, schools, law enforcement, and essential county services, such as public health programs,”
the senators wrote. “With inadequate funding and now additional demands on their resources, rural communities and counties are at the breaking point.”
Senator Hawley joined the letter with Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dan Sullivan (R-Ark.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Kamala D.

Title: Hawley, Blunt, Senators Urge USDA to Provide Assistance to Dairy Farmers Impacted by Coronavirus
Date: Thursday, April 16, 2020

Content:
This week, Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt joined 13 of their Senate colleagues in urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to extend assistance to the dairy industry, which has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As large swaths of the U.S. economy have shuttered in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, so too have long-existing markets for U.S. dairy producers. This standstill has left dairy farmers with excess product that was originally intended for the food service industry and no channel to get their milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt into the hands of consumers.
The senators wrote to Secretary Perdue to request he use the agriculture assistance provisions in the CARES Act to provide stability for the dairy industry and prevent a collapse in farm milk prices.
“In this case assistance for the dairy industry adds up to both help for farmers and nutritious food for the entire country,”
the senators wrote. “Support for Americans suddenly in need of food assistance is a national priority at this time of need. Economic stability for the dairy industry will help ensure that a stable and abundant food supply is available to the public at reasonable prices now and long into the future.”
In addition to Hawley and Blunt, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Jim Risch (Idaho), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Todd Young (Ind.), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Mitt Romney (Utah), John Cornyn (Texas), Joni Ernst (Iowa), John Thune (N.D.), and Steve Daines (Mont.).

The Honorable Sonny Perdue
Secretary
U.S. Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Ave., S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20250
Dear Secretary Perdue:
We thank you for the tremendous amount of time and effort you and the entire team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are bringing to the policy table so that farmers can survive and Americans can keep food on their kitchen table. Our farmers and ranchers are doing their part to help the nation navigate the effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Your work is providing valuable assistance in that partnership you so often refer to in your motto to “Do Right and Feed Everyone.”
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27th includes several provisions for assistance to agriculture. While few sectors of the economy have been spared from the economic impacts of the heroic efforts of Americans to contain the spread of the coronavirus, perhaps none have experienced the loss of markets to the degree of the U.S. dairy industry. For example, products typically sold to dine-in restaurants, that nearly all have closed due to social distancing requirements, are backing up in warehouses and much of the farm milk used to make those products no longer has a market.
Farm milk prices are on the verge of collapse due to this shift in consumer demand. Dairy producers who, just a few weeks ago were looking at the prospect of the first promising year in more than five, are now in the most economic difficulty in memory.
In this case assistance for the dairy industry adds up to both help for farmers and nutritious food for the entire country. Support for Americans suddenly in need of food assistance is a national priority at this time of need. Economic stability for the dairy industry will help ensure that a stable and abundant food supply is available to the public at reasonable prices now and long into the future.
The Congress provided several ways in the CARES Act to help the dairy industry. We urge you to develop strong measures to help mitigate the current market upheaval so that the dairy industry can survive this crisis.

Title: Hawley, Blunt Join Bipartisan Effort Urging USDA to Support Pork Producers
Date: Thursday, April 16, 2020

Content:
Today Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt joined a bipartisan letter urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to take immediate action to assist pork producers and maintain the pork food supply chain.
“We hope this component of the supply chain is restored quickly,”
the members of Congress wrote.  “However, in the event that producers are unable to schedule harvest of their hogs, we request that you consider how to use your existing authorities and available funds to compensate producers for losses. Furthermore, we request that Natural Resource Conservation Service consider how to provide financial and technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for affected producers, if needed.”
The letter follows the closure of Smithfield processing plants in Sioux Falls, S.D. and Martin City, Mo. Missouri processing plants depend on supply chains that cross state borders and Missouri’s local workforce is heavily impacted by closures nationwide.
Joining Senators Hawley and Blunt on the letter were Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mike Rounds, (R-S.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).

We write to bring your attention to the closure of the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, SD and to urge the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take action to assist pork producers and maintain the pork supply chain.
On April 12, 2020, Smithfield Foods announced it will indefinitely close its Sioux Falls plant due to a COVID-19 outbreak. This plant provides approximately 130 million servings of pork per week, and we are concerned about the impact this closure will have not only on the plant employees, but also on the more than 500 independent family farms who supply the plant.
To assist pork producers during this difficult time, we request that USDA conduct pork purchases and provide financial assistance to producers. We request that assistance be provided in an equitable manner that recognizes the various challenges pork producers are facing due to COVID-19 and limits market distortions.
We hope this component of the supply chain is restored quickly. However, in the event that producers are unable to schedule harvest of their hogs, we request that you consider how to use your existing authorities and available funds to compensate producers for losses. Furthermore, we request that Natural Resource Conservation Service consider how to provide financial and technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for affected producers, if needed.
It is critically important that we maintain our pork supply chain to ensure that consumers continue to have access to high-quality pork products in grocery stores and supermarkets throughout the country, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Thank you for your continued efforts to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on U.S. agriculture and for your prompt attention to our request.

Title: Senator Hawley Announces Bill to Hold Chinese Communist Party Responsible for COVID-19 Pandemic
Date: Tuesday, April 14, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the
Justice for Victims of Coronavirus Act
to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) responsible for causing the COVID-19 global pandemic.
The bill would strip China of its sovereign immunity and create a cause of action against the CCP for reckless actions like silencing whistleblowers and withholding critical information about COVID-19. The plan would also create the Justice for Victims of Coronavirus Task Force at the State Department to launch an international investigation into Beijing’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak and to secure compensation from the Chinese government.
“There is overwhelming evidence that the Chinese Communist Party’s lies, deceit, and incompetence caused COVID-19 to transform from a local disease outbreak into a global pandemic. We need an international investigation to learn the full extent of the damage the CCP has inflicted on the world and then we need to empower Americans and other victims around the world to recover damages. The CCP unleashed this pandemic. They must be held accountable to their victims.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley was the first member of Congress to
call for an investigation into the CCP’s cover-up of the COVID-19 pandemic
and recently joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in
introducing the Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act
to authorize sanctions on foreign officials who suppress or distort information about international public health crises.
The
Justice for Victims of Coronavirus Act
will:
Empower American citizens and States to sue the Chinese government for damages by:
Making the Chinese government liable for civil claims in U.S. courts;
Creating a cause of action against the Chinese government for any reckless action it took that caused the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, such as its decisions to withhold information and to gag doctors;
Stripping the Chinese government of sovereign immunity for these actions; and
Giving U.S. courts power to freeze Chinese government assets.
Launch the Justice for Victims of Coronavirus Task Force, which will oversee and coordinate the federal government’s efforts to hold Beijing accountable by:
Leading an international commission to determine fully how Chinese government attempts to conceal the COVID-19 outbreak—including by using the World Health Organization to parrot its lies—contributed to this pandemic; and
Preparing options to force the Chinese government to pay damages to individuals and reimburse governments worldwide for the costs of protecting their citizens and providing relief during the economic crisis that has resulted from this pandemic.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands SBA Immediately Provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans to Small Businesses
Date: Monday, April 13, 2020

Content:
Following
local reports
that small business owners have not received Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) from the Small Business Administration (SBA), U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
sent a letter
to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza demanding the funds be distributed as soon as possible. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the SBA must provide grants of up to $10,000 to businesses within three days of their application to the EDIL program.
“I have heard from many of my constituents who have applied for relief that they have not yet received the emergency advance grant promised by the EIDL program under the CARES Act,”
Senator Hawley wrote.
“You must take action to distribute these emergency advances as quickly as possible and also clarify the expected grant amount for applicants. I further urge that the principal loan amounts be disbursed rapidly and that you work to communicate with applicants as to when they should expect to receive their loans. Small businesses and workers across the country are urgently waiting for this relief to help keep the lights on during this pandemic.”
Read the full text of the letter
here
or below.
Dear Administrator Carranza:
It has come to my attention that applicants are experiencing significant delays with the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. I have heard from many of my constituents who have applied for relief that they have not yet received the emergency advance grant promised by the EIDL program under the CARES Act. As of yesterday, reporting suggests that small businesses across the country have yet to receive these funds. This is concerning and must be rectified immediately.
As you know, Congress included a provision in the CARES Act to allow EIDL applicants to receive an emergency advance grant to allow for immediate relief while applicants waited for their loans to be processed. Section 1110 of the CARES Act is clear that these funds can be used for operating costs, do not need to be paid back, and that applicants can expect that these advances be delivered within three days of submitting an application. Yet many of my constituents have been waiting far longer than this three day period. While I understand that the SBA is processing a surge of applications, it is also incumbent upon you to ensure that these funds are disbursed expeditiously.
Applicants also require clarity about the amount of emergency grant they can expect to receive. Some applicants are also concerned that they may receive less than the $10,000 maximum payment they have requested. It was the intent of Congress that applicants can request up to $10,000 in order to provide immediate relief for their small businesses. Even though this program has high participation and may be in need of more funding by Congress, existing appropriations can and should be distributed to small businesses.
You must take action to distribute these emergency advances as quickly as possible and also clarify the expected grant amount for applicants. I further urge that the principal loan amounts be disbursed rapidly and that you work to communicate with applicants as to when they should expect to receive their loans. Small businesses and workers across the country are urgently waiting for this relief to help keep the lights on during this pandemic. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Brown Call on Mnuchin to Protect Direct Cash Relief from Predatory Debt Collectors
Date: Friday, April 10, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) in sending a letter to Secretary Mnuchin urging immediate action to ensure Americans receive the full amount of their direct payments provided by Congress in the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The letter says Treasury must protect CARES payments from being seized by predatory debt collectors and guarantee that American families get full and immediate direct relief.
“If Treasury fails to take action, the CARES Act direct payments are at risk of being seized by debt collectors. That is not what Congress intended. We came together to pass the CARES Act to help American families pay for food, medicine, and other basic necessities during this crisis. To carry out Congress’s intent and ensure that American families receive the help they need, we ask that you immediately exercise your authority to protect these payments from private debt collectors.”
Senator Hawley was a
leading advocate
of providing direct relief to individuals and families and
fought to include
it in Congress’ Phase 3 relief plan.
A copy of the letter is
here
and below.
The Honorable Steven Mnuchin
Secretary
Department of Treasury
Dear Secretary Mnuchin:
We write to request that the Department of Treasury (Treasury) take immediate action to ensure that American families receive the full amount of the direct payments Congress provided for in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Congress included this critical relief in order to help American families struggling to pay for food, medicine, and other basic necessities during the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting economic crisis.
Under Section 2201 of the CARES Act, Congress provided for “recovery rebates” of up to $1,200 for qualifying individuals, along with an additional $500 per dependent child, to mitigate the financial blow of COVID-19 on our families and economy. To ensure that American families receive the full amount of this intended relief, the CARES Act does not allow for the payment amount to be reduced, or “offset,” for past tax debts or other debts owed to federal or state governments.
[1]
The only offset that Congress allowed is for past due child support payments.
[2]
Treasury has the authority—and must exercise it—to also protect CARES Act direct payments from being seized to satisfy garnishment orders for private debts (except for child support payments). Under current Treasury rules, two months of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, and other federal payments are protected from being garnished by private debt collectors.
[3]
Treasury can also apply this rule to protect the CARES Act direct payments from private debt collectors. Alternatively, Treasury can exercise the authority provided under Section 2201(h) of the CARES Act to issue new rules or guidance to protect the direct payments from private debt collectors.
[4]
If Treasury fails to take action, the CARES Act direct payments are at risk of being seized by debt collectors. That is not what Congress intended. We came together to pass the CARES Act to help American families pay for food, medicine, and other basic necessities during this crisis. To carry out Congress’s intent and ensure that American families receive the help they need, we ask that you immediately exercise your authority to protect these payments from private debt collectors.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Title: Op-Ed: Americans are ready for a comeback. Congress must help unleash it.
Date: Thursday, April 09, 2020

Content:
As published in
The Washington Post
America is experiencing a moment of crisis, but it need not be a period of decline. From our great cities to our rural towns, Americans everywhere are making enormous sacrifices for the sake of their fellow citizens. It is clear from these selfless acts — nurses and physicians working long into the night; delivery workers bringing essential goods to their neighbors’ doors; church groups assembling care packages for the ill — that Americans’ love of country is undimmed and American courage is unshaken. In fact, Americans are ready for a comeback. And Congress must help to unleash it.
The stakes are high. We are in the midst of the greatest health crisis in a century, with an economic crisis to match it. Because of government health measures adopted to fight the virus, millions of Americans have been laid off in a matter of weeks, wiping away years of job gains. Small businesses are struggling to keep the lights on. And lifesaving medical products needed to fight this virus are in short supply.
Now is the time for bold measures to answer this hour’s need and position this nation to surge ahead once the disease is broken.
That is why the next round of
coronavirus
relief legislation is critical. Congress must get it right.
We cannot afford to make a few fixes to existing programs and hope for the best. We must think differently and be bold.
Here is what I propose: Because the government has taken the step of closing the economy to protect public health, Congress should in turn protect every single job in this country for the duration of this crisis. And Congress should help our businesses rehire every worker who has already lost a job because of the coronavirus.
Beginning immediately, the federal government should cover 80 percent of wages for workers at any U.S. business, up to the national median wage, until this emergency is over. Further, it should offer businesses a bonus for rehiring workers laid off over the past month. The goal must be to get unemployment down — now — to secure American workers and their families, and to help businesses get ready to restart as soon as possible.
This approach will prepare us to surge into recovery. Workers will benefit from the steady paycheck and the knowledge that their jobs are safe. And businesses, able to retain their workforce at little cost, will be poised for success once the economy reopens.
We must also move decisively to secure our critical supply chains and bring production back to this country. The present crisis has revealed just how vital domestic production is to our national life. And yet, for decades, an alliance of big government and big business conspired to outsource the manufacturing of our most crucial supplies and equipment to China and other overseas sites.
Now, dangerous shortages of key medical supplies reveal just how self-serving and reckless those decisions were.
It is past time to secure our supply chains by adopting strong local-content requirements for all industries essential to our crisis response, to be phased in when the current emergency ends. These measures should be paired with generous financing for all businesses looking to move back home.
Finally, in an effort to protect our small businesses from a feeding frenzy by bigger firms, Congress must crack down on crisis profiteering by Wall Street. Strong antitrust enforcement and stiffer corporate transparency rules will help to ensure that, when our economy gets moving, we don’t have a wave of mergers and liquidations that set our workers back yet again.
As the stakes mount, some in Congress will no doubt be tempted to fall back on old ideas and programs, such as tweaking the tax code or spending more on pet projects. But that approach is not equal to this moment.
Make no mistake, the cost of addressing this crisis will be substantial: Some economists estimate the price tag on meeting unemployment claims may rise to the hundreds of billions. But better that money be spent on saving jobs now and getting Americans ready to work than on bailouts and mass unemployment claims for months and months to come.
Congress must choose a comeback. We can adopt a bold program of protection and renewal that will secure our workers and turbocharge our economy for the years to come, if we have the foresight and the courage. It’s time to go all in on the future. It’s time to go all in on America.

Title: Hawley, Blunt, Senators Urge USDA to Allocate Additional Funds to Biofuel Producers Negatively Impacted by COVID-19
Date: Wednesday, April 08, 2020

Content:
Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt joined a bipartisan group of senators in sending a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requesting additional funds be allocated to the biofuel industry through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) during the unprecedented economic circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As the country follows the advice of local and state governments and remain at home, motor fuel use has rapidly decreased… The decrease in fuel consumption has left production facilities little choice but to idle production or close completely,” the senators wrote in a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue.
“Farm income and prices for corn and other crop commodities are directly linked to the health of the renewable fuel industry. Ethanol plants use 40 percent of all corn grown in the United States. Among other feedstocks, biodiesel and renewable diesel producers currently use over 8 billion pounds of soybean oil a year, creating demand that adds 13 percent to the cash price of a bushel of soybeans. We have seen a significant drop in the price of corn and soybeans because of the decline in demand. Keeping plants open is vital for our states and we ask that you use the authority given by Congress to assist the biofuel industry during extremely difficult times. We are supportive of the proposals the biofuel industry has put forward to reimburse feedstocks and also believe that adding additional CCC funds to the Higher-Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program will drive future biofuel demand.”
The historic Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act provided an additional $14 billion to the CCC to help stabilize, support and protect farm income and prices while also maintaining balanced and adequate supplies of agricultural commodities.
In addition to Hawley and Blunt, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Tammy Duckworth (Ill.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Tina Smith (Minn.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jerry Moran (Kan.) and John Thune (S.D).

of the letter bellow:
The Honorable Sonny Perdue
Secretary
1400 Independence Avenue SW
Washington, DC 20250
Dear Secretary Perdue,
We are concerned about our nation’s biofuel sector during the unprecedented economic circumstances brought on by the national pandemic of COVID-19.
As the country follows the advice of local and state governments and remain at home, motor fuel use has rapidly decreased. This dynamic comes on top of EPA’s failure to implement the RFS in accordance with the law, including the issuance of illegal small refinery waivers and the recent failure to enforce ethanol blending requirements. As the consumption of motor fuel continues to decrease in response to COVID-19, it is important to note that most U.S. gasoline contains at least 10 percent ethanol.
We are concerned for the many farmers and producers who will bear the impact of this decrease in consumption, further damaging an already hurting rural economy and resulting in the closing of production facilities that employ many people in rural communities in our home states.
As the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) considers the allocation of additional funds provided to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act we ask that you use the authority provided to assist the biofuel industry.
The decrease in fuel consumption has left production facilities little choice but to idle production or close completely. Since March 1, industry sources show more than four billion gallons of ethanol production has ceased production. The CCC was created to stabilize, support, and protect farm income and prices while also maintaining balanced and adequate supplies of agricultural commodities and aids in their orderly distribution.
Farm income and prices for corn and other crop commodities are directly linked to the health of the renewable fuel industry. Ethanol plants use 40 percent of all corn grown in the United States. Among other feedstocks, biodiesel and renewable diesel producers currently use over 8 billion pounds of soybean oil a year, creating demand that adds 13 percent to the cash price of a bushel of soybeans. We have seen a significant drop in the price of corn and soybeans because of the decline in demand. Keeping plants open is vital for our states and we ask that you use the authority given by Congress to assist the biofuel industry during extremely difficult times. We are supportive of the proposals the biofuel industry has put forward to reimburse feedstocks and also believe that adding additional CCC funds to the Higher-Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program will drive future biofuel demand.
Thank you for considering our request and for your dedication to rural America. We look forward to working with you on deploying the additional resources that Congress gave you in the CARES Act.

Title: Senator Hawley Asks SBA, Treasury to Immediately Issue Follow-Up Guidelines on Religious Organizations in Paycheck Protection Program
Date: Friday, April 03, 2020

Content:
On the first day small businesses can apply for loans under the
Paycheck Protection Program, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza asking they immediately issue follow-up guidelines that make clear that religious organizations can seek relief under the program along with other small businesses and non-profits.
Unlike their earlier guidelines, the law is clear. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act non-profit entities with under 500 employees that are structured as 501(c)(3) organization—including churches and other religious non-profits—are eligible for assistance.
“Religious organizations may continue to suffer economic hardship in this crisis, and it is unacceptable that your agencies’ guidance would leave uncertain their ability to gain the relief to which they are entitled by the law Congress passed. Moreover, the Constitution demands that the government may not discriminate against these religious nonprofits on account of their religious status–whether they engage in sectarian activities or not–in providing this public benefit.”
Senator Hawley
The letter also cites Secretary Mnuchin’s response yesterday when asked if new SBA relief measures include churches and faith groups.
Secretary Mnuchin said, “It does include faith organizations. This is under the PPP, yes, the new SBA program, they are covered.”
Ahead of the application period opening, Senator Hawley
sent a separate letter
to SBA Administrator Carranza yesterday, asking for SBA leadership to correct local and regional offices who were communicating to churches and religious non-profits that they are not eligible to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program.
Full text of the letter is available

April 3, 2020
The Honorable Steven T. Mnuchin
Secretary
Department of Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20220
Jovita Carranza
Administrator
Small Business Administration
409 3rd St., SW
Washington, D.C. 20416
Dear Secretary Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza:
Yesterday, I wrote to you about conflicting or erroneous information regarding the eligibility of churches and religious non-profit organizations to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), despite the fact that Congress left no ambiguity when it authored the CARES Act. The law makes clear that non-profits may participate so long as they meet the minimum requirements explicitly defined by statute: satisfying the employee size standard, having been in operation on February 15, and having paid employees or contractors at that time. The law made no distinction for organizations with a religious or sectarian affiliation or purpose.
Unfortunately, Treasury and Small Business Administration still have not provided definitive guidance to lenders and borrowers about the eligibility of religious non-profits. When asked about the question of religious organization’s eligibility at the President’s daily briefing on April 2, Secretary Mnuchin stated, “It does, although there are some technical issues but yes, it does include faith organizations. This is under the PPP, yes, the new SBA program, they are covered.” Later that evening, the Small Business Administration issued 13 CFR Part 120 Interim Final Rule for the Paycheck Protection Program, which states: “SBA intends to promptly issue additional guidance with regard to religious liberty protections under this program.” Worse, other parts of the Interim Final Rule seem to suggest that a preexisting—and unconstitutional—regulation will apply to forbid religious organizations from applying for the Paycheck Protection Program if their activities are somehow deemed too religious.
Religious organizations may continue to suffer economic hardship in this crisis, and it is unacceptable that your agencies’ guidance would leave uncertain their ability to gain the relief to which they are entitled by the law Congress passed. Moreover, the Constitution demands that the government may not discriminate against these religious nonprofits on account of their religious status—whether they engage in sectarian activities or not—in providing this public benefit. See Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012 (2017).
It is imperative that you immediately issue follow-up guidance, consistent with the Constitution and federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to make clear that these religious organizations can seek immediate relief along with other small businesses and non-profits.
Time is of the essence. The churches and faith-based non-profit organizations that play such a vital role in serving our neighborhoods need these funds—and Congress intends to provide them. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley, Cotton, Curtis, Gallagher Introduce Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act
Date: Friday, April 03, 2020

Content:
Senators Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) and Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), along with Representatives John Curtis (R-Utah), Mike Gallagher (R-Wisconsin), Ted Yoho (R-Florida), Jim Banks (R-IN), and Liz Cheney (R-WY) will introduce the Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act, legislation that would authorize the president to sanction foreign officials who suppress or distort information about international public health crises, including the Wuhan coronavirus. Bill text may be found
here.
“The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for misleading the world about the scope and danger of the coronavirus. Dr. Li Wenliang bravely tried to warn his country and the world about the spread and seriousness of this virus. We should honor his legacy and do our part to hold the CCP accountable for this pandemic.”
Senator Hawley
“Dr. Li tried to warn his country and the world about the Wuhan coronavirus, but he was silenced by the Chinese Communist Party. By hiding the truth about the virus, the CCP turned a regional health problem into a global catastrophe. In honor of Dr. Li, our bill seeks to punish foreign officials responsible for suppressing information about international health crises, including the Wuhan virus,”
said Cotton.
“As Dr. Li Wenliang said, ‘A Healthy Society Shouldn’t Only Have One Voice.’ By suppressing critical public health information, officials in China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and elsewhere have demonstrated they care more about maintaining their grip on power than the health and wellbeing of their people. The Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act—named after the heroic Chinese doctor whistleblower—will ensure that dictators and their cronies think twice before once allowing a local health crisis spiral out of control into a pandemic that endangers the globe,”
said Curtis.
“Had the Chinese Communist Party listened to — rather than suppressed — Dr. Li and his repeated warnings about the coronavirus, we could have prevented this global pandemic and saved lives. Instead, Chinese officials deliberately lied and misled the world about the severity of this virus in an effort to protect their reckless regime. It’s time we hold these apparatchiks accountable for the damage they’ve done to the world,”
said Gallagher.
Background
The Li Wenliang Global Public Health Accountability Act is sanctions legislation modeled after the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.
It would authorize the president to sanction foreign officials who suppress or distort information about international public health crises, including the Wuhan coronavirus.
These sanctions include inadmissibility to the United States, revocation of existing U.S. visas, and the blocking of all property within the United States.
This legislation would provide Congress with the authority to request that the president review specific foreign officials for sanctions eligibility. Within 120 days of receiving such a request, the president must report to Congress on whether he/she intends to impose sanctions.

Title: Sen. Hawley Outlines Phase 4 Relief Plan: Rehire Workers & Bring Supply Chains Back
Date: Friday, April 03, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced
a new proposal
for Phase 4 Coronavirus relief legislation to help get Americans back to work and to position the U.S. economy for a comeback. The proposal includes a major initiative to rehire workers now and keep them on payroll throughout this crisis, new measures to bring critical supply chains back to the United States from overseas and encourage domestic production, and reforms to prevent Wall Street crisis profiteering.
In the proposal, Senator Hawley writes:
“As layoffs mount, the time has come for bold action by the federal government to halt the damage to American workers and position the American economy for a comeback once the nation has defeated COVID19. This effort should include a major initiative to rehire workers now—and to keep them on payroll for the duration of this crisis. And it should include new measures to bring critical supply chains back to this country from China and elsewhere and to encourage domestic production.
“The rationale is simple. Workers should not be forced into unemployment because of the government’s health measures prompted by this crisis. Workers should be able to keep their jobs, and be ready to get back to work as soon as practicable.
“This pandemic also exposed a Grand Canyon size fault in our supply chain. We don’t make critical products in America anymore. It’s a threat to our health, our national security and our economy. Americans have long known about this problem. Washington is just waking up to it, and Wall Street was hoping it wouldn’t get caught. It’s time to fix it. We need to invest in America again and protect our people. The goal is simple – If we need it, we should make it.
“If we pursue policies for continuous employment combined with bringing our supply chains back, it will super charge a recovery. Policymakers must act now to ensure that the present crisis is the gateway to a stronger American economy. It’s time to get America ready for a comeback.”
Full text of the proposal is available here
and highlights of the proposal are below.
Getting America Back to Work
Rehire America:
Senator Hawley’s proposal offers immediate payroll support for the duration of this emergency with no strings attached. No loans, no bank intermediaries, no repayment:
A refundable payroll tax rebate covering eighty percent of employer payroll costs applicable up to median wages, including support for rehired workers, with a rehiring bonus.
A real-time advance system for providing payroll support immediately to firms.
A back to work reinvestment credit for firms to cover costs of any investment necessary to get back off the ground even stronger once this crisis subsides.
These protections should be coupled with additional reforms to promote long-term recovery by bringing back critical supply chains, encouraging domestic production, and preventing crisis profiteering by Wall Street:
Securing Medical Supply Chains:
New local content requirements for essential industries like medical supplies and crisis export controls for necessary medical equipment, coupled with liability protections for firms enlisted by the government into emergency production.
Promoting Onshoring:
Federally backed, low-interest financing for capital expenditures by firms that onshore production this year in response to global supply chain disruptions.
Preventing Crisis Profiteering by Wall Street:
Measures to prevent a feeding frenzy by Wall Street on the wounded firms of Main Street including:
Reforms to securities law to require immediate disclosure of the accumulation of large stakes of public companies by activist investors before they force layoffs, liquidations, and the raiding of companies’ productive capacities.
Increased antitrust enforcement during the crisis period to prevent anticompetitive behavior from sliding under the radar.
New corporate rainy-day savings requirements to ensure companies have a liquidity cushion during future crises and give managers leverage to resist Wall Street demands to take on excess debt to finance shareholder distributions.

Jovita Carranza
Administrator
U.S. Small Business Administration 409 3rd St., SW
Washington, D.C. 20416
Dear Administrator Carranza:
Today, it has come to my attention that some local and regional Small Business Administration (SBA) offices are providing conflicting or erroneous information regarding the eligibility of churches and religious non-profit organizations to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program. SBA offices are communicating to churches that they are not eligible for the program before the application process. I am alarmed by these reports and I demand that this be rectified immediately.
Section 1102 of the CARES Act is unambiguous on this matter. Unaffiliated non-profit entities with under 500 employees that are structured as 501(c)(3) organizations are eligible for assistance. This includes churches and other religious non-profits. As I noted in my previous letter dated April 1, 2020, organizations with a principal religious purpose are not excluded from assistance under the Paycheck Protection Program.
I urge that you move to immediately correct this misinformation and clarify to your local and regional offices that they must not arbitrarily disqualify churches and other religious non-profits from eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program. These reports further underscore the importance of swiftly implementing official guidance and program rules for this program as to avoid any further confusion.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Hawley, Blunt Join Colleagues in Urging USDA to Provide Immediate Assistance to Cattle Producers
Date: Thursday, April 02, 2020

Content:
This week, Missouri Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers in sending a letter urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to provide immediate assistance to cattle producers by using the resources provided in the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act, including the replenishment of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and additional emergency funding. The resources would facilitate the stabilization of farm and ranch income for producers who are facing market volatility in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout.
“The COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the need for domestic food security,”
the lawmakers wrote.
“All farmers and ranchers are vital to our country’s ability to keep food on the table in a future pandemic or related crisis, and many producers, including young producers, are often highly leveraged and cannot fall back on years of equity in a time of crisis. As such, we urge you to quickly deliver relief to producers as we work to lessen the economic impact of this pandemic.”
Hawley, Blunt, and others worked hard to ensure the CARES Act replenished the CCC and appropriated an additional $9.5 billion for USDA to assist producers, including livestock producers, throughout this crisis.
In addition to Hawley and Blunt and, the letter was signed by more than 140 Members of Congress.

The Honorable Sonny Perdue
Secretary
U.S. Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20250
Dear Secretary Perdue,
We write to request swift assistance for cattle producers with the resources provided in the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act to facilitate the stabilization of farm and ranch income to producers who are facing market volatility in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout.
Recognizing the market volatility and financial hardships producers are facing because of COVID-19, the CARES Act provides $14 billion toward replenishment of the Commodity Credit Corporation and an additional $9.5 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to assist farmers and ranchers in response to COVID-19. While we do not know what the full market impact will be for the various commodities produced in our states, we recognize that there is an immediate need for assistance for our cattle producers.
We request that USDA consider data and estimates available from the Office of the Chief Economist and implement a program that would directly respond to the negative effect on producers caused by COVID-19. This program should deliver targeted, temporary, equitable relief to cattle producers in a manner that limits market distortions and negative effects on price discovery.
The COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the need for domestic food security. All farmers and ranchers are vital to our country’s ability to keep food on the table in a future pandemic or related crisis, and many producers, including young producers, are often highly leveraged and cannot fall back on years of equity in a time of crisis. As such, we urge you to quickly deliver relief to producers as we work to lessen the economic impact of this pandemic.

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Bipartisan Letter Urging Immediate HHS Support to Rural Hospitals
Date: Tuesday, March 31, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers in calling on Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to provide immediate support to rural hospitals and healthcare providers as they take on the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. The letter, signed by 41 senators and 81 representatives, warned that responding to the pandemic could force rural hospitals to close and requested that Secretary Azar provide members of Congress with a teleconference briefing on his efforts by April 3, 2020.
“Small and rural hospitals across the nation are facing an acute financial crisis. Even before this crisis, nearly one-half of rural hospitals were operating at a financial loss, and hundreds were on the brink of closure. Now, they are confronting impossible choices during this public health emergency. The administration must focus on ensuring financial viability of these providers. Failure to take fast and aggressive action will put the health of our communities at further risk.”
Excerpt from the letter to HHS
Senator Hawley
recently warned
Secretary Azar and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Peter Gaynor of potential staffing shortages and other increased stresses on Missouri’s healthcare and hospital systems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for International Investigation into China’s Coronavirus Cover-Up
Date: Tuesday, March 24, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a
resolution
calling for an international investigation into the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) cover-up of the early spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Senator Hawley’s resolution calls on China to pay back all nations impacted because China lied about the spread of the virus.
U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) is introducing companion legislation in the House.
“Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic. The CCP was aware of the reality of the virus as early as December but ordered laboratories to destroy samples and forced doctors to keep silent. It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.”
Senator Josh Hawley
“The Communist government of China knowingly withheld critical information needed to combat the spread of the Chinese-born COVID-19 and to this day continues to spread lies and disinformation on the origin of the deadly virus,”
said Congresswoman Stefanik. “There is no doubt that China’s unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing. This Resolution calls for China to provide compensation for the harm, loss, and destruction their arrogance brought upon the rest of the world. Simply put – China must, and will, be held accountable.”
The resolution condemns the CCP’s decision to hide the details of the outbreak during its initial weeks and calls for an investigation into how the CPP’s handling of the coronavirus before March 11, 2020 contributed to the emergence of a global pandemic.

Washington, D.C. 20472
Dear Secretary Azar and Administrator Gaynor,
As Missouri reports its first death due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) and the state begins implementing state-wide precautionary measures, I write to you both concerning preparations for staffing shortages and disruptions in the state’s healthcare and hospital systems.
The Golden Valley Memorial Hospital in Clinton, Missouri, is
no longer accepting new patients
after treating one with coronavirus. Springfield, Missouri, has a limited number of hospital beds and draws patients from a broad geographic area, raising concerns that space and care might be further restricted amid responses to coronavirus.
These circumstances must be seen in light of the already troubling trends for the state’s healthcare system. A
report
published by the Missouri Hospital Association noted that 32 rural counties in the state do not have licensed hospitals, requiring their residents to travel large distances. In 2014, 9% of the state’s licensed physicians practiced in rural areas, reflecting a 15% drop since 2011, and six rural hospitals have closed
over the last five years
(with three of those between 2018 and 2019).
[3]
In light of these difficult circumstances, I would like to know what kinds of options HHS and FEMA are considering to address potential workforce shortages and stresses on Missouri’s healthcare system. In particular, please let me know of any plans HHS and FEMA might have to deploy medical response teams, such as Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) and/or the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, or other contingency measures to help augment the healthcare needs of Missouri’s communities.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Sen. Hawley Announces Amendment Fix for Phase 3 Legislation To Provide Direct Relief to All Individuals & Families From Middle Class Down
Date: Friday, March 20, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced an amendment to the Senate’s phase three coronavirus economic package to ensure that low-income families, including those without federal tax liabilities, are not excluded from receiving the direct relief they need during the coronavirus pandemic.
Senator Hawley’s amendment
would guarantee that low-income individuals and families get the full benefit. In the current draft of the legislation, the direct cash assistance for families penalizes lower income families. The bill “phases in” benefits only after recipients reach a minimum income threshold. Low-income Americans should not receive less relief than middle-income Americans.
Senator Hawley introduced a
proposal earlier this week
to deliver direct relief to working families on a need-basis, and has since expressed
his concern
that the proposed payments to working Americans in bill three do not go far enough.
Official text of his amendment as filed today can be found here:
Strike subsection (a) of Section 2101 and replace with
(a) In General.—Subchapter B of chapter 65 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after section 6427 the following new section:
“SEC. 6428. 2020 RECOVERY REBATES FOR INDIVIDUALS.
“(a) In General.—In the case of an eligible individual, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the first taxable year beginning in 2020 an amount equal to $1,200 ($2,400 in the case of a joint return).
“(b) Special Rules.—
“(1) Child benefit.—In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (2), the amount determined under subsection (a) shall be increased by the product of $500 multiplied by the number of qualifying children (within the meaning of section 24(c)) of the taxpayer.
“(2) Taxpayer described.—A taxpayer is described in this paragraph if the taxpayer—
“(A) is a resident of the United States of America, and
“(B) has a valid Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.
“(c) Treatment of Credit.—The credit allowed by subsection (a) shall be treated as allowed by subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1.
“(d) Limitation Based on Adjusted Gross Income.—The amount of the credit allowed by subsection (a) (determined without regard to this subsection and subsection (f)) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 5 percent of so much of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income as exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 in the case of a joint return).
“(e) Eligible Individual.—The term ‘eligible individual’ means any individual other than—
“(1) any nonresident alien individual,
“(2) any individual with respect to whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual’s taxable year begins, and
“(3) an estate or trust.
“(f) Coordination With Advance Refunds of Credit.—
“(1) In general.—The amount of credit which would (but for this paragraph) be allowable under this section shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate refunds and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer under subsection (g). Any failure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as arising out of a mathematical or clerical error and assessed according to section 6213(b)(1).
“(2) Joint returns.—In the case of a refund or credit made or allowed under subsection (g) with respect to a joint return, half of such refund or credit shall be treated as having been made or allowed to each individual filing such return.
“(g) Advance Refunds and Credits.—
“(1) In general.—Subject to paragraph (5), each individual who was an eligible individual for such individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2018 shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such first taxable year in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for such taxable year.
“(2) Advance refund amount.—For purposes of paragraph (1), the advance refund amount is the amount that would have been allowed as a credit under this section for such first taxable year if this section (other than subsection (f) and this subsection) had applied to such taxable year.
“(3) Timing of payments.—The Secretary shall, subject to the provisions of this title, refund or credit any overpayment attributable to this section as rapidly as possible. No refund or credit shall be made or allowed under this subsection after December 31, 2020.
“(4) No interest.—No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment attributable to this section.
“(5) Alternate taxable year.—In the case of an individual who, at the time of any determination made pursuant to paragraph (3), has not filed a tax return for the year described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may apply such paragraph by substituting ‘2019’ for ‘2018’.
“(h) Identification Number Requirement.—
“(1) In general.—No credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) to an eligible individual who does not include on the return of tax for the taxable year—
“(A) such individual’s valid identification number,

Yesterday, Senator Hawley announced he would introduce the
Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020
to provide families facing uncertainty during the coronavirus outbreak a guarantee of financial relief from looming economic hardship. The legislation sends relief to families based on the number of children that they have and their income.
Direct assistance to working people is a good start, but FAMILIES with kids need more relief. A working single mom with three kids needs more support than an unmarried computer programmer living in his parents’ basement. Help families

Title: Senator Hawley Sends Letter to FCC Chairman Pai Urging Immediate Action to Ensure Broadband Internet Access During Coronavirus Pandemic
Date: Wednesday, March 18, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai urging him to take immediate action to strengthen broadband internet access for the millions of Americans currently self-isolating. Senator Hawley requested information on what the FCC is doing to ensure Americans have affordable and uninterrupted internet access during the coronavirus pandemic, how the agency plans to deal with increased web traffic, and what steps the agency is taking to provide new options for Americans without internet access.
“As schools close and businesses shift employees to telework, more Americans than ever will find themselves dependent on their home internet connection,” wrote Senator Hawley. “This is a daunting reality for those who lack sufficient, reliable, affordable broadband. Your pledge to Keep Americans Connected is a good start, but more is needed.”

March 16, 2020
The Honorable Ajit Pai
Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street SW
Washington, DC 20554
Dear Chairman Pai:
I write today to urge strong and immediate action to strengthen broadband internet access at affordable rates to the millions of Americans now self-isolating in an effort to protect themselves and limit the spread of the coronavirus.
As schools close and businesses shift employees to telework more Americans than ever will find themselves dependent on their home internet connection. This is a daunting reality for those who lack sufficient, reliable, affordable broadband. Your pledge to Keep Americans Connected is a good start, but more is needed.
The FCC has been central to expanding broadband internet access to millions of Americans. As such, I request your response to the following questions:
How are you and the FCC urgently working too ensure Americans’ connection to each other and to the web remains affordable and uninterrupted for the duration of this pandemic?
What actions has the agency taken to prepare a regulatory framework to prevent predatory practices and protect millions of Americans from surprise billing as they work and learn from home?
As this pandemic progresses and abates, how are you working to spare citizens from a billing nightmare due to exceeding data caps?
As networks fill with traffic, how will you make sure those who need to work will not be throttled or students will be able to continue their education?
For those families, businesses, and students without a connection to the internet who are now staying home and practicing social distancing, what is the FCC doing to provide new options for them to access the internet at affordable rates?
What additional resources or statutory authority, if any, does the FCC need to act quickly during a pandemic to ensure internet service to Americans remains affordable and uninterrupted?
Your leadership on the Keeping Americans Connected pledge is appreciated. I, along with all Missourians, look forward to seeing strong action to enforce that pledge and to your answers to my questions. Please respond no later than Monday, March 23, 2020.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Announces Emergency Family Relief Plan
Date: Tuesday, March 17, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
unveiled
the
Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020
to provide families facing uncertainty during the coronavirus outbreak a guarantee of financial relief from looming economic hardship. The bill’s introduction comes in advance of Senate consideration of the House-passed Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a proposal requiring employers with fewer than 500 employees to guarantee workers paid sick and family leave.
“Struggling families need help, and they don’t have time to sort through confusing rules and mandates about who’s paying for what and how. They’re not sure what’s going to happen to mom’s or dad’s workplace during this crisis, or if their work can afford to keep everyone on payroll. Let’s not overthink this. These families need relief — now — to pay bills that are coming due, make those emergency grocery runs, and get ready for potential medical bills. Let’s get it to them.”
Senator Hawley
Yesterday evening, Senator Hawley
argued
that, “With 30 million children out of school as of today & parents straining to cover work & childcare, Congress needs to provide additional, targeted relief to parents — and soon.” The Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020 achieves just that.
As Senator Hawley noted this morning on Fox and Friends, “This would send relief to families based on the number of children that they have and the size of their income, based on need, to help parents who are having to stay home and care for a child, who are having to maybe care for a loved one, and who are having to try and find some sort of childcare so that they can go on working. I think we need to get relief into the hands of working families right now.”
The Emergency Family Relief Act of 2020
Provide families experiencing school closures or financial hardship a fully refundable monthly benefit lasting through the coronavirus emergency to make it through this crisis unscathed. The benefit matches the IRS’s monthly standards for household expenses:
$1,446 for a family of three
$1,786 for a family of four
$2,206 for a family of five
Guarantee timely benefit delivery every month during this emergency by building on existing federal payment and verification infrastructure run by the Treasury Department and expedited applications utilizing past tax return data for prior filers
Target those most in need – providing its full benefit to all single parents making less than $50,000 and to all married parents making less than $100,000 before phasing down the credit value – with a benefit generous enough to cover real costs
Who qualifies?
All married parents of underage children making below $100,000 receive the full benefit for periods of economic distress or school closure due to coronavirus. Single parents receive the full benefit up to $50,000 in income. It reduces by $50 per $1000 in income above these thresholds.
Do I also get paid leave?
The House-passed coronavirus response legislation offers a federally financed paid leave benefit for workers. If both policies were implemented, families who receive one benefit would remain eligible for the other.
How will I apply and receive the benefit?
Through the tax collection infrastructure, the Treasury Department has data ready on all tax filers and systems in place to provide rapid delivery of benefits like this one. Applicants will be able to use their 2018 tax data to apply seamlessly. Treasury will also provide a process to allow new filers an opportunity to demonstrate eligibility.

Title: Senators Hawley, Scott Introduce Legislation to Ban TikTok from Government Devices
Date: Thursday, March 12, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced
legislation
to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. The State Department, the
Department of Homeland Security, the
Department of Defense, and
TSA
have already banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.
“TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members on its board, and it is required by law to share user data with Beijing. The company even admitted it collects user data while their app is running in the background – including the messages people send, pictures they share, their keystrokes and location data, you name it. As many of our federal agencies have already recognized, TikTok is a major security risk to the United States, and it has no place on government devices.”
Senator Hawley
Senator Scott said, “The use of apps like TikTok by federal employees on government devices is a risk to our network and a threat to our national security, and I’m proud to join Senator Hawley to put an end to it. We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China, and I hope my colleagues will join me to implement this ban immediately and protect our national security.”
Senator Hawley
announced
he would be introducing the bill in last week’s Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee entitled, “Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing.” TikTok
declined
his invitation to testify in the hearing – just as they did for the Subcommittee’s hearing in
November. After the November hearing, Senator Hawley introduced the
National Security and Personal Data Protection Act
to combat the flow of Americans’ sensitive personal data to China and countries that similarly threaten national security.

Title: Senator Hawley Questions U.S. Medical Supply Chain Dependence on China in Committee Hearing
Date: Thursday, March 12, 2020

Content:
Today in the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing entitled “
The Coronavirus and America’s Small Business Supply Chain,” U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned panelists on the United States medical supply chain’s dependence on China.
Senator Hawley questioned Hastings Center Senior Adviser
Rosemary Gibson
on how many American drugs involve Chinese production.
“Thousands. Thousands of our generic drugs and even some of the brand name products and perhaps even new therapies for coronavirus may depend on the chemicals that are sourced primarily in China. . . I was sitting in a room with the people that actually make medicines. These are the men and women in pharmaceutical engineering and pharmaceutical chemistry. I said, ‘So tell me, if you have to make these tomorrow, where do the core chemicals come from to make it? How much are we dependent on China?’ They said 90 percent of the chemicals to make those basic generic drugs depend on China.”
Rosemary Gibson
Senator Hawley asked Johns Hopkins University Professor
Dr. Gerard Anderson
how the federal government can support small biotech companies and if their being bought up by large pharma companies accelerates the offshoring of the US capacity to China.
“Essentially that they have a guaranteed place to sell their products. Right now, they are coming up with these great new ideas, but they don’t always have a place to see their products… The big companies are looking where they can produce least expensively and then going there, especially the generic because it’s all price driven.”
Dr. Gerard Anderson
Senator Hawley also questioned
Mr. Tim Morrison, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, on the motive of the U.S. ending the domestic production of penicillin in 2004, despite 62 million penicillin prescriptions being filled in the U.S. in 2015.
“I think the point of Made in China 2025 is essentially to destroy the free market and create incentives to offshore production in China. And originally this seemed like a good thing. We’ll save prices. We’ll move value, or value you can move, we’ll continue to do the innovation, but China is scooping that up as well. And so, without any decision by any government authority this happened and now we are going to deal with the consequences. And of course, an antibiotic isn’t instrumental to treat a virus, but the respiratory infection, it is.”
Tim Morrison
Senator Hawley
introduced
the Medical Supply Chain Security Act to help secure the U.S. medical product supply chain, in light of
reports
of potential American drug shortages due the coronavirus outbreak. Companion legislation was
introduced
in the House last week. He has also
questioned
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanding answers for what is being done to mitigate potential drug and medical device shortages here in the United States.

Title: Sens. Hawley, Blumenthal Write to DOJ: If Investigating Google, It Must Include Search
Date: Tuesday, March 10, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a
letter
to Attorney General William Barr asking the Department of Justice (DOJ) to ensure that its antitrust investigation into Google includes the company’s search operations. In the letter, the Senators point to the European Union
fining
Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finding evidence that Google engaged in similar search manipulation as early as 2012.
In the letter the Senators explain, “Google enjoys market dominance in online advertising, but it has that dominance in substantial part because of its enormous search engine market share. Google’s online advertising conduct is inextricably linked to Google’s search activities. It is critical to remember that the company’s primary function is supplying a search engine to users, producing billions of search results for Americans every week. Narrowing the investigation’s focus such that Google’s anticompetitive practices to dominate the online search market is not captured does a grave disservice to consumers.”
Senator Hawley has been vocal about antitrust concerns surrounding the tech giant. As Attorney General of Missouri in 2017, Senator Hawley was the first AG in the country to launch an antitrust investigation into
Google. He has continued to take action in the Senate, calling for the FTC to
release its full 2012 report
on Google’s anticompetitive business practices. He has also called for an
overhaul
of the FTC which would relocate the FTC to the DOJ, making it directly accountable, while strengthening its market analysis and enforcement powers.
Full text of the letter can be found
here
and below.
March 10, 2020
The Honorable William P. Barr
Attorney General
Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Ave. NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
We write to urge the Justice Department to ensure that its investigation into Google’s anticompetitive practices includes online search and is not limited to Google’s behavior in the online advertising market. While public reporting has for months indicated that the Department’s Antitrust Division is undertaking a comprehensive investigation into Google’s practices, recent reporting suggests that the probe has focused narrowly on the company’s online advertising business.[1] Google enjoys market dominance in online advertising, but it has that dominance in substantial part because of its enormous search engine market share. Google’s online advertising conduct is inextricably linked to Google’s search activities. It is critical to remember that the company’s primary function is supplying a search engine to users, producing billions of search results for Americans every week. Narrowing the investigation’s focus such that Google’s anticompetitive practices to dominate the online search market is not captured does a grave disservice to consumers.
How Google operates its search engine warrants close scrutiny. At more than 90 percent of the global market share for search, the opportunities for anticompetitive conduct are substantial. While there is nothing illegal about obtaining market share through innovation or efficiency, evidence suggests that Google obtained its market share through illicit means. For example, Google has long publicly professed that its search engine simply returns the most relevant, organic result. But three years ago, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results to disfavor its competitors. And as early as 2012, the FTC discovered evidence that Google engaged in a pattern of similar search manipulation in the United States. In short, there is ample evidence that Google has a history of producing biased search results that discriminate against its competitors to favor its own properties, a practice which is anticompetitive and warrants scrutiny.
Anticompetitive conduct in search engines is especially pernicious because it can ensure permanent, illicit dominance. Because of Google’s market share, it receives far more data than other search engines—data that it can use to improve its algorithm. Once a search engine obtains dominance through anticompetitive means, it may never be possible for other companies to build a truly competitive product absent antitrust enforcement.
We have long thought that an antitrust investigation of dominant tech companies was overdue, and we were pleased to find out last year that the Department has launched an investigation. However, because Google’s advertising operations are in many ways downstream of its search operations, an investigation that focuses only on online advertisements risks failing to address the primary source of anticompetitive conduct. We urge the Department, in its antitrust investigation into Google, to consider comprehensively Google’s practices in the search market.
We look forward to a response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley & 14 Senators Sponsor Resolution to Censure Senator Schumer for Threatening Supreme Court Justices
Date: Thursday, March 05, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley introduced a
resolution
to censure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for threatening two U.S. Supreme Court Justices. The resolution, cosponsored by 14 Senators upon introduction, condemns the Senate Minority Leader’s remarks at a pro-abortion rally in front of the Supreme Court yesterday, noting that political violence has increased in the United States over the last decade, including the targeting and murder of federal judges and their family members.
They resolution comes after Senator Schumer threatened Justices by name yesterday,
saying, “I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.”
The resolution reads,
“Senator Schumer has acknowledged that threatening statements can increase the dangers of violence against government officials when he stated on June 15, 2017, following the attempted murder of several elected Members of Congress, ‘We would all be wise to reflect on the importance of civility in our [N]ation’s politics’ and that ‘the level of nastiness, vitriol, and hate that has seeped into our politics must be excised.’”
U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) are all original cosponsors of Senator Hawley’s resolution.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Send Letter to Parliament Citing Concerns with UK’s Huawei Partnership
Date: Wednesday, March 04, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and a bipartisan group of Senators have sent a letter to Members of the House of Commons expressing significant concerns with the United Kingdom’s decision to allow Huawei Technologies to take part in its 5G network infrastructure. The letter highlights Huawei’s close relationship with the Chinese Communist Party’s intelligence-gathering authorities and steps the United States has taken to ban Huawei from its own network infrastructure.
“Given the significant security, privacy, and economic threats posed by Huawei, we strongly urge the United Kingdom to revisit its recent decision, take steps to mitigate the risks of Huawei, and work in close partnership with the U.S. on such efforts going forward.”
They continued, “We understand the challenges the U.K. faces regarding a lack of diverse, secure, and affordable suppliers. These are challenges we also face here in the United States. However, the security and integrity of our telecommunications infrastructure cannot be compromised for convenience. We therefore ask for commitments from our respective governments – along with trusted partners such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and European allies – to work together to advance a comprehensive strategy to secure our 5G systems.”
Senator Hawley has taken additional steps to address Huawei’s threats to American security, introducing
a bill
to prevent sensitive academic research projects from using Huawei technologies,
demanding answers
from Google on their relationship with the company, and joining
a bipartisan letter
to President Trump requesting he suspend approval of licenses allowing some U.S. companies to do business with Huawei.
Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.) also signed onto the letter.

Title: TikTok, National Security Threats the Focus of Hawley’s ‘Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing’ Hearing
Date: Wednesday, March 04, 2020

Content:
In today’s “
Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing
” hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, announced he would
introduce legislation
to ban all federal employees from the use of TikTok on government devices.
“TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership, and it is requires by Chinese law to share user data with Beijing. TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risk for the American people. . . This legislation is a necessary step to protect the security of the United States and the data security of every American.”
Senator Hawley
In the hearing, law enforcement and policy experts shed light onto the national security threats that companies like TikTok and Apple pose through their ties to Beijing. Both companies
declined
his invitation – just as they did for the Subcommittee’s hearing in
November.
In the hearing today, Mr. Derek Scissors Resident Scholar at American Enterprise Institute, said, “We have [American companies saying] ‘we can’t innovate nearly as well without China,’ a Chinese government that really wants to acquire any innovation it can, and that’s—to me—why you don’t have companies that want to come testify. Because they’re telling you, ‘we are transferring technology to China because we need China to innovate and they want the tech.'”
Since the his first committee hearing as chair last year,
the State Department, the Departments of Homeland Security
and
Defense, and
TSA
have banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.
Mr. Adam Hickey Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ National Security Division said, “In terms of leverage, I’m concerned about a company that does business here, but is ultimately accountable to a parent company in China and susceptible to leverage by the Chinese government. And so I think those who do business with those who do business with those companies may be exposing themselves to an actor who may be co-opted.”
At the end of year, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Senator Hawley that the FBI is
“concerned
” with companies like Apple who store their data in China because “Chinese law essentially compels Chinese companies and typically compels U.S. companies that are operating in China to have relationships with different kinds of Chinese companies to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants.”

Title: House Introduces Companion Bill to Senator Hawley’s “Medical Supply Chain Security Act”
Date: Tuesday, March 03, 2020

Content:
As the Coronavirus outbreak raises concerns of medical supply shortages, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have introduced
companion legislation
to U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
Medical Supply Chain Security Act. The bill would strengthen medical supply chains by giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to analyze sourcing locations of medical products and help more quickly bring products to market should shortages exist.
“The coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it’s a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical device.”
Senator Hawley
Rep. Gallagher said, “Our overreliance on products made in China doesn’t just threaten our medical supply chains. It threatens public health. As the coronavirus outbreak highlights how vulnerable access to critical medicines and medical products can be, it’s clear we need to find better ways to assess vulnerabilities within our medical supply chain. By allowing the FDA to identify our overreliance and swiftly take the necessary corrective actions, this bill would allow us to get upstream of potential shortages and better protect Americans access to critical medicines and lifesaving supplies.”
Rep. Pocan said, “With the continued spread of the coronavirus resulting in numerous deaths in the United States, it is imperative that we provide the FDA with tools they need to better prepare for responses and shortages in medical supplies. We need this legislation because currently no law exists requiring medical device manufacturers to notify the FDA when they become aware of a potential shortages or even requiring them to respond to the FDA’s requests for information about the medical device supply chain. Due to our dependence on foreign manufacturing, we need to better understand the threat that supply chain shortages for life-saving medical devices have on patients in America, and we must ensure our government is able to prepare accordingly.”
Senator Hawley
introduced
his bill (
S.3343
) in the U.S. Senate on February 27, after
reports
of potential drug shortages due to the Coronavirus outbreak in China.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Crack Down on Bad Landlords
Date: Monday, March 02, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced legislation
to coordinate actions of federal and local housing authorities to crack down on landlords who fail to uphold basic living standards for their tenants.
The Bad Landlord Database Act
requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to create a comprehensive database of terminations of contracts with landlords due to violations of Housing Assistance Payments contracts. The legislation also requires local public housing authorities (PHAs) to report bad landlords to HUD.
“Bad landlords have abused our housing system for too long and it’s happening right here in Missouri. They have taken advantage of tenants, failed to provide them the most basic living standards, forced them to live in squalor – all while demanding rent and bills continue to be paid. And because their properties span jurisdictions, they have gotten away with it. It’s time we hold these scumbag landlords accountable. This legislation will be a major step forward in getting tenants and local communities the transparency and relief they deserve.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Mayor Lucas said, “This bill is a welcome step to improve federal oversight of bad actor landlords and to reinforce protections I have already enacted in Kansas City with the recent passage of a Tenants’ Rights package. Just as that package was crafted through close collaboration with City Council and local advocates, I appreciate the effort Sen. Hawley has made to solicit feedback from local jurisdictions in crafting his legislation. We need more of this type of collaborative policymaking — especially on critical issues such as housing that impact every family — and I remain committed to strengthening our partnership to prioritize the 49 percent of Kansas Citians who are renters.”
Executive Director of the Legal Aid of Western Missouri Joe Dandurand said, “Our Housing Team at Legal Aid of Western Missouri is very appreciative of Senator Hawley’s efforts to legislatively improve the plight of our low-income clients with extremely difficult housing issues. We believe this proposed bill is a very good step in the right direction and we applaud the Senator’s recognition of the need to address this chronic issue in Missouri, not just in the major urban areas, but throughout rural Missouri as well.”
Executive Director Legal Services of Eastern Missouri Dan Glazier said, “The problem of substandard, low-income housing is a very significant issue facing the clients we serve throughout eastern Missouri. The lack of decent, affordable housing is a crisis for those in need. We appreciate Senator Hawley’s recognition of this challenge our low-income clients face and his efforts to address this problem.”
After touring one of TEH Realty’s most
dangerous
and unlivable properties, Bridgeport Crossing, Senator Hawley called for federal investigations into TEH Realty properties in both
St. Louis
and
Kansas City
that have received federal funds in the past. HUD has
opened an investigation
into the properties, and Secretary Carson
has since said
there will be “consequences” for TEH Realty. The St. Louis, St. Louis County, and Kansas City PHAs have determined that they will no longer contract with the landlord.
Background
When landlords participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program threaten the wellbeing of tenants by neglecting proper maintenance of their properties, tenants and taxpayers deserve preventative action by housing officials. Unfortunately, our current system leaves local public housing authorities (PHAs) blind to offenses committed outside their own jurisdiction, depriving them of the information they need to protect tenants from landlords who have proven themselves unworthy of federal housing dollars.
PHAs can suspend business with offending properties within their jurisdiction, as in the case of TEH Realty in Missouri, where the St. Louis St. Louis, St. Louis County, and Kansas City PHAs have cut ties with the landlord for repeated violations of housing quality standards. But this remedy does little to inform other jurisdictions contracting with TEH Realty that such offenses and enforcement actions have occurred.
Surprisingly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lacks both a nationwide list of offending landlords and a data-sharing tool to inform PHAs when such offenses take place. HUD and PHAs need more tools to ensure compliance with housing quality standards. In the interest of remedying this glaring oversight gap, Senator Josh Hawley will introduce legislation to create a national bad landlords’ database to give local housing officials the information they need to ensure that bad landlords victimizing tenants across the country are not also victimizing tenants within their own jurisdiction.
The Bad Landlord Database Act
will:
Require HUD to create a comprehensive database of properties and property owners participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
Require PHAs to report to HUD any actions it takes against properties and property owners for violating the terms of their Housing Assistant Payments contracts related to housing quality standards.
Require HUD to create a comprehensive list of all such violations and any actions PHAs take against the offending properties and property owners.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Secure U.S. Medical Product Supply Chain in Light of Coronavirus Outbreak
Date: Thursday, February 27, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is introducing
legislation
to help secure the United States medical product supply chain.
The Medical Supply Chain Security Act
comes after
reports
of potential American drug shortages due to the Coronavirus outbreak in China.
“The coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it’s a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices.”
Senator Hawley
Earlier this week, Senator Hawley
sent a letter
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanding answers for what is being done to mitigate potential drug and medical device shortages here in the United States. Since the outbreak began, he has also
called
for the United States to consider restricting all commercial travel to and from China and
requested
federal agencies outline their plans on when and how to implement travel restrictions.
More information on the bill is available
here
or below.
Background
The spread of the novel coronavirus in China has highlighted severe, longstanding, and unresolved vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical product supply chain. Slowing production at Chinese factories is impacting the supply of key components for pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices produced in the United States, threatening shortages of essential medical products. On February 23rd, Axios reported that the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus has threatened the domestic supply of some 150 pharmaceutical drugs, including antibiotics, generics, and branded drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives in the market. This follows reports of widespread shortages of surgical masks and other personal protective equipment.
Currently, the ability of our public health officials to accurately measure and assess the vulnerability of our medical supply chain is limited. In its Congressional Budget Justification for fiscal year 2021, the FDA asked Congress for more statutory authority to require that manufacturers of medical devices notify the FDA when they become aware of circumstances that may lead to the shortage of an essential medical device. Such information would allow the FDA to ensure that they can take appropriate steps to mitigate potential shortages of life-saving and life-sustaining medical products.
This bill will give the FDA this authority and more. Our public health officials must be privy to the details of the manufacturing capacity of producers of essential drugs and medical devices so that they and Congress can take the necessary action to protect access to vital medical products in the United States. Stronger reporting requirements will help reveal the degree to which our medical product industry is reliant on Chinese production and uncover exactly how vulnerable our medical supply chain really is.
The Medical Supply Chain Security Act
will:
Require that manufacturers report imminent or forecasted shortages of life-saving or life-sustaining medical devices to the FDA just as they currently do for pharmaceutical drugs. This new information on devices would be added to the FDA’s annual report to Congress on drug shortages.
Allow the FDA to expedite the review of essential medical devices that require pre-market approval in the event of an expected shortage reported by a manufacturer.
Give new authority to the FDA to request information from manufacturers of essential drugs or devices regarding all aspects of their manufacturing capacity, including sourcing of component parts, sourcing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, use of any scarce raw materials, and any other details the FDA deems relevant to assess the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain.

Title: Senators Hawley, Hassan Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Help Startups Thrive
Date: Tuesday, February 25, 2020

Content:
Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced a bipartisan bill to support innovative startups across the country by establishing a competitive grant program for incubator networks. Incubators help startups by providing resources such as low-cost space, access to capital, business counseling, and mentorship opportunities during their early stages of development. According to a study conducted for the Economic Development Administration, investment in business incubators has a large impact on community economic development, with investment in incubators creating
20 times
more jobs than other community investment projects.
Senator Hawley said, “From rural areas to cities, small businesses are a key source of jobs and innovation in our economy. But new small businesses face particular challenges in rural areas. This bill aims to help fix that. By expanding the reach of much-needed resources to help guide rural entrepreneurs, this legislation will help transform more rural startups into successful small businesses.”
Senator Hassan said, “When innovative Granite Staters have an idea for a new business, incubators can play a critical role in helping transform those startups into successful small businesses. As part of my ongoing commitment to helping innovative businesses thrive in New Hampshire and across the country, I introduced this bipartisan bill so that incubators can team up to give even more support to the startups that they work with.”
Senator Hawley and Hassan’s
Incubator Network and Startup Success Act
would create an annual competitive grant program within the Economic Development Agency’s Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The bill would allocate $2 million in annual funding to provide competitive grants of $50,000 to each incubator that is a member of a current or planned network. Networked incubators would be required to raise private capital to match the award 1-to-1 and to demonstrate that awards could be successfully leveraged to expand access to the programs available throughout the network—including in rural areas.

Title: Senator Hawley Demands Answers from FDA as Coronavirus Threatens Drug Shortage
Date: Monday, February 24, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley is sending a letter to U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn demanding answers for how the FDA will mitigate potential drug and medical device shortages. The letter comes after it was reported that the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus has threatened the domestic supply of some 150 prescription drugs, including antibiotics, generics, and branded drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.
In the letter Senator Hawley wrote, “The degree to which some of our own manufacturers rely on China to produce life-saving and life-sustaining medications is inexcusable. It is becoming clear to me that both oversight hearings and additional legislation are necessary to determine the extent of our reliance on Chinese production and protect our medical product supply chain.”
Full text of the letter is available

February 24, 2020
Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.
Commissioner of Food and Drugs
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
10903 New Hampshire Avenue
Silver Spring, MD 20993
Dear Commissioner Hahn:
I write today with increasing alarm about the security of our medical product supply chain. The novel coronavirus in China highlights severe, longstanding, and unresolved vulnerabilities in our capacity to produce life-saving pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for our own citizens. This is unacceptable.
As Axios reported this weekend, the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus has threatened the domestic supply of some 150 prescription drugs, including antibiotics, generics, and branded drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market. The degree to which some of our own manufacturers rely on China to produce life-saving and life-sustaining medications is inexcusable. It is becoming clear to me that both oversight hearings and additional legislation are necessary to determine the extent of our reliance on Chinese production and protect our medical product supply chain.
The FDA plays a key role in ensuring that Americans have safe and uninterrupted access to life-saving medications and I urge that you take swift action to mitigate these shortages. I request your response within the week to the following questions:
What actions has the FDA taken to date to ensure that American citizens do not face shortages of life-saving drugs and medical devices?
What actions will the FDA take in the coming weeks and months to ensure that safe alternatives to any scarce medical products are available for public use?
What additional resources has the FDA devoted to identifying vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical product supply chain?
What additional statutory authority, if any, does the FDA need to require information from manufacturers about the sourcing of component parts, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or scarce raw materials in the medical products they produce?
Will you commit to testifying in congressional hearings about these troubling vulnerabilities in our medical product supply chain and potential policy solutions to keep Americans safe?
Thank you for your work to address this issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Defense Health Agency’s New ‘703 Report’ Protects Military Hospital at Fort Leonard Wood
Date: Friday, February 21, 2020

Content:
The Defense Health Agency (DHA)
released its “703 report” this week, detailing the agency’s recommendations for changes to military treatment facilities across the nation. Following pressure from U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and other members of the Missouri delegation, DHA’s recommendations make sure that the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital (GLWACH) will be able to continue providing beneficiaries with the health care they need. The pressure from Senator Hawley and others came in response to reports that DHA planned to cut the services available at GLWACH.
“The 703 report validates what we already knew—that General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital is essential to Fort Leonard Wood and the region, and the services it provides are irreplaceable. I look forward to continuing to work with the Pentagon to make sure our servicemembers and communities get the quality care they deserve.”
Senator Hawley
Not only will GLWACH continue to provide necessary care at Fort Leonard Wood, the Department of Defense’s FY 2021 budget request
includes $40 million for ongoing construction of new GLWACH facilities. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Hawley will continue to work with his colleagues and the Pentagon to keep this project on track.

Title: Hawley Introduces Legislation to Reauthorize First Comprehensive Study on Human Trafficking in a Decade
Date: Friday, February 14, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
introduced legislation
to reauthorize a provision of the
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005
(TVPRA) commissioning a two-part comprehensive federal study on trafficking in persons by the Department of Justice. While the TVPRA had called for biennial comprehensive studies on the issue, the only study ever completed and submitted to Congress was in 2009. Senator Hawley’s legislation, cosponsored by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), would therefore provide the first comprehensive study of trafficking by the federal government in more than a decade.
“Human trafficking is evil. It is modern-day slavery, and it undermines our most basic values as Americans. There is more that Congress can and should do to end this network of violence and oppression in our communities. It begins with gathering comprehensive data so law enforcement, service providers, and legislators can do their jobs and provide victims the help they need.”
Senator Hawley
As Attorney General of Missouri, Senator Hawley led the
largest human trafficking busts in state history, successfully going after a string of massage parlors in the Springfield-area that served as a front for a sex trafficking ring smuggling victims from Asia. During that time, he also created a first-of-its-kind
human trafficking task force
to coordinate law enforcement efforts and services for victims. He has made it a priority to continue this work in the U.S. Senate.
“Human trafficking is modern day slavery, and is a shameful scourge on our society. In Tennessee, we know all too well how this tragic crime has infiltrated our communities in both the physical and virtual space. In order to confront human trafficking, we need accurate data that informs both law enforcement and Congress and enables us to eliminate it from Tennessee communities.”
Senator Blackburn
“Human trafficking continues to plague communities all across this country, including in my home state of Iowa. We must do more to examine the sources of this sickening form of modern day slavery, and fully eradicate it from our society. By ensuring we have complete, accurate data, I believe we can prevent and protect one more life from being turned upside down by this horrific abuse.”
Senator Ernst
More information on the bill can be found below. This legislation is supported by the U.S. Institute Against Human Trafficking (USIAHT), National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), and Collective Liberty.
“The U.S. Institute Against Human Trafficking supports Senator Hawley’s legislation to provide government research to explain the full breadth and scope of the epidemic of human trafficking in the United States. Data from the study will assist our efforts to raise greater awareness of the issue with federal, state and local officials and the American people by providing comprehensive data on the hundreds of thousands, and potentially over a million, victims trapped in the world of sex trafficking in the United States.”
Kevin Malone, co-founder and President of the Board at the
U.S. Institute Against Human Trafficking
“Fifteen years ago, we knew too little about human trafficking to conduct a successful human trafficking prevalence study, which Congress first mandated in 2005. Today, I’m confident the Department of Justice is ready to solve this perennial mystery. NCOSE strongly supports Senator Josh Hawley’s bill to conduct a study of sex trafficking and labor trafficking that will trigger improvements in law enforcement protocols, direct service provision, and prevention efforts.”
Patrick A. Trueman, president and CEO of the
National Center on Sexual Exploitation
“We support Senator Hawley’s bill for an in-depth examination of the most severe forms of trafficking in persons in the United States, especially sex trafficking and illicit commercial sex acts. It is crucial we update our knowledge of the extent of human trafficking in the United States – our own backyard – to better comprehend the dynamics, who the victims are, how to protect people, and most importantly, how to effectively combat this crime and human rights abuse so that it one day ceases to exist.”
Rochelle Keyhan, CEO of
Collective Liberty
Background
There is too little data on the breadth and scope of trafficking in the United States. This lack of information limits our understanding of the unique characteristics of victims and their trafficking trajectories, and it prevents any meaningful evaluation and research on the effectiveness of government policies to combat trafficking. Section 201 of the
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005
(TVPRA) authorized a biennial comprehensive study on the issue, but only one study has ever been completed and submitted to Congress.
While some methodologies exist to estimate the scope of trafficking in persons in the U.S., there is a large void of comprehensive national, regional, and state data. A federally-funded study completed in 2014 by the Urban Institute estimating “the size and structure of the underground commercial sex economy in eight major U.S. cities” was supposed to investigate victim prevalence, but focused instead on the financial gain of traffickers. This was a major missed opportunity. Other studies have examined more narrowly-focused topics, such as victim prevalence or law enforcement processing of cases, but none have been comprehensive, nor have they been instituted as periodic reports or ongoing data collection programs.
Put simply, in the 20 years since the passage of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Congress has failed to adequately fund comprehensive studies on trafficking. Comprehensive data on the issue is needed to help service providers develop programs, to assist legislators in crafting policies to address trafficking, and to bolster law enforcement’s ability to identify and protect victims – and prosecute perpetrators of this heinous crime. To address these knowledge gaps, Senator Josh Hawley is introducing legislation to reauthorize the 2005 TVPRA’s comprehensive two-part federal study on trafficking.
Part 1
focuses on severe forms of trafficking in persons in the United States, including:
The number and demographic characteristics of victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons;
The number and demographic characteristics of perpetrators of severe forms of trafficking in persons;
The estimated number of investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and incarcerations of persons engaged in acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons by states and their political subdivisions.
Part 2
addresses sex trafficking and unlawful commercial sex acts (CSAs) in the United States and shall include, but is not limited to:
The number and demographic characteristics of perpetrators of sex trafficking and CSAs, including purchasers of commercial sex acts;
The value in dollars of the commercial sex economy, including the average annual personal income derived from sex trafficking acts;
The number of investigations, arrests, prosecutions and incarcerations of persons engaged in sex trafficking and unlawful CSAs, including purchasers of commercial sex acts, by states and their political subdivisions, and a description of the differences in the enforcement of laws relating to unlawful CSAs across the United States.

Title: Senator Hawley Questions FCC on Broadband Access in Rural Missouri
Date: Wednesday, February 12, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) questioning Wisper ISP, Inc.’s progress in expanding access to rural broadband internet in Missouri. In 2018, the FCC awarded Wisper ISP, Inc. $176 million to connect more than 60,000 locations in Missouri with broadband service, but little is known about the current state of the project.
Senator Hawley wrote in his letter, “The need for access to reliable broadband internet in rural areas of Missouri is critical. The latest data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shows 45% of residents in rural parts of my state do not have access to a wired broadband service. Missouri ranked 41st in the country for its limited connectivity. I hear regularly from Missourians who are concerned that their communities are being left behind [. . .] As you and the FCC work in the coming months to administer programs to support rural broadband development, I ask that you answer the questions from many of my constituents who eagerly await services.”

February 12th, 2020
The Honorable Ajit Pai
Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street SW
Washington, DC 20554
Dear Chairman Pai:
I am writing to inquire about the status of broadband deployment in Missouri resulting from the Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF II) auction.
The need for access to reliable broadband internet in rural areas of Missouri is critical. The latest data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shows 45% of residents in rural parts of my state do not have access to a wired broadband service.
[1]
Missouri ranked 41st in the country for its limited connectivity.
[2]
I hear regularly from Missourians who are concerned that their communities are being left behind.
In August of 2018, the FCC announced a CAF II award of more than $254 million to deploy broadband to over 95,000 locations in Missouri with the goal of bringing high speed internet to rural communities that need it most.
[3]
In the wake of the final authorizations to distribute these funds, the real work of connecting Missouri is set to begin by the companies receiving these resources. The majority of these funds went to one company, Wisper ISP Inc, which received $176 million to build in Missouri, one of the largest such awards in the country. The size of this award warrants oversight regarding the company’s ability to fulfill their commitments.
As you and the FCC work in the coming months to administer programs to support rural broadband development, I ask that you answer the questions from many of my constituents who eagerly await services:
Can you provide a specific project update on Wisper ISP Inc’s deployment of service in Missouri?
How many locations out of the more than 60,000 awarded to Wisper ISP, Inc has the company added service to since notification of their award in 2018?
How does the quality of the services added at these locations compare to the quality commitments made by Wisper ISP, Inc?
How does the buildout of Wisper ISP, Inc’s services compare to their original project timeline shared with the FCC? Are they on track?
What oversight will your agency conduct and what reporting requirements are in place to ensure Wisper ISP, Inc. is making sufficient progress toward their obligation?
What safeguards exist to ensure that the funding provided to Wisper ISP, Inc. is not wasted and can be rescinded and reallocated in order to meet the FCC’s broadband access benchmarks for rural Missouri?
Will the locations won by Wisper ISP, Inc. that are not yet receiving service be considered eligible for funding through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund?
You have made your commitment to closing the digital divide clear. I, along with all Missourians, look forward to your answers and to seeing these funds deployed quickly and efficiently to the areas that need them most. Please respond to these questions no later than Wednesday, February 19, 2020.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Proposes to Overhaul the Federal Trade Commission
Date: Monday, February 10, 2020

Content:
For years, Big Tech has gone unchecked due to inaction, weak enforcement, and a lack of accountability at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Congress’s leading voice on tech accountability, is proposing to overhaul the agency by restructuring it to meet the needs of today’s digital markets.
Senator Hawley’s proposal would relocate the FTC to the Department of Justice, making it directly accountable, while strengthening its market analysis and enforcement powers.
While others have proposed creating new unaccountable bureaucracies to address the challenges of digital markets, Senator Hawley takes a bolder approach. His plan overhauls the FTC and focuses its mandates squarely on digital markets, enforcement, and market analysis.
Senator Hawley said, “The FTC isn’t working. It wastes time in turf wars with the DOJ, nobody is accountable for decisions, and it lacks the ‘teeth’ to get after Big Tech’s rampant abuses. Congress needs to do something about it. I’m proposing to overhaul the FTC to make it more accountable and efficient while strengthening its enforcement authority. This is about bringing the FTC into the 21st century.”
Full details can be found
here.
Background
For years, the FTC has stood by as actors in digital markets violated the law to obtain monopoly power.
In a competitive market, extraordinarily high profit margins should not persist because those margins stimulate entry of new competitors over time, causing lower prices. Yet digital markets have been persistently dominated by a few actors who boast extraordinarily high profits. And we are seeing the same pattern in other industries. This trend toward monopolization has occurred on the FTC’s watch.
In 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for inserting anticompetitive biases into its search algorithm and lying about it. A leaked FTC report has revealed that the FTC knew about this conduct as early as 2012 but did nothing. The FTC’s inaction allowed Google to entrench its market share for years using deception.
Google and Facebook have acquired hundreds of companies in the last two decades, yet the FTC never once intervened to try to block any of these acquisitions. Google and Facebook are now some of the biggest companies in the world. Last year, the FTC fined Facebook for flagrantly violating an earlier consent decree—but the fine the FTC touted as a “record” was just 2.5% of the revenue Facebook brought in while violating the earlier decree.
The reality is the FTC is not putting even its current resources to effective use because the FTC is poorly designed.
Senator Hawley’s proposal details several ways to overhaul the FTC:
Accountability
Restructure the FTC to operate within the DOJ
The FTC would be headed by a single Director (like the FBI), instead of a multi-member commission
The Director would report to the Associate Attorney General
The Director would be Senate-confirmed for renewable 5-year terms
The FTC would gain new market analysis authority to direct its enforcement, assist the Antitrust Division, and inform Congress
Transfer all authority to review mergers and acquisitions to the Antitrust Division of the DOJ
Create more tools for robust enforcement
Create authority to enforce rules requiring interoperability, data portability, and data minimization
Create civil penalties for first-time offenses
Give the FTC greater research and reporting mandates
Give state attorneys general concurrent enforcement authority
Ethics
Impose greater ethics requirements and prohibit senior officials from working for or representing large companies for a cooling-off period
Fix constitutional problems

Title: Senators Hawley, Cotton, Banks, Colleagues Urge DOJ to Investigate China Daily
Date: Friday, February 07, 2020

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Congressman Jim Banks (R-Indiana) yesterday in sending a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr requesting the Department of Justice investigate a Chinese Communist Party-owned propaganda outlet, China Daily, for repeated violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The letter cites the political activities of China Daily and the CCP’s financial support of the publication and reads, in part:
“China Daily’s important role in China’s foreign disinformation campaign warrants a full-fledged investigation into the extent of China Daily’s FARA violations. We request that the DOJ promptly review and produce a report on China Daily’s compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We request that the report include a description of China Daily’s potential FARA violations and recommended actions for Congress to consider. We also would appreciate a briefing from DOJ officials on the findings of this report”
The letter was also signed by Senators Ted Cruz (Texas), Mike Braun (Indiana), Rick Scott (Florida), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Marco Rubio (Florida), Kelly Loeffler (Georgia), and Representatives Steve Chabot (Ohio), Gregory Steube (Florida), Scott DesJarlais (Tennessee), Mike Gallagher (Wisconsin), Matt Gaetz (Florida), Michael Waltz (Florida), Dan Crenshaw (Texas), Mike Turner (Ohio), Jody Hice (Georgia), Mike Rogers (Alabama), David Rouzer (North Carolina), Andy Biggs (Arizona), Ralph Lee Abraham (Louisiana), Ralph Norman (South Carolina), Bill Posey (Florida), John Ratcliffe (Texas), Ron Wright (Texas), Van Taylor (Texas), Brian Babin (Texas), Randy Weber (Texas), Joe Wilson (South Carolina), Ted Yoho (Florida), Vicky Hartzler (Missouri), Doug Lamborn (Colorado), Liz Cheney (Wyoming), and Mark Walker (North Carolina).

February 6, 2020
The Honorable William Barr
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20530
Attorney General Barr,
We write to inquire about the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) response to reports of repeated violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) by the Chinese Communist Party-owned propaganda outlet, China Daily.
China Daily presents a distorted account of Chinese Communist Party policy and the Party’s relationship with the United States to an English-speaking audience. The Chinese Communist Party committed $6.6 billion dollars to foreign propaganda efforts in 2009, and according to FARA receipts, has spent over $35 million on China Daily since 2017. China’s massive financial commitment speaks to the seriousness of their effort to sway foreign sentiment.
As part of its effort to push its views into the mainstream, China Daily has paid over 30 independent newspapers to host four to eight page “China Watch” inserts. The inserts contain articles that portray the Chinese Communist Party in a positive light. Some of the articles are harmless—and tout subjects like the Chinese government’s fitness initiative—but some are not. China Daily placed an article in the Wall Street Journal titled “Law-Based Campaign Transforms Xinjiang” and in the Washington Post under the headline “Education Flaws Linked to Hong Kong Unrest.” Such articles serve as cover for China’s atrocities, including its crimes against humanity against Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region and its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong.
China Daily registered as a foreign agent under FARA in 1983. FARA requires foreign agents to provide the DOJ with copies of all propaganda “circulated among two or more persons.” It also requires foreign agents to submit to the DOJ, biannually, an itemized report of their spending inside the United States. As the Washington Free Beacon reported, China Daily repeatedly broke federal laws by failing to properly report its purchase of “China Watch” advertisements.
The report found that China Daily neglected to report any advertisements purchased before 2012, even though a Washington Post spokesperson stated China Daily had been purchasing advertisements in the Post for “more than 30 years.” Additionally, China Daily never gave the DOJ the itemized financial statements for their “China Watch” advertisements that FARA-registered foreign agents are legally required to produce. Instead, China Daily divided its financial activity into two meaningless categories:
“Total Cost of Goods Sold” and “Operation Expenses.” The FARA receipts don’t indicate which outlets China Daily bought advertising space from, or how much money they spent on each advertisement.
General Secretary Xi Jinping is unquestionably committed to shifting foreign perceptions of the Chinese Communist Party. This summer’s NBA boycott and the arson of the Epoch Times headquarters in Hong Kong show the lengths China will go to protect its international image. And China’s financial commitment to foreign propaganda outlets is the proof in the pudding. Propaganda that seeks to obfuscate communist atrocities deserves to be counteracted. But the United States has been puzzlingly slow to respond. Luckily, time-consuming legislation isn’t immediately necessary. FARA already arms the federal government with tools to fight pernicious foreign influence. The DOJ should use them to clamp down on Chinese propaganda.
China Daily’s important role in China’s foreign disinformation campaign warrants a full-fledged investigation into the extent of China Daily’s FARA violations. We request that the DOJ promptly review and produce a report on China Daily’s compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We request that the report include a description of China Daily’s potential FARA violations and recommended actions for Congress to consider. We also would appreciate a briefing from DOJ officials on the findings of this report.
Thank you for considering this important matter of national security.

Title: Senator Hawley Video Statement on Acquittal Vote
Date: Thursday, February 06, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released a video statement following the Senate’s final vote to acquit President Donald Trump. Before the vote, Senator Hawley
took to the Senate floor
to voice his opposition to the articles of impeachment and to challenge the Senate to refocus on the issues important to Missouri and the rest of the country moving forward.
Transcript:
Last night I voted to bring this impeachment fiasco to an end and to acquit the President of the United States. This has been a disaster for our country. It has been a bitter, partisan process that has lasted, if we’re being honest, for three years. Democrats started the impeachment process the day that Donald Trump took his hand off the Bible and was inaugurated as President of the United States.
It’s just gone on for too long. They spent millions of dollars on the Mueller investigation – it came up showing no illegal conduct, nothing done that was wrong. Now we have the same here. The impeachment articles that came over to the United States Senate didn’t even allege unlawful conduct. And they didn’t prove it. I can tell you.
I sat through 70 plus hours of argument. 28,000 pages of evidence were before us in the Senate, including 17 witness statements, and the testimony of witnesses before us. No evidence of any unlawful conduct by the President.
You don’t take a president out of office and overturn an election just because the Democrats don’t like him and who he is. That’s not what impeachment was meant for. It’s time to turn the page and get focused again on what the people of Missouri need.
We need to get prescription drug prices down, in this state and across the United States, and I’ve introduced legislation to do that.
We need to secure our border and stop the flow of illegal drugs like meth from coming into our state. Our schools, our neighborhoods, are awash in methamphetamine. Where’s it coming from? Mexico. We need to secure the border and make sure that that drug flow gets stopped.
We need to expand broadband. Almost 40 percent of our state still doesn’t have access to broadband. This is a huge issue in the 21st century. Kids can’t even do their homework at night. They’ve got to go to McDonald’s just to get an internet connection.
These are the kind of issues that we need to be focused on. There are the kind of issues I can tell you I’m going to be focused on in the year that’s ahead.
I’m glad that impeachment is finally behind us. I hope that the Democrats leave it there and I hope that this will set a precedent that the Constitution is not to be abused for personal, political gain – for partisan, political gain. That’s what the Democrats have tried to do.
It’s enough of that. Let’s get focused on results. Let’s get focused on the needs of the people of Missouri and the people from all over the country.
I look forward to putting my shoulder to that task in these coming months.

Title: Senator Hawley to Submit Trial Questions Focused On Schiff’s Whistleblower Connection & Hunter Biden’s Burisma Work
Date: Tuesday, January 28, 2020

Content:
Following the conclusion of opening statements, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will submit a series of questions during the next phase of the Senate impeachment trial, ranging from House Manager Adam Schiff’s contact with the whistleblower to Hunter Biden’s work with Burisma during the Obama administration:
For House Managers:
As Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House Manager Adam Schiff lied about communications with the whistleblower prior to the filing of the whistleblower complaint. Schiff claimed on September 17, 2019, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” when the whistleblower had in fact reached out to a committee aide prior to filing a complaint. Why did Manager Schiff lie?
For House Managers:
The New York Times reported on October 2, 2019, that Representative Schiff learned the “outlines of a CIA officer’s concerns that President Trump had abused his power” days before the officer actually filed the complaint.
What precisely did Manager Schiff learn in advance?
Did Manager Schiff or any of his staff offer this individual substantive advice on his complaint?
Did Manager Schiff or any of his staff help the intelligence officer draft the complaint in any way or to any degree?
For House Managers:
Since September 9, 2019—the date the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community notified the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that he received a whistleblower’s complaint—please disclose and explain any and all contact that any House Manager or their associates or staff have had with any current or former presidential candidate, or candidate’s campaign staff, in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses?
For House Managers:
Under the House Managers’ theory of an impeachable abuse of power, did then-President Barack Obama or then-Vice President Joe Biden commit such an abuse when the Obama administration withheld aid from the Ukrainian government in exchange for the removal of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General?
For House Managers:
When he took office, Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, vowed to investigate Burisma. Before Vice President Joe Biden sought to remove Shokin, did the White House Counsel’s Office or the Office of the Vice President legal counsel issue ethics advice approving Mr. Biden’s involvement in matters involving Shokin, despite the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board?
For House Managers:
Was President Obama aware that Hunter Biden had been appointed to the board of directors of Burisma when Vice President Joe Biden withheld funds from Ukraine in exchange for the prosecutor’s removal? If so, did the President advise Mr. Biden to recuse himself?
For House Managers:
Do you agree with Hunter Biden’s statement in an October 15, 2019, ABC News interview that he would “probably not” have been named a board member if his “last name wasn’t Biden”?
For White House Counsel:
A significant portion of the House Managers’ theory of abuse of power depends on the idea that President Trump improperly withheld defense aid to Ukraine. Did the White House release the funds in question to Ukraine before they expired at the end of the fiscal year, on September 30, 2019? If so, did the Ukrainian government publicly announce any corruption investigation prior to the release?
For White House Counsel:
What, if any, criminal statutes do the House Managers allege President Trump violated?
After the Senators’ question-and-answer period has ended, the Senate will consider the issue of allowing subpoenas for additional evidence and witnesses.
Should that pass,
Senator Hawley announced on Saturday
that he will issue motions to request documents and witness appearances from House Manager Adam Schiff, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, the whistleblower, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden.

Title: Senator Hawley Continues to Hold VA Accountable for Jefferson Barracks Construction Delays
Date: Monday, January 27, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Robert Wilkie requesting an update on the construction status of the new outpatient clinic building at the St. Louis VA Medical Center-Jefferson Barracks. In August, Secretary Wilkie
told Senator Hawley

In the letter, Senator Hawley wrote, “I am writing now to confirm that the Department is still on track to meet that timeline, and specifically, that the Department has finished construction on the new outpatient clinic building and that the building is still on schedule to begin operations this summer. If construction is not completed or the building is not on schedule to start operations this summer, please provide a detailed explanation for why that is the case and expect further inquiry.”
Full text of the letter is available

The Honorable Robert Wilkie
Secretary of Veterans Affairs
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20420
Dear Secretary Wilkie:
I write as a follow-up to my previous inquiry about the status of the new outpatient clinic building at the St. Louis VA Medical Center-Jefferson Barracks.
On July 2, 2019, I sent you a letter requesting a clear and specific timeline for completion of the new outpatient clinic building at the Medical Center. My request followed reports that the building remained vacant, despite appearing to have been completed in 2017. It was the latest in a series of inquiries made by my office to the Department of Veterans Affairs about ongoing construction at the Medical Center.
In your August 8, 2019, response to my letter, you wrote, “I am pleased to report that the construction for this building is progressing toward completion by the end of 2019, followed by activation which is expected to take approximately 6 months.” My staff confirmed this timeline with the Medical Center’s leadership during a site visit on August 27, 2019.
I am writing now to confirm that the Department is still on track to meet that timeline, and specifically, that the Department has finished construction on the new outpatient clinic building and that the building is still on schedule to begin operations this summer. If construction is not completed or the building is not on schedule to start operations this summer, please provide a detailed explanation for why that is the case and expect further inquiry.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,

Dear Secretary Azar, Secretary Wolf, Secretary Pompeo, and Secretary Chao:
I write to express my concern about the spread of a new strain of coronavirus in China and request guidance on behalf of the American people about when and how the Administration might consider restricting travel to the United States from affected regions of China.
As of Thursday evening, Chinese officials report 830 infections of the virus, 25 of which have been fatal. The virus, which originated in Wuhan, has infected at least one American who recently traveled to the country. Health officials across China have identified multiple other potential cases of infection, and I fear more such infections are yet to come. Unsurprisingly, Chinese officials have reportedly failed to be fully forthcoming with respect to the details of the spread of this virus. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advisers have noted glaring omissions in the data reported by the Chinese about the number of human-to-human transmissions documented and relationships between infected individuals.
I recognize that the public health community has not yet developed a full understanding of the virus’s rate of transmission or case fatality rate and that CDC has a duty to avoid causing undue alarm. That said, in the event that this situation escalates, Americans traveling to and from China may face abrupt disruption. China has already restricted travel to and from Wuhan, leaving foreigners—potentially including many Americans—trapped in the city.
I appreciate that CDC has already initiated screening for the virus at major airports and would urge you to expand this program as aggressively as possible. I also appreciate that CDC has issued a travel advisory for the region. However, I believe Americans deserve advance notice of your plans to evaluate more aggressive limitations on travel between the U.S. and China and of any additional considerations that might lead you to refrain from such measures.
I request your response within the week to the following questions:
Does the federal government have in place procedures and evaluative criteria to guide decisions about restrictions on air travel in the event of disease outbreaks such as this one?
Given the rate at which public health officials are capable of gaining insight into the severity of such an outbreak, can you offer guidance as to when and how the federal government would decide to implement travel restrictions in the event that an outbreak like this one merited them?
Have you begun exploring the means by which the federal government might continue to assist China and the international community in containing this outbreak in the event of restrictions on commercial air travel? If not, why not?
In the event that federal officials make a preliminary determination to rule out restrictions on air travel, will you commit to inform the public that such a determination has been made in the interests of transparency and appropriate public scrutiny?
Thank you for your work to address this issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Navigable Waters Protection Rule, a new definition of the
Waters of the United States Rule
:
“I applaud the Trump administration for replacing the burdensome Waters of the United States rule with new guidelines that put Missourians – not big government – in control. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule gives farmers and ranchers more clarity and states more flexibility in determining how to best to manage their land and water, just as Congress intended with the Clean Water Act. It’s a straightforward approach to protecting our beautiful lakes and rivers without burying everyone in federal regulations.”

Title: Senator Hawley Continues to Demand Answers from FEMA and Army Corps of  Engineers as Flood Season Approaches
Date: Tuesday, January 21, 2020

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley sent letters to the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ask what is being done to prepare for the upcoming flood season. In his letters, Senator Hawley asks for responses to a list of questions on a range of topics, including transparency in FEMA’s Individual Assistance program, the Corps’ preparations for existing levee breaches, and what plans are being made to improve flood control and disaster relief in the future.
In his letter to FEMA, Senator Hawley wrote, “Given that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been slow to restore flood protection to pre-2019 levels, thereby leaving residents vulnerable, what steps is FEMA taking to mitigate the potential disaster? For instance, is FEMA pre-positioning resources in advance of expected storms?”
To the USACE, Senator Hawley wrote, “The National Weather Service is anticipating high levels of precipitation throughout the spring flood season. The forecast looks grim and many Missourians are left without flood protection – leaving them exposed. Due to your inaction, some of my constituents are planning to act on their own to provide at least some level of protection for their homes and businesses. What are you planning to do to protect the vital work of Missouri farmers who are facing decisions about the 2020 planting season?”

January 21, 2020
The Honorable Peter T. Gaynor
Administrator
Federal Emergency Management Agency
500 C Street S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20472
Dear Administrator Gaynor:
As Missouri braces for another flooding season, I am writing to understand what policies, preparation and guidance the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is considering to ensure Missourians’ circumstances are properly understood and that their needs can be efficiently and effectively addressed.
I write as Missouri reels from heavy storms that hit across the state earlier this month, and as many residents continue to rebuild their lives following the devastating historic floods that hit the state last March and April. Although I am grateful for the hard work of the men and women of FEMA, particularly its urban search and rescue teams, I would be remiss if I did not mention serious concerns with FEMA’s record on responding to Missourians’ needs.
In particular, many Missourians, particularly in the northwest of the state, continue to face burdensome challenges with regard to the designation and distribution of Individual Assistance (IA). Not only have there been inconsistencies and opaqueness in determinations of who is awarded IA, but in a number of cases in which constituents were granted IA they were forced to repay it to FEMA due to bureaucratic errors.
The mishandling of IA is one example of a broader disregard by FEMA for the needs of Missourians. A recent article in Mound City News reported that the mishandling of assistance from FEMA caused “[t]hose without flood insurance [to] have been left with what they can scrape together and help from family and friends.”
[1]
That people have been forced to face traumatizing and life-changing circumstances due to flooding is bad enough. That they are then forced to deal with FEMA’s bureaucratic errors and negligence is unacceptable.
In advance of this coming flood season, and in light of the above, I would appreciate your responses to the following questions:
What policies will FEMA institute to ensure it is transparent with respect to the designation and distribution of Individual Assistance?
How will FEMA alter its policies and preparations to ensure Missourians will not face the kinds of bureaucratic negligence and errors that have been reported during the 2019 flooding season?
What processes and policies does FEMA have in place to ensure it is accurately assessing damage, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach parts of the state?
How will FEMA improve its communication with local communities in advance of, during, and following disasters, in light of lessons learned during the 2019 flooding season?
Given that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been slow to restore flood protection to pre-2019 levels, thereby leaving residents vulnerable, what steps is FEMA taking to mitigate the potential disaster? For instance, is FEMA pre-positioning resources in advance of expected storms?
Some in the state have suggested Missouri will not be eligible for disaster aid from flooding in 2020 because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has not repaired the levees. Is this accurate? Other than the sum of the financial losses, what data, such as stream gauges or flood maps, are considered to determine whether FEMA will provide assistance?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your responses and to ensuring that the needs of Missourians are being met in a timely and efficient manner.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator
The Honorable R.D. James
Assistant Secretary for the Army – Civil Works

Lieutenant General Todd T. Semonite
Commanding General and Chief of Engineers
United States Army Corps of Engineers
441 G Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20314-1000
Dear Assistant Secretary James and Lieutenant General Semonite:
I am writing to express my sincere frustration with the Army Corps of Engineers’ failure to repair the damages from the historic flooding which occurred along the Missouri River in 2019 and which threatens to strike again in 2020. The Corps has been trusted with the management of the Missouri River and the people who live and work along the river need your help.
Since the flooding I have been in regular contact with my constituents, whose lives have been upended by these floods, and have seen too little progress on recovery. The Corps update on the status of levee rehabilitation dated January 8, 2020, does not show construction even having begun – much less completed – on 67 levee projects.
[2]
This is unacceptable.
The National Weather Service is anticipating high levels of precipitation throughout the spring flood season.
[3]
The forecast looks grim and many Missourians are left without flood protection – leaving them exposed. Due to your inaction, some of my constituents are planning to act on their own to provide at least some level of protection for their homes and businesses. What are you planning to do to protect the vital work of Missouri farmers who are facing decisions about the 2020 planting season?
Missourians were significantly impacted in the floods of 2019 and there’s been little done to protect Missourians in 2020. Here are a few questions Missourians deserve answers on:
How are you preparing existing levee breaches for the flood risks faced in the spring of 2020?
What temporary structures or measures could benefit those regions currently exposed by levee breaches?
What is the plan to improve flood control on the Missouri River for 2021, 2022, and beyond?
I, along with all Missourians, expect to see a sense of urgency to finish repairs and restore flood control as the top priority for the management of the river so the communities along the Missouri can recover and thrive – without fear – for many years to come.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Steve Daines (Mont.), James Lankford (Okla.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Roy Blunt (Mo.) Mike Rounds (S.D.), James Risch (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Bill Cassidy (La.) and Tim Scott (S.C.) introduced a resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day. This Resolution also commemorates the Virginia Statute’s for Religious Freedom’s 234th anniversary, a statute that laid the foundations for the First Amendment.
“In a time when religious freedom is denied in so many parts of the world, it is an honor to celebrate the right to worship freely as Americans,”
Hawley said. “Across our history, religious freedom has been at the core of who we are, and today we reaffirm our commitment to preserve and protect that freedom for generations to come.”
“It is important we recognize and celebrate the role religious freedom has played in the history of our country and the framework of our constitution,”
Daines said. “In America, we have the right to worship freely and safely, for so many across the world, this fundamental right to religious freedom is suppressed.”

Thomas Jefferson wrote the Virginia Statute’s for Religious Freedom, which passed the Virginia General Assembly on January 16th, 1786. Many historians credit the language of Jefferson’s Statute for inspiring the groundwork for the First Amendment.
Every year since 1992, January 16th has been designated as Religious Freedom Day.

Senator Hawley wrote, “The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 articulates the United States’ commitment to promoting commercial and cultural ties with the people of Taiwan. It likewise enshrines our nation’s commitment to guaranteeing Taiwan’s ability to protect itself from attempts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its will upon Taiwan.

Washington, DC 20016
Dear President Tsai,
I write to congratulate you on your reelection as President of Taiwan. Your administration has been a strong and reliable partner in advancing our societies’ shared values and interests throughout the Indo-Pacific. I am eager to build on that partnership in the coming years.
The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 articulates the United States’ commitment to promoting commercial and cultural ties with the people of Taiwan. It likewise enshrines our nation’s commitment to guaranteeing Taiwan’s ability to protect itself from attempts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its will upon Taiwan. I believe firmly in the principles espoused in that document, and I strongly support Taiwan’s efforts to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights, both at home and abroad.
To that effect, I look forward to working closely with your administration to advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. I will continue to advocate for high-level visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, as well as Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations and other international bodies. Likewise, I will continue to support Taiwan’s efforts to protect itself, especially through its implementation of the New Southbound Policy and the Overall Defense Concept. Finally, I am committed to strengthening U.S.-Taiwanese commercial ties and finding new opportunities both for technological cooperation and for ensuring that critical technologies are kept safe from those who would use them to punish our societies.
Congratulations once more on your reelection. I am confident that your next term will bring only new heights in the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Sens. Cornyn, Lee, Moran Back Sen. Hawley’s Resolution to Allow Dismissal of Articles of Impeachment for Failure to Prosecute
Date: Monday, January 13, 2020

Content:
Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) announced they have cosponsored Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.)
resolution
to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment against President Trump for failure to prosecute.
Senator Cornyn said, “It’s been three weeks and counting since the House passed articles of impeachment, and Speaker Pelosi is still playing games after insisting the President’s removal from office was urgent. This critical change will reinforce the Constitution and help prevent the House from using impeachment for personal political gain like the Speaker is sadly doing now.”
Senator Lee said, “The authors of the Constitution created the impeachment power to be a rarely used constitutional safeguard of the public trust. It was never meant to be a partisan tool used to harass a sitting president. This rule change will limit the House’s ability to play partisan political games with impeachment. If a president is a true threat to the republic, articles to impeach him should be delivered to the Senate with haste.”
Senator Moran said, “Our Constitution guarantees a fair and speedy trial to defendants, and Congress must provide these same guarantees to public officials facing impeachment. Speaker Pelosi has had three weeks to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but instead she is choosing to use the impeachment articles for political gain. This sensible resolution requires the Senate to move forward with impeachment trials in a timely manner and helps prevent Congress from playing political games with the impeachment procedure.”
Last week Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
backed
Sen. Hawley’s resolution, meaning it now has 16 cosponsors including Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

Title: Hawley, Tester Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Ensure VA Infrastructure Better Serves Veterans
Date: Thursday, January 09, 2020

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced a
bipartisan bill
to ensure U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) infrastructure is better suited to provide timely and quality health care to veterans across the country.
The
Build, Utilize, Invest, Lease, and Deliver (BUILD) for Veterans Act
would cut red tape, expedite Congress’ approval process of VA medical leases and provide the Department with more flexibility to lease unused VA property and facilities for veteran-focused services and operations. Among the bill’s many provisions, it would also increase accountability of taxpayer dollars by requiring VA to employ qualified staff in each state, whose sole responsibility would be facility planning and management of all VA construction projects.
Senator Hawley said, “Gridlock in Congress has too often delayed the VA from securing the facilities it needs to provide critical services to our veterans. This bill streamlines the leasing approval process to ensure Missouri veterans can get the care they need, when they need it.”
Senator Tester said, “Too often, veterans–and the dedicated VA employees and medical providers who serve them—find VA facilities outdated or cramped for space. And unfortunately, the process for updating or replacing that space is inundated with red tape. Our bipartisan bill streamlines the process for how Congress approves VA leased space for new facilities in Montana and across the country, and provides VA with more flexibility to utilize unused VA property to benefit veterans. Most importantly, it ensures that VA has the necessary tools, facilities, and staff to provide both quality care to veterans and accountability to taxpayers.”
This bill ensures the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the facilities it needs to provide high-quality care to Missouri’s veterans:
Accelerates delivery of new medical facilities to Missouri’s veterans by streamlining the Congressional approval process for major medical leases.
Allows to VA to lease unused land or property to third parties providing housing, services, and other benefits to Missouri’s veteran community.
Requires every VA medical facility to have dedicated staff for managing construction projects, in order to ensure those projects are done in a timely and responsible manner.
Makes sure the VA takes Missouri’s veterans’ perspectives into account when planning new construction projects in Missouri.
This legislation is supported by Veterans Service Organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), and Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA).
“VA’s infrastructure backlog and unused building lists keep growing by the day,”
said Pat Murray, Deputy Director of VFW’s National Legislative Service. “Senators Tester and Hawley’s
BUILD for Veterans Act
would begin to eliminate these expanding lists and make real changes that would benefit veterans and VA. The VFW thanks Senators Tester and Hawley for their dedication to streamlining the VA infrastructure process by proper future planning, and keeping the best interests of veterans in mind in all future VA infrastructure projects.”
“Veterans who turn to the VA to meet their health care needs should expect that its facilities have been designed and equipped to provide state-of-the-art care,”
said Randy Reese, DAV Washington Executive Director. “However, statutory barriers and VA’s own internal processes have hindered the department’s ability to quickly deliver modern health care facilities for America’s veterans. The
BUILD for Veterans Act
will help cut the red tape involved in modernizing VA’s health care facilities and help ensure veterans receive timelier, high-quality health care. DAV applauds Senators Tester and Hawley for introducing this important legislation.”
“For years, VA’s construction budgets have been significantly underfunded and the department’s internal processes have hindered its ability to meet the ever-growing demand for health care and benefits by veterans,”
said Heather Ansley, PVA Associate Executive Director Government Relations. “Senators Tester and Hawley’s
BUILD for Veterans Act
offers a comprehensive approach that addresses both problems in the most veteran-centric and cost effective way.”

Title: ICYMI: Senator Hawley’s Floor Speech on His Resolution to Dismiss Articles of Impeachment for Failure to Prosecute
Date: Tuesday, January 07, 2020

Content:
Yesterday Senator Hawley gave a speech on the Senate floor where he laid out the case for his
resolution
to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment against President Trump for failure to prosecute. Watch the full speech
here
or below. A full transcript of Senator Hawley’s remarks can be found below.
Senator Hawley said, “In the real world, when a prosecutor brings a case but refuses to try it, the court has the ability — and the defendant has the right, the constitutional right, I might add — to have those articles, those indictments, those charges dismissed. That is precisely the action that I am proposing today. It is time to update the Senate’s rules to account for this unprecedented attempt at obstruction, at denial, at delay.”
Transcript
Madam President, it has been 19 days today. Nineteen days since the House of Representatives impeached the President of the United States. Nineteen days since we were told that it was urgent — that President Trump be impeached and removed from office.
It was urgent for the safety of the country. It was urgent for national security. It was urgent to protect the Constitution of the United States. It was urgent. It had to be done now. The articles had to be rushed through. The rules had to be violated. There couldn’t be due process. It was urgent.
And where are we now? Nineteen days later and the Speaker of the House has still not transmitted the articles to this body for a trial, has still not appointed managers for a trial, has still not exhibited the articles before this body for a trial.
We now have the longest delay in American history in providing notice to this body and actually moving forward with a trial. And now I think we have a better sense of what was urgent.
What was urgent was fulfilling the partisan vendetta that the Speaker of the House and the Democrats have against this president. What was urgent was overturning the results of an election that they have never accepted. That’s what was urgent.
But now, now that it’s trying to actually try the case? Well, now the Speaker and the Democrats aren’t so sure. In fact, now they don’t seem to want a trial. Now that is time to put up or shut up, actually put the evidence forward to be judged, now Speaker Pelosi is saying she may withhold the articles indefinitely–and prevent this body, indefinitely–from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.
After of course, a bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives voted against impeachment. I mean, I think we can probably see the longer we wait why the Speaker is so reluctant now to have a trial. It was a purely partisan process in the House. She had Democrats abandon her, vote with Republicans in a bipartisan coalition against impeachment, and the articles, the articles don’t even allege a crime.
First time in American history, impeachment of a president, where no crime is even alleged in the articles. No evidence of a crime even presented. No wonder she doesn’t want to have a trial. No wonder she is now sitting on the articles and won’t permit a Senate trial to begin.
Well, here’s the problem with that, Madam President. The Constitution of the United States is really clear. The House has the power to impeach; they’ve done that. But the Senate and the Senate alone has the power to try. The Constitution, Article 1 says the Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases. To adjudicate what has happened in the House. To examine the facts and to render a judgment of some sort. And now the House Speaker is attempting to prevent the Senate from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, its constitutional prerogative.
All of this division and rancor, all of this bitterness that she has put the country through now for months on end, she apparently wants to continue indefinitely and deny this body its constitutional responsibility to conduct a trial.
It’s been 19 days. It could be 90 days. It could be 190 days. There is nothing that will stop the Speaker from sitting on these articles indefinitely. They could persist into the president’s second term if and when he is re-elected.
That’s the situation that we are now facing. And if Americans are sick of this impeachment saga, this partisan circus, now? Just wait when we’re still sitting here in October or January of next year, or January of the year following, or who knows when? Without a trial. Without adjudication. Without any resolution.
That’s why, Madam President, it’s time for this body to act.
It is time for the Senate to act to preserve the Constitution’s separation of powers. To preserve the Constitution’s guarantees. The right to due process. The right for the president to be heard. The right for the American people to have these impeachment articles adjudicated, resolved, as the Constitution commits and provides for.
And that is why today, Madam President, I am introducing a resolution to update the Senate’s rules to account for this unprecedented attempt by the Speaker of the House to delay, to deny, to obstruct a trial in the United States Senate.
Let’s be clear, this has never been done before. It’s not even been thought of before. Nobody had thought, before Speaker Pelosi launched this gambit 19 days ago, no one had ever thought that the House could sit on articles of impeachment, indefinitely, in order to stop a Senate trial.
And if the Constitution is going to remain in effect, if the Senate is going to have the power as the Constitution provides, to try cases, if the president is going to get his day in court, if the American people are going to have the ability to have this issue resolved to see the facts, to get a verdict, the Senate has to act.
And so today I’m proposing new rules in the United States Senate that will set a time limit on the actions of the House. It will give the House Speaker 25 days from the date that the articles were adopted and published — 25 days — to transmit those articles here, to the Senate, to exhibit them as the House rules and Senate rules currently speak of and anticipate. And if that is not done, if in 25 days, the House speaker has not acted so that the Senate is able to move forward with a trial, then under my resolution and the change in the rules that I proposed today, the Senate would be able to introduce a motion to dismiss these articles for lack of prosecution.
In the real world, when a prosecutor brings a case but refuses to try it, the court has the ability — and the defendant has the right, the constitutional right, I might add — to have those articles, those indictments, those charges dismissed. That is precisely the action that I am proposing today. It is time to update the Senate’s rules to account for this unprecedented attempt at obstruction, at denial, at delay.
It is time for the Senate to act.
The House has a simple choice in front of it, or it should. That choice is to send the impeachment articles to this body, to be tried before this body, to exhibit the evidence that it has, to make the case that it can — however poor that case may be — but, to make the case that it can, and to allow the American people the right to have this resolution achieved. The right to have the evidence tried. The right to have a verdict rendered. And it is time for the Senate to act to ensure that the constitutional balance of power, that the constitutional separation of powers, and the basic functioning of this government, of our republic, is able to go forward.
This is a matter of great urgency, Madam President. There’s nothing more serious than the attempt to overturn the results of a democratic election, to remove from office a sitting president. And that’s exactly what’s happening now. It is imperative that we act. The country deserves it. It is imperative for future Congresses — for the future of the country — that the Constitution not be subverted in this rush by Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democrats, House Democrats, to remove this president from office without evidence, on no basis, solely for partisan, political purposes.
We must defend the Constitution, Madam President, and we must act now to do so.

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces Resolution to Allow Dismissal of ‘Bogus Impeachment’ Against President Trump
Date: Monday, January 06, 2020

Content:
In response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s unprecedented attempt to prevent an impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today introduced a
resolution
to update Senate rules to allow a motion to dismiss articles of impeachment for lack of prosecution. Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), David Perdue (R-Ga.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) are original cosponsors of the proposed Hawley rule.
Senator Hawley said, “Speaker Pelosi started this bogus impeachment by claiming President Trump was an urgent ‘threat to democracy’ who had to be removed now. But after a bipartisan vote against the articles in the House, and with the public opposed to the Democrats’ partisan games, Pelosi has changed her tune. Now she wants to prevent a Senate trial, perhaps indefinitely. But the Constitution gives the Senate sole power to adjudicate articles of impeachment, not the House. If Speaker Pelosi is afraid to try her case, the articles should be dismissed for failure to prosecute and Congress should get back to doing the people’s business.”
Senator Rick Scott said, “Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are making a mockery of our government. Democrats have wanted to impeach Donald Trump since he came down that escalator four years ago. They just hate Trump. But Chairman Schiff did a great job showing the American people that the President did nothing wrong and that this is just an effort to undo the 2016 election. If Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to send the articles to the Senate, we should dismiss the articles of impeachment and get back to work on all the things that aren’t getting done, like securing the border, passing No Budget, No Pay and lowering the cost of prescription drugs.”
Senator Braun said, “Nearly three weeks ago, Nancy Pelosi and her liberal cohorts voted to impeach President Trump, but rather than fulfill their constitutional duty and send the articles of impeachment to the Senate they’ve opted to play more partisan games. In the real world, it’s put up or shut up, which is why I’m introducing a mandate that forces Speaker Pelosi to deliver the articles of impeachment within 25 days. If Pelosi doesn’t think her case is strong enough to deliver within that timeframe then the Senate should be allowed to dismiss the case so we can get back to real problems like lowering the price of prescription drugs and passing USMCA.”
Senator Blackburn said, “After three years of searching for a reason to impeach this president, Democrats in the House cannot seem to find the time to send over the articles of impeachment. Impeachment ought to be reserved for high crimes and misdemeanors – acts that, if identified, require the timely and prompt removal of a president. If House Democrats are so confident in their findings, they ought to have no problem sending the articles over within a 25 day deadline.”
Senator Cruz said, “Since the start of the impeachment process, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have made a mockery of our Constitution and abused impeachment for political gain. Now, they’re undermining the role of the Senate by attempting to dictate the terms of the Senate’s trial. Under our Constitution, the Senate has the sole authority to try impeachment. It is the Senate’s duty to take up these articles without delay, and to resolve them in a timely and constitutionally appropriate manner.”
Senator Daines said, “It’s time to put up or shut up, and stand up to Nancy Pelosi. House Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching President Trump before he was even sworn into office. First, they rushed through a rigged process, now they have cold feet. Enough with the political games. It’s time to get back to work for Montana and the American people.”
Senator Barrasso said, “Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching President Trump since day one. They know they don’t have a credible case against the president. Speaker Pelosi cannot dictate how the Senate operates. If she refuses to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate should be able to dismiss them.”
Senator Cotton said, “By failing to deliver the articles of impeachment, the Democrats are admitting they bumbled their partisan impeachment. If the articles aren’t delivered in a timely manner, they should be dismissed.”
Senator Ernst said, “Iowans are fed up with this political exercise that’s slowing us down from getting important things done, like passing the USMCA — a trade deal that will create over 175,000 jobs across this country. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have been trying to impeach President Trump since day one, and now after voting on the articles, she’s stalling. Why? Because she knows she made a mistake. Iowans aren’t going to put up with this. Speaker Pelosi and her squad need to send over the articles so that we can get back to the people’s business. This resolution sets an important time table that will allow us to do just that.”
Senator Perdue said, “The Democrats’ impeachment process in the U.S. House of Representatives was nothing more than a partisan show trial. Now, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer are trying to play the same political games in the U.S. Senate. President Trump deserves his day in court, and the Senate is fully-prepared to conduct a fair trial. However, if the House refuses to send over the articles, the Senate should have the ability to dismiss and move on to finding real solutions for the American people.”
Senator Inhofe said, “Democrats continue to prove that the impeachment articles are solely about politics. President Trump has clearly done nothing wrong – there was no abuse of power or obstruction of Congress. But now, Speaker Pelosi and top Democrats want to postpone a Senate trial altogether, maybe even indefinitely. I want to clear President Trump’s name once and for all after this ridiculous and unprecedented impeachment process is over and get back to working on issues that actually matter to families in Oklahoma.”
Senators Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) joined as cosponsors in addition to the 10 original Senators who joined Hawley’s resolution to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment upon introduction.
Senator Loeffler said, “The unfair process in the House and complete lack of evidence revealed during the investigation indicates that the impeachment sham is nothing more than a political attack on a free and fair election. I co-sponsored this resolution because the Senate needs to get past the impeachment sideshow and get back to the business of working for all Americans on the real challenges facing our country.”
Senator Paul said, “House Democrats desperately tried to convince the American people that President Trump had to be impeached, but they have demonstrated their lack of seriousness and respect for the constitutional process they claim to be guarding by withholding the articles from the Senate until they get the trial they want. It is time to put an end to a witch hunt that started based on a hoax. Passing this resolution would not only break the current deadlock, but it would help prevent such partisan games from being played again in future Congresses.”
Background
The Senate has adopted a set of 26 rules that govern all impeachment proceedings, known as the “
Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials.” Those Rules presume prompt delivery of the articles of impeachment to the Senate following their adoption by the House. Historically, the House delivered articles of impeachment to the Senate for action almost simultaneously with the vote to impeach. During the Clinton impeachment, for example, the articles were
transmitted
to the Senate the same day they were approved. Consequently, the current Senate rules have no mechanism to address Speaker Pelosi’s unprecedented attempt to prevent a Senate trial by withholding the articles after the President has been impeached.
Speaker Pelosi’s gambit raises grave constitutional concerns. Article 1, Section 3 gives the Senate the “sole” power to try impeachment cases. But if the Speaker refuses to transmit the articles after the President has been impeached, she could prevent the Senate from exercising its constitutional prerogative, perhaps indefinitely.
Senator Hawley’s resolution would amend the Senate’s impeachment rules to prevent this abuse of the Constitution and protect the Senate’s sole power to try impeachment. The resolution would allow the Senate to dismiss for lack of prosecution any articles of impeachment that the House of Representatives has delayed transmitting for 25 calendar days or more. Under this new rule, any Senator would be entitled to move to dismiss once the allotted time period had elapsed. Any motion to dismiss would be voted upon by the full Senate.
Text of the proposed Hawley rule:
Title: Amending the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials.
Resolved, That rule I of the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials is amended to read as follows:
“I. Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the House of Representatives that managers are appointed on their part to conduct an impeachment against any person and are directed to carry articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate shall immediately inform the House of Representatives that the Senate is ready to receive the managers for the purpose of exhibiting such articles of impeachment, agreeably to such notice.
If, following adoption of such articles, the House of Representatives does not so notify the Senate or otherwise provide for such articles to be exhibited to the Senate within 25 calendar days from the date of adoption of such articles, as recorded in the Journal of the House of Representatives, such articles shall be deemed exhibited before the Senate and it shall be in order for any Senator to offer a motion to dismiss such articles with prejudice for failure by the House of Representatives to prosecute such articles. Such motion shall be adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators, duly chosen and sworn, without debate by the yeas and nays, which shall be entered on the record.”.

Title: Senator Hawley Statement on House Impeachment Vote
Date: Thursday, December 19, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement after the House approved articles of impeachment against President Trump:
“With last night’s vote, House Democrats have earned a place in history for the worst abuse of the impeachment process ever perpetrated. They have ignored due process, ignored House procedures, and ignored the evidence on their way to adopting the first impeachment articles against a president in history that do not even bother to allege a crime. With a bipartisan coalition voting against impeachment, now they are threatening not to hold a trial. They have harmed the country and disgraced both themselves and the House with their rabidly partisan crusade, and the voters should reward them accordingly in November.”

Title: Senator Hawley Praises Passage of Bill to Curb Robocalls
Date: Thursday, December 19, 2019

Content:
Today the United States Senate unanimously passed the conference report of the
Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED) Act, sending the bill to President Trump’s desk. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is a cosponsor of the
TRACED Act, which will crack down on the illegal robocalls that inundate Missourians every day. The final version of the legislation includes a
proposal
from Senator Hawley and Senator Susan Collins that will make it easier to prosecute criminal robocallers by extending the statute of limitations for illegal spoofing.
“Criminal robocallers have been hounding and ripping off Missourians for far too long,”
said Senator Hawley. “This legislation will help block illegal robocalls and hold these fraudsters accountable.”
Background
In recent years, scammers have flooded the U.S. telecommunications network with robocalls. In 2018, there were nearly 50,000 complaints to then-Attorney General Hawley’s office about illegal telemarking calls, topping the list of
consumer complaints
for that year.
The TRACED Act, originally introduced by Senator John Thune and Senator Ed Markey, takes aim at this epidemic by increasing civil forfeiture penalties on illegal robocallers, eliminating restrictions on regulators, and requiring that voice service providers adopt new call authentication technology to verify incoming calls at no cost to the consumer.
Senator Hawley’s Provision
In July 2019, Senator Hawley joined Senator Susan Collins and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in introducing the
Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act of 2019. This legislation would crack down on illegal spoofing, a tactic often used by robocallers to trick victims into answering phone calls by manipulating Caller ID data. Like Senator Hawley’s bill, the final conference report of the
TRACED Act
includes a provision to extend the statute of limitations for illegal spoofing.

Title: On Sino-British Joint Declaration Anniversary, Hawley Leads Bipartisan Letter Urging U.N. to Raise Issue of China’s Human Rights Violations
Date: Thursday, December 19, 2019

Content:
On the 35th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today sent a letter with his colleagues to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, urging him to raise the issue of China’s violations of human rights and its destruction of its documentary record in both his discussions with member states and at the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council. Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Todd Young (R-Ind.) also signed onto the letter.
The letter comes on the anniversary of the Dec. 19, 1984 signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration—a bilateral agreement that was registered at the U.N. which defined the terms of the “one country, two systems” principle that would protect Hong Kong’s autonomy as it transferred from British to Chinese authority.
The Senators’ letter today states “China’s actions in Hong Kong are consistent with its actions in other parts of the region and its treatment of those within its borders who may hold different beliefs from those of the Communist Party of China. Its detention camps in Xinjiang holding nearly a million Uyghur Muslims reflect China’s true ambitions.”
They continue, “We the undersigned urge you to work with both member states and with the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council to take meaningful steps to condemn China’s operation of its detention camps in Xinjiang and to protect the documentary record of what is taking place in Xinjiang. Your actions on this matter will be a testament to the United Nations’ important mandate of protecting human rights wherever they are threatened.”
Last month violence at PolyU Hong Kong drew international attention, leading Senator Hawley to
suggest China was in violation
of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Shortly after Senator Hawley
called on U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft
to consider options at the U.N to hold Beijing accountable for treaty and human rights violations in Hong Kong.
The letter sent today is available
here
and below.
December 19, 2019
The Honorable António Guterres
Secretary-General of the United Nations
United Nations Headquarters
New York, NY 10017
Dear Mr. Secretary-General:
Thirty-five years ago today the United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of China signed the Joint Declaration – a bilateral agreement that was registered at the United Nations which defined the terms of the “one country, two systems” principle that would protect Hong Kong’s autonomy as it transferred from British to Chinese authority in 1997. In the decades since, and in particular during both the Umbrella movement in 2014, the unraveling of the Legislative Council elections in 2016, and over the last six months, Beijing has systematically violated core aspects of Hong Kong’s autonomy, from violently silencing demonstrators to interfering in local elections to imposing on Hong Kong’s judicial independence. Simply put, China has repeatedly demonstrated cavalier disregard for its treaty commitments, including those registered at the United Nations.
China’s actions in Hong Kong are consistent with its actions in other parts of the region and its treatment of those within its borders who may hold different beliefs from those of the Communist Party of China. Its detention camps in Xinjiang holding nearly a million Uyghur Muslims reflect China’s true ambitions. Last month, over 400 pages of leaked internal documents published in The New York Times
revealed
harrowing examples of how Chinese officials issued guidance for surveillance and population control, including requiring that Chinese bureaucrats threaten that students’ behavior could impact their relatives’ detention, and that their parents’ faith is a “virus’ in their thinking” which requires that authorities “show absolutely no mercy.”
This week, in response to The New York Times report about these documents, Chinese authorities reportedly began a campaign to systematically destroy all documentation related to its internment camps in Xinjiang. According to The Associated Press, Chinese officials were
reportedly instructed
to “burn paper forms containing sensitive personal details on residents in their area, such as their detention status, and for various state offices to throw away computers, tighten management of classified information, and ensure all information related to the camps is now stored on databases disconnected from the internet in special, restricted access rooms to bar hackers.”
Mr. Secretary-General, when asked about the detention camps in Xinjiang earlier this year you rightfully
insisted
that “it is necessary for human rights to be respected,” and that “it is very important to act in a way that each community feels that their identity is respected and that they belong, at the same time, to the society as a whole.” The United States and twenty-two countries at the United Nations
came together
to push for holding China accountable for its actions in Xinjiang.
Mr. Secretary-General, as representatives of the U.N.’s principal founding member and largest contributor, we the undersigned urge actions by the United Nations to hold China accountable for its human rights violations. Specifically, we ask that you work with both member states and with the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council to take meaningful steps to condemn China’s operation of its detention camps in Xinjiang and to protect the documentary record of what is taking place in Xinjiang. Your actions on this matter will be a testament to the United Nations’ important mandate of protecting human rights wherever they are threatened.
If you take these actions we stand ready to work with you to ensure China’s ruthless disregard for international norms and basic liberties will have consequences.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
John Cornyn
Marco Rubio
Rick Scott
Thom Tillis
Edward J. Markey
Ted Cruz
Todd Young

The Honorable Ambassador Kelly Craft, Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations

Title: Senator Hawley Applauds Passage of Bill to End Rape Kit Backlog
Date: Wednesday, December 18, 2019

Content:
Last night the Senate unanimously passed the Debbie Smith Act of 2019, a bill that authorizes crucial grant funding to help state crime labs work through their backlogs of untested DNA samples, including rape kits. The bill now heads to the President’s desk. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), an original cosponsor of the Debbie Smith Act, issued the following statement:
“Far too often, survivors of this horrendous crime go through the invasive process of completing a rape kit only to have the evidence that could put their attackers away sit on a shelf for years on end. This bill gives law enforcement the resources they need to deliver justice to these brave survivors.”
In May, Senator Hawley
spoke in support of the bill
as it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. A
video
of his remarks is below.
While Attorney General of Missouri, Senator Hawley conducted a
statewide audit
of rape kits where he found that the state had more than 5,000 untested kits. The state was then able to secure the necessary federal funding to tackle this backlog and to begin to set up a statewide rape kit tracking system.

Title: IG Horowitz to Sen. Hawley: There Was Potential Bias In FBI Counterintelligence Investigation Against Trump Campaign
Date: Wednesday, December 18, 2019

Content:
Today during a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his report detailing widespread FISA application abuse by the FBI during its 2016 counterintelligence investigation against the Trump campaign. Under questioning from Senator Hawley, IG Horowitz left the door open to the possibility that bias against the Trump campaign played a role in the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation.
Sen. Hawley:
“Was it your conclusion that political bias did not affect any part of the Page investigation, any part of Crossfire Hurricane?”
IG Horowitz:
“We did not reach that conclusion.”
Sen. Hawley:
“Because I could have sworn, in fact, I know for a fact that I’ve heard that today from this committee. That’s not your conclusion?”
IG Horowitz:
“We have been very careful in the connection with the FISA’s for the reasons you mentioned to not reach that conclusion in part – as we’ve talked about earlier – the alteration of the email, the text messages associated with the individual who did that, and our inability to explain or understand, to get good explanations so that we could understand why this all happened.”
Sen. Hawley:
“I think we’re left with two possibilities here. You have three different investigative teams as you testified earlier, you’ve got a dozen people at the FBI, you’ve got the decisions made over time to mislead the FISA court. Either these people were really incompetent and bad at their jobs or they had an agenda that they were pursuing. And having an agenda – I don’t care what word you put in front of it – political agenda, personal agenda, but whatever it is, it is antithetical to democracy.”

Title: Sen. Hawley: Democrats Bought A Federal Investigation of The Trump Campaign
Date: Thursday, December 12, 2019

Content:
Today on Fox & Friends Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said the Democrat National Committee was essentially able to purchase a federal investigation of the Trump Campaign. Senator Hawley’s comments follow revelations that the FBI used Christopher Steele’s Democrat-funded dossier to trigger its application to the FISA court to spy on a Trump campaign official.
Senator Hawley said, “Essentially the Democrat Party bought themselves an FBI investigation. The Democrats went out and paid for this fake dossier, they fed it to the FBI, and the FBI used it to get surveillance of the Trump campaign during a presidential election. This has never happened before in American history, and the Horowitz report, the IG report, is really damning. It shows that the FBI bought this hook, line, and sinker.”
Senator Hawley also expressed skepticism that only low-level FBI case agents were involved in the surveillance of the Trump presidential campaign.
Senator Hawley said, “You cannot tell me that case agents – mid-level, low-level case agents – opened up the surveillance program without the supervision of say the Attorney General or the President of the United States. I think we need to find this out. What did the Attorney General know, Loretta Lynch, what did the President Barack Obama, what did he know? Are we really to believe that the FBI is conducting a surveillance campaign during an election of a political opponent and the White House doesn’t know anything about it? I think we gotta find that out.”

Title: Hawley Cosponsors Bill Imposing Sanctions on Drug Cartels
Date: Wednesday, December 11, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) along with Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) today introduced the Significant Transnational Criminal Organization Designation Act, legislation that would subject certain foreign criminal organizations like drug cartels to sanctions, including immigration, financial, and criminal penalties. The process would be similar to the system used for designating entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs).
Senator Hawley said, “Violent Mexican cartels have gotten rich by flooding our communities with addictive drugs that are ruining lives and tearing families apart. Unfortunately, the Mexican government has been unwilling or unable to stop these criminals. Enough is enough. This bill will beat back the cartels by freezing their assets, removing them from the country, and sanctioning anyone who helps sustain their criminal enterprises.”
Senator Cotton said, “Criminal organizations and drug cartels like the one responsible for last month’s attack in Mexico ought to be treated just like terrorist groups in the eyes of the U.S. government. This bill would help stop cartel violence by ensuring these groups–and anyone who helps them–face dire consequences for their actions.”
Background
The Significant Transnational Criminal Organization Designation Act enables the federal government to impose on the most significant Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) the same sanctions that apply to FTOs including:
Barring organization members and their immediate families from admission to the United States.
Freezing assets.
Seeking civil and criminal penalties against Individuals providing material assistance or resources to the organization.
The bill also requires the President to submit a report to Congress with the government’s findings on the November 4, 2019 attack on U.S. citizens in northern Mexico once the investigation is completed, including whether the organization responsible should be designated a Significant TCO.

Title: Sen. Hawley: IG Report Shows FBI “Effectively Meddled” in 2016 Campaign By Investigating President Trump
Date: Wednesday, December 11, 2019

Content:
Today during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his report detailing widespread misconduct related to the 2016 counterintelligence investigation against the Trump campaign.  Senator Hawley expressed deep concern about the revelation that the FBI doctored evidence to obtain a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign official asking, “Is it worse to have a foreign government trying to meddle in our elections, or is it worse to have our own government meddling in the election?”
Sen. Hawley also asked Inspector General Horowitz if this was the first time the FBI used partisan-funded opposition research to obtain FISA warrants against an American presidential campaign saying, “The DNC pays for the Steele Dossier, solicits the Steele Dossier, and then gets the Federal Bureau of Investigation to go get FISA warrants, surveil an American citizen, and surveil a presidential campaign all on the basis of this manufactured garbage that they paid for. I mean that’s extraordinary. That has got to be a first time in history. In fact let me just ask you, Mr. Horowitz, are you aware of ever of another presidential campaign being targeted by the FBI like the Trump campaign was?”
Inspector General Horowitz told Senator Hawley that to his knowledge that to his knowledge this was the first time a presidential campaign had been targeted in this manner.

Title: Hawley, Colleagues Urge Olympic Committee to Hold China Accountable and Ensure Human Rights Upheld at 2022 Beijing Olympics
Date: Friday, December 06, 2019

Content:
As Beijing prepares to host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, the international community remembers the human rights abuses that occurred during China’s 2008 tenure as host.
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) are urging the International Olympic Committee to implement its Host City Contract requirements in time for the Beijing Games instead of the current timeline of 2024. The new guidelines, among other requirements, hold host cities to international human rights norms and standards.
“We hold great concern that the People’s Republic of China, a country plagued with violent suppression of free speech, state-sponsored oppression, and human rights abuses, is set to serve as host to the 2022 Olympic Winter Games without proper guidelines or requirements,” the Senators write.
“Rightfully present in the revised Host City Contract under the Olympic Agenda 2020 is an address of the host city’s respect of human rights,” the Senators continue. “These revised Host City Contract requirements include protection of human rights and labor-related protections, as well as the assurance that all violations of human rights, fraud, or acts of corruption are remedied in accordance with applicable international agreements, laws, and regulations.”
China executed its 2022 Host City Contract in 2015, approximately seven months after the new guidelines were agreed to, but years before full implementation was expected. China did implement some of the non-human rights related
new Host City Contract requirements
in its contract, but has not complied with it in totality.
The letter is available below and
here.
Mr. Thomas Bach
President, International Olympic Committee
Château de Vidy
Case Postale 356
1001 Lausanne
Switzerland
Dear Mr. Bach:
We write to express support of the International Olympic Committee’s Olympic Agenda 2020 and request its immediate full implementation. Specifically, we hold great concern that the People’s Republic of China (PRC), a country plagued with violent suppression of free speech, state-sponsored oppression, and human rights abuses, is set to serve as host to the 2022 Olympic Winter Games without proper guidelines or requirements.
For years, host cities have unfortunately committed human rights abuses in accordance with the preparation and conducting of the Olympic Games. In response to these concerning trends, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), in December 2014, unanimously agreed to adopt the Olympic Agenda 2020. This document maintains that Olympic principles are United Nations principles; one reform included in adhering to these international principles is an overhaul to the Host City Contract requirements to be fully implemented by 2024.
The Olympic Agenda 2020 and its corresponding Host City Contract requirements were unanimously adopted seven months prior to the awarding of the 2022 Olympic Games to Beijing, PRC, and the execution of its Host City Contract. As part of the host city selection process, the IOC considers “whether the Games would leave a positive legacy that meets the individual needs and long-term development goals of the respective city and region.”  Further, the IOC’s Olympic Charter holds that “The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind,” making the host city a crucial piece of the puzzle.
Rightfully present in the revised Host City Contract under the Olympic Agenda 2020 is an address of the host city’s respect of human rights. These revised Host City Contract requirements include protection of human rights and labor-related protections, as well as the assurance that all violations of human rights, fraud, or acts of corruption are remedied in accordance with applicable international agreements, laws, and regulations.
Delaying application of imperative guidelines like these until the 2024 Olympic Games leaves China free reign in 2022. China has made evident their exploitation of human labor and violation of human rights. Two most recent examples are the 403 pages of internal Chinese Communist Party (CCP) documents published by the New York Times outlining the CCP’s “ruthless and extraordinary campaign” to organize the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims within its borders   as well as a classified list of guidelines for operating the camps revealed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – both revealed in November 2019.
Furthermore, we also ask that you look to Beijing’s past actions when entrusted with the Olympic torch. The Department of State in its annual Report on Human Rights Practices identified a peak in human rights abuses around the 2008 Olympic Games.  This report documents forced relocations linked to Olympic infrastructure construction; mandatory travel abroad or house arrest for political prisoners during the Games; increased surveillance of civil society organizations and suspension of meetings and activities by NGOs; increased harassment of religious groups, including prominent Christian activists; directives to schools and universities regarding guardrails for political and social discourse leading up to and during the Olympics; heightened harassment, detention, and incarceration of dissidents; restrictions on the right to assemble and raise grievances; and other abuses.
Additionally, an international NGO documented – and a Chinese governmental investigation later confirmed – eight cases of child labor utilized by Lekit Stationary Company to produce 2008 Olympics-branded and -licensed goods. These actions clearly all fall out of the bounds of international norms regarding human rights practices and would be in violation of the new Host City Contract requirements.
Host City Contract requirements also include close cooperation between Olympic committees and the host city and its authorities in the areas of media, information and knowledge management, and rights protection. Prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chinese propaganda authorities issued a 21-point directive outlining how domestic media could report on the Olympics, including a ban on reporting on Tibetan and Uyghur movements, a prohibition from noting the lifting of censorship of Western websites just during the time of the Olympics, and a blanket requirement to report positively on Olympic security arrangements.
The Foreign Correspondent’s Club of China also noted a spike in the weeks prior and during the Olympics in infringement by local authorities on the freedom of foreign journalists – including the beating of two Japanese journalists, abuse of Hong Kong journalists, and detention of two Finnish journalists as well as other foreign correspondents.
Therefore, we call on the International Olympic Committee to implement the Host City Contract requirements as outlined in the Olympic Agenda 2020 to all contracts applied to Olympic Games occurring after January 1, 2020. We understand that this implementation would apply both to the execution of new Host City Contracts and to the update of existing Host City Contracts. These guidelines have been prepared for six years, and were publically available prior to Beijing signing its July 2015 Host City Contract, providing all prospective and current host nations ample time to consider the requirements. Any nation enjoying the opportunity to “promote of its image on the world stage” should be held to the utmost standards of human rights and freedom. The Olympic Games are a shining example of the best that humans can be. We urge you to allow this to be true across all arenas and implement the most current Host City Requirements for each forthcoming Games.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Title: Senator Hawley Presses Pentagon on Contradictory Statements Regarding Middle East Troop Expansion
Date: Thursday, December 05, 2019

Content:
Today during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) pressed Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood on
reports
that the United States is considering sending as many as 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.
Last night the Pentagon
told
Senator Hawley the “U.S is not
considering
sending 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.” Today Under Secretary Rood
told
Senator Hawley that the Pentagon is considering sending additional troops to the Middle East. In response to these contradictory statements, Senator Hawley asked Secretary of Defense Mark Esper for clarification. Senator Hawley also
pressed
Under Secretary Rood on what “stability” looks like in the Middle East and what our goals are in the region.
A transcript of the exchange can be found below.
HAWLEY
: I have to confess that you’ve confused me in your responses first to the Chairman and then to Senator Blackburn. I think you just said to Senator Blackburn that the Pentagon is considering additional troops to CENTCOM. Now that confuses me because the Pentagon spokesperson said last night in direct to response to me that the Pentagon is not considering sending additional troops to CENTCOM. So let me ask you again, is the Pentagon considering additional troops to CENTCOM?
ROOD
: Senator, we’re always considering changes to our force posture, not only in CENTCOM, but in other…
HAWLEY
: So the Pentagon spokesperson in responding to me last night publicly misspoke, is that what you’re saying? Let me just read to you what she said, – she said, “To be clear, the reporting [about the Wall Street Journal report] is wrong. The U.S. is not considering sending 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.” But you just told Senator Blackburn that that is under consideration. And that was in direct response to me. So I’d like a direct answer. Are you considering it or not?
ROOD
: The direct answer I’d give you, Senator, is that we’re always considering and in fact based on the threat situation in the Middle East are watching that and as necessary the Secretary of Defense has told me he intends to make changes to our force posture there. With respect to that statement by the spokesperson, we have not made a decision to deploy 14,000 troops.
HAWLEY
: Well, that wasn’t what she said though, she said it’s not – so, you’re telling me now that she misspoke. I think at this point it would be helpful to hear from the Secretary on this issue. And I’d like to hear from him today on this issue. I assume that he signed off on the official spokesperson’s comments – direct public comments last night to me – which she repeated over and over again, and you’ve directly contradicted here, this morning, multiple times. So, I think some clarification is in order and I’d like to have it. I’d like to have it in public. Because the Pentagon has now made multiple contradictory public statements. Can we do that? Can we get that done today?
ROOD
: I’ll talk to the Secretary of Defense about that.
HAWLEY
: Great.
ROOD
: I do want to say Senator, I wouldn’t agree with your characterization that I have directly contradicted the spokesperson.
HAWLEY
: Well how can that be the case when she says the United States is not considering sending additional troops to the Middle East and you just said that you are.
ROOD
: Um. I believe her statement was we’re not considering 14,000 troops.
HAWLEY
: Right. So, wait, I’m sorry, what’s your testimony then? Your testimony’s different from that, because you just told Senator Blackburn that that is under consideration.
ROOD
: For example Senator there isn’t some pending document with the Secretary of Defense that states “deploy 14,000 troops. Do you approve: Yes or No?” I’m not trying to be argumentative, sir. I’m just trying to point out there is a dynamic security situation in the Middle East and that it’s a custom that we do, and we didn’t do it just because of recent of events, where we regularly evaluate the appropriate number of…
HAWLEY
: Well, I’m hearing what you’re saying, but there is a pretty direct contradiction here. You’re telling me, have told me, have told Senator Blackburn, that this is under consideration. The Pentagon spokesperson said last night that it’s not. So, I’ll let you all circle up, and talk to one another, and then issue a public statement today clarifying this, preferably form the secretary.

Title: Senator Hawley Asks U.S. Attorney, HUD for Federal Investigation into Kansas City Public Housing
Date: Friday, November 22, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent letters to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson and U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Timothy Garrison asking for investigations of public housing in the Kansas City region. These letters come after recent news reports documented the conditions residents of T.E.H. Realty’s properties across the state face from “significant rodent infestations, to mold, to systems that leave residents with no source of heat during the winter.”
In the letter, Senator Hawley wrote, “These news stories report that large companies managing housing complexes for predominantly low-income Missourians in Kansas City are failing to maintain units in habitable conditions, evicting tenants at higher than normal rates, and failing to pay utilities bills that are the landlord’s responsibility, leaving hundreds of residents potentially without heat.”
He continued, “I therefore ask HUD to work with local housing authorities to ensure that residents who are affected by bad management companies receive all interim relief to which they are entitled, including Tenant Protection Vouchers and Enhanced Vouchers. Providing these benefits would enable residents to obtain adequate housing with minimal disruption and with the opportunity to stay in their communities.”
Yesterday, he
sent similar letters
to HUD and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeffrey Jensen asking for investigations of public housing in the St. Louis region

November 22, 2019
The Hon. Benjamin S. Carson
Secretary
Department of Housing and Urban Development
451 7th Street S.W.
Washington, DC 20410
Dear Secretary Carson:
I write following disturbing reports of unacceptable housing conditions in the Kansas City region. For years, residents in the region have had to put up with conditions ranging from significant rodent infestations, to mold, to systems that leave residents with no source of heat during winter. These conditions are widespread, persistent, and affect residents across the state. As Attorney General of Missouri, for example, I brought a lawsuit against a management company following reports that nearly half the units in a complex it managed were infested with rodents.
[1]
Recent reports suggest that these housing problems have not only remained—they have become worse in the Kansas City region. These news stories report that large companies managing housing complexes for predominantly low-income Missourians in Kansas City are failing to maintain units in habitable conditions, evicting tenants at higher than normal rates,
[2]
and failing to pay utilities bills that are the landlord’s responsibility, leaving hundreds of residents potentially without heat.
[3]
Recently, the Housing Authority of Kansas City cut off future Section 8 eligibility for at least one large housing company, TEH Realty, for the company’s “history and pattern of non-compliance.”
[4]
Conditions may be even worse than what these reports suggest. When some landlords neglect their duties, tenants often will not bring complaints. Eviction is a cause, and not just a symptom, of poverty. And many of these tenants fear that, if they raise complaints, a landlord will evict them, either illegally or pretextually over a small-scale infraction. That concern is especially severe when residents live in complexes managed by companies with higher than normal eviction rates.
These reports of housing conditions in the Kansas City region warrant a thorough investigation by your agency. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) provides critical housing resources to the landlords of millions of Americans. But HUD provides those resources for the benefit of the tenants, and taxpayer dollars should not go to landlords who do not provide even basic levels of acceptable housing. I ask that HUD conduct a thorough investigation of publicly managed housing complexes and landlords receiving federal funds in the Kansas City region, including Section 8 funding, who are failing to meet their obligations to provide quality housing.
At the same time, HUD should not cut off funding from bad property management companies without providing reciprocal support to the tenants harmed by those facilities. The Department must not compound harm to low-income residents by terminating relationships with bad management companies in a way that would risk making residents even worse off.
I therefore ask HUD to work with local housing authorities to ensure that residents who are affected by bad management companies receive all interim relief to which they are entitled, including Tenant Protection Vouchers and Enhanced Vouchers. Providing these benefits would enable residents to obtain adequate housing with minimal disruption and with the opportunity to stay in their communities.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Bipartisan Letter To President Trump Requesting He Take Immediate Action To Suspend Approval Of Licenses That Allow Some U.S. Companies To Do Business With Huawei
Date: Thursday, November 21, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) joined a bipartisan letter to President Trump, expressing deep concern that the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun
issuing
export licenses to U.S. firms to resume business with Huawei Technologies—despite the significant threats these license approvals could pose to our national security. Leader Schumer and Senator Cotton write that approving these licenses, and others, will allow Huawei to fully resume its engagement with certain U.S. firms without an adequate assessment of the risks to national security. Senator Hawley joined the letter with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR), Senator Chris Van Hollen, (D-MD), Senator Rick Scott (R-FL), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Senator Ben Sasse (R-Ne.), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Senator Doug Jones (D-AL).
The Senators note that the Department of Commerce’s recent announcement comes after President Trump
said
he had no interest in doing business with Huawei, and emphasizes that national security experts widely agree that Chinese companies cooperate heavily with the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government is thought to exercise considerable influence over Huawei, in particular.
The Senators write that the approval of these export licenses would undermine the original intent of the Entity List designation, allowing Huawei to continue to pose a serious threat to U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and national security more broadly, and request that the Department of Commerce suspend the granting of licenses to U.S. companies until they provide Congress with a report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat, and that Congressional leadership and relevant committees be notified prior to the issuance of any licenses to U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei and its affiliates.
The Senators’ letter to President Trump can be found
here
and below:
November 21, 2019
President Donald Trump
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President:
We write to express our concern that the Department of Commerce has begun to issue licenses to some U.S. firms that conduct business with Huawei Technologies. Given the security risks posed by Huawei’s operations in the U.S., we request that you take immediate action to suspend the approval of such licenses and ensure Congress is appropriately informed about the license approval process and related national security implications going forward.
On May 16, 2019, Huawei – the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world – and 68 of its affiliates were added to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List for reasons of national security. To date, the Entity List includes 115 Huawei companies. This designation serves to effectively prohibit the export and transfer of certain U.S. goods and technology to Huawei.
On November 18, 2019, the Department of Commerce announced that it would be extending the Temporary General License for U.S. companies engaged in specific business activity with Huawei. While we disagree with this decision, we are even more concerned that the approval of additional, more permanent licenses will allow Huawei to fully resume its engagement with certain U.S. firms without an adequate assessment of the risks to national security.
It is our understanding that the Department of Commerce has begun to send out 20-day intent to deny letters and some approvals for specific licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to Huawei. Though licenses are to be granted under a presumption of denial, Secretary Ross
said previously
that the Department will approve “quite a few” of the license requests that were received, of which there are nearly 300.
Mr. President, Secretary Ross has expressed that this decision was made to implement your G-20 Summit directive announced this June. However, you have said yourself that you did not want the U.S. doing business with Huawei. National security experts widely agree that Chinese companies cooperate heavily with the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government is thought to exercise considerable influence over Huawei, in particular.
Consequently, we believe that the approval of these export licenses would undermine the original intent of the Entity List designation, allowing Huawei to continue to pose a serious threat to U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and national security more broadly.
We therefore request:
The Department of Commerce suspend the granting of licenses to U.S. companies until providing Congress with a report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.
That Congressional leadership and relevant committees be notified prior to the issuance of any licenses to U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei and its affiliates.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.

Title: Senator Josh Hawley’s Speech at the 6th Annual American Principles Project Gala
Date: Wednesday, November 20, 2019

Content:
Speech text as prepared for delivery:
I am humbled tonight to accept an award named for a man who spent his life speaking for those without a voice, fighting for the weak, challenging the strong, and defending till the end of his days the goodness and decency of the common man and woman.
Such is the legacy of Jeff Bell. He understood the times in which we live because he understood the longing of every person to find fellowship, to forge community, to build a home. And he understood that our liberty depends on whether those longings can be fulfilled.
And that is what I want to talk with you about tonight.
We live in a troubled age. Every American knows it, feels it.
Discontent is the theme of our politics, the preoccupation of our popular culture. It is the very air we breathe.
But why? Why—in the words of another American senator—is this most prosperous of nations so troubled in spirit, so rent by division, so anxious and uncertain?
The statistics tell us that we are living in a new age of inequality. The divide between the wealthy and working Americans is wide, and growing wider.
You’ve heard the numbers. As to wealth: The top 10% of the country’s earners control 77% of the country’s total wealth. As to wages: Over the last several decades, inflation-adjusted wages for the working class have barely budged, while income for those at the very top has soared.
But the most telling economic divide in the country is between Americans with a high school degree and those who have four-year college degrees or more. A bachelor’s degree now earns a household in this country double the median income of a high school diploma. As of 2016, families with a four-year degree or higher controlled roughly three-quarters of the country’s wealth. That’s a 50% increase since just 1989.
We are witnessing the rise of a new oligarchy of wealth and education. And not surprisingly, the leaders of this country’s government, its press, its corporations and most of its popular culture most all belong to this same class.
But this oligarchy is not sustainable. Not only because it is unjust that the global economy should work for so few, that so many should be shut out of America’s front row, left without a voice.
It is unsustainable because so many Americans are so profoundly discontent, even despairing.
In September, the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee issued a new report on the soaring numbers of what have come to be called deaths of despair. These are deaths from suicide, from alcohol, from drug overdoses. And the numbers are shocking.
Suicides in this country are at their highest level since 1938. Alcohol-related deaths the highest since the start of World War One. And drug overdoses are at the highest level ever recorded.
The numbers are even more startling for the young. The number of 15 to 24 year-olds committing suicide is greater than at any other time since the government began tracking the data over fifty years ago.
For girls and young women, suicides rates have doubled during the 21st century. Doubled.
Taken altogether, nearly 36,000 American millennials died “deaths of despair” in 2017 alone.
There is now a death from drugs or alcohol or suicide every four minutes in this nation.
These numbers, these lives cut short, are tragic. But they represent more than tragedy. They evidence a profound loss afflicting this country, and they summon us to a profound need.
I am talking about the loss of community. And I am talking about the need to rebuild it.
This is a loss that cuts across ages and race and income, that afflicts every sector, every segment of this nation. It is a loss that threatens our common sense of belonging and ultimately, our common liberty.
And it is a loss that is far from coincidental. It is the outcome of how we have been told for years to think about liberty—and politics and the economy; how we’ve been told to think about ourselves.
That’s why it’s no coincidence that the breakdown in community and the rise of oligarchy have happened together. They are both the products of a worldview. A worldview that has now run its course.
Because what Americans need in this century is not less fellowship, but more; not less family, not less belonging, not weaker bonds of love and association, but stronger ones. Forging those bonds anew is one of the urgent callings of our time.
***
Behind the staggering record of deaths of despair is an epidemic of personal loneliness and isolation—driven by the loss of community.
Researchers have been documenting it for years. A major study completed in 2018 found that almost half of respondents said they feel alone sometimes, or always. Forty-three percent said they often feel their relationships are not meaningful. And only half said they have genuine in-person interactions on a daily basis.
The results were, again, far worse among the young. Americans aged 18 to 22, the so-called Generation Z, were the most likely to be lonely, with more than half of respondents in this age group exhibiting multiple indicators of isolation.
The decline of community proves to be key.
Young people are participating less in faith organizations, less at school, have fewer friends. They are even leaving organized sports.
Meanwhile, scholars like Robert Putnam have amply documented the decline in social participation across all age cohorts.
Those Americans who came of age during the twin catastrophes of the Great Depression and World War were passionate members of clubs and associations—from the PTA to the Red Cross to the Rotary Club and bowling leagues. But participation in groups like those has plunged.
And it’s not just civic associations that are suffering decay. Church membership has plummeted, down nearly twenty percent in just as many years.
And then there’s the plight of the family. No community is more consequential than the family, and no perhaps no community is today under greater strain.
Fewer Americans are having children. And only about half of Americans are married now, a steep drop over the last half century. The decline has been especially sharp for the American working class.
Which means that more and more, the great middle of our society is missing the security and also the joy that comes from a lifetime of commitment.
***
Across age groups and regions, across races and income, the decline in community is undeniable. But it is not accidental.
For years we have been told that to be truly free is to be without the constricting ties of family and place, without the demands of faith or tradition.
We’ve been told that liberty means release, separation. And this view has had its effect.
It’s an idea with a long tradition of its own, and a wide circle of influence, back to Immanuel Kant and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and farther back still to a British monk named Pelagius.
But it is only in the last century that it found true staying power in America. William James was an early exponent, and this is how he described his view of the free person:
“In our cognitive, as well as in our active life, we are creative. . . . The world stands[,] really[,] malleable, waiting to receive its final touches from our hands. Like the kingdom of heaven, it suffers human violence willingly. Man engenders truth upon it.”
This is the individual as creator, as self-creator, maker of meaning and author of reality—rather like Prometheus who in the ancient myth created all mankind. So call this view of the human person the Promethean self.
As it took hold in twentieth-century America, the Promethean ideal taught that the individual self exists apart from all social ties and relations. Our family, our religious society, our neighborhood and town—these communities don’t constitute one’s identity, because who one truly is exists separate from all of them.
Instead, the Promethean self creates her own reality, her own truth. She forges her own meaning. And this effort at self-creation is a solitary business. The demands of community too often get in the way.
For the Promethean self, the only time community is truly worthwhile is when it is freely chosen, and then only on the individual’s own terms. For the claims of community must never inhibit the individual’s powers of self-expression. Or so we are told.
This Promethean idea has by now become so thoroughly ingrained in American culture, so ubiquitous in our public life, it’s impossible to escape it.
It is preached in our universities, celebrated in our music, rehearsed in our literature and film. It’s even the stuff of judicial decisions.
Remember this? “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” That’s Justice Anthony Kennedy in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992. I doubt you needed the citation.
And you can see how this idea of the Promethean self, the self-creating, self-sustaining person, suggested a particular kind of politics—a politics centered on the solitary individual.
In this kind of politics, individual choice, and even more, individual achievement are what count. And that makes sense: if our personhood is something we create and not discover, if it is something we assemble entirely for ourselves, then personhood is an achievement; it is something we do.
And place and home don’t matter much. And civic participation is beside the point. And church, synagogue, family—these are fine, but only as groups of individuals, and only if they don’t have too much say in society and don’t control too much of your life.
The Promethean vision has an economic side as well. It gives us an economic policy focused on individual advancement, where advancement means making more money and consuming more stuff. So in popular culture billionaires become heroes, and the everyday working man becomes just some guy who never realized his potential.
Both major parties have embraced some version of this Promethean politics. And both have made it central to their agenda, for decades.
But if you want a life built around home and family; if want to live in the place where you grew up, with the people you love and know; if your ambition is not to start a tech company but to serve on the PTA, well, this politics doesn’t have much to offer you.
And that’s the problem with the Promethean self. It’s an idea that rewards the privileged and entrenches the powerful. And here’s why.
If freedom is about creating your own reality, then those with the greatest access to power will be the most free. And in today’s society, that means those with the most money, the most credentials, with the most influence.
And let’s be honest, a society that prizes the self-creating and the powerful will prize fame and fortune and status, and look down on, or just ignore, those who don’t have them.
And if this sounds like 21st century America, it should. Because our society increasingly rewards credentials and degrees, it lionizes wealth and the size of your social media audience, and it calls these things “merit.”
As if getting them makes you more valuable than anyone else. As if success is a matter of what we can amass.
And where does this leave those without power or money? On their own.
If you’re a worker with a high school degree in the urban core who can’t get a good job, you’re told it’s your fault and you should work harder, get more education, stop being lazy.
If you’re a farmer or working a trade in the middle of the country and can’t support your family on what you bring home, you’re told you should move, that smart people live in cities, and you should have made better life choices.
It’s no wonder so many Americans feel so unappreciated and unheard.
It’s no wonder so many young people feel desperate to get another credential, another good grade, another like on Instagram—so that they can matter.
It’s no wonder so many of our fellow citizens feel so desperately alone.
Because here’s the reality. The Promethean self, splendid in his isolation, needing nothing from others but the space to create, doesn’t exist. The Promethean ambition leaves us lost and unmoored. And the market worship and cultural deconstruction the Promethean vision has inspired have failed this country.
***
The collapse of community in America has been underway for decades now, and as it accelerates, it threatens our common liberty.
Our families and farm cooperatives, our churches and labor unions—they bring us together, they relate us to each other, they tell us what we have in common. And they tell us a story about ourselves, as Americans.
They tell us that what unites us is not race or ethnicity or religious confession. What unites us is the deep conviction that every life matters, that you matter, that every person is uniquely called and uniquely gifted.
They tell us that you don’t have to be rich or famous to be important, that ordinary life—the life of work and marriage and family and worship—that life is valuable, it’s wonderful, it’s what we were meant for, it’s what changes the world.
Our communities of home and worship and labor tell us all this because they draw us into living these convictions together. And this country is built on those convictions. Which means the future of this country depends on rebuilding the communities that make us who we are.
Because in the end, it is community that makes authentic individual life possible.
It’s community that gives individuals strength. It’s community that helps us find moral purpose. It’s community that joins us together to exercise control over our lives.
And so as it turns out, our cherished belief in the liberty of every individual, and the dignity of every person, is rooted in the life we share together.
For in the words of an old theologian, “We do not exist in isolation, [but in] a world of love and hate, blessing and curse, service and destruction . . . where nobody, fundamentally speaking, belongs to himself alone.”
That’s something the Promethean vision has never understood. But then, the Promethean vision never really understood the individual—or love, or liberty. And it is time now to leave Prometheus where he belongs, in the myth of the past.
***
I will leave you with a story from Missouri.
This summer I traveled to some of the most economically distressed areas of my state and talked with people there. I talked with normal people, not politicians—with nurses and barbers and small farmers, with people out of work, with moms and dads.
We’d meet at the local McDonald’s or in coffee shops, sometimes a local diner.
And I’d ask them, one after another, why are you still here? Why do you still live here, in this place—where jobs are too scarce and drug use is too high and after so many have gone?
And what they told me, again and again, was very simple. They said, This is my home. I can’t imagine my life without it.
That’s the power of community.
And to heal the divisions of this country, to end the oligarchy of power and privilege, to halt the epidemic of loneliness and despair, we must rebuild it.
We must forge in this century a new politics of family and neighborhood—a new politics of love and belonging—a new politics of home.
That will mean rethinking old positions and revisiting old orthodoxies. It will mean challenging the old priorities of the political class. But we cannot wait any longer. Our life of liberty, our life together, cannot wait.
So let us strengthen the hands that are feeble and steady the knees that give way.
Let us renew our hope in what might be.
Let us begin.
Thank you and goodnight.

Title: Senator Hawley asks U.N. Ambassador Craft to Consider Options at the U.N to Hold Beijing Accountable for Treaty and Human Rights Violations in Hong Kong
Date: Wednesday, November 20, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft asking her to consider introducing a United Nations resolution condemning China for its apparent human rights violations in Hong Kong and violations of the 1984 Sino–British Joint Declaration.
Senator Hawley writes, “For five months, Beijing and its proxy chief executive in Hong Kong have been attempting to alter the city’s status and restrict its citizens’ freedoms, in apparent violation of Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the 1984 Joint Declaration. The Hong Kong executive has authorized violent force against unarmed demonstrators, has radically restricted the right of citizens peaceably to assemble, has intervened in District Council candidate selection, has illegally banned the use of face masks, and repeatedly laid siege to Hong Kong universities.”
The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration is a U.N.-filed treaty signed by then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang. The treaty guaranteed Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms under the “one country, two systems” formula.
Senator Hawley continues, “To protect the lives of those advocating for their basic liberties, I believe the time has come to consider introducing a United Nations resolution to condemn and hold accountable the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for its apparent treaty violations. In addition, I believe we should consider asking the United Nations’ Committee Against Torture, which reviewed the Chinese government’s treatment of protesters during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, to investigate Beijing and its proxies’ current treatment of protestors in Hong Kong.”
Senator Hawley is an
original cosponsor
of the newly passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and recently
traveled
to Hong Kong to observe the pro-democracy protests. Following his trip to Hong Kong, Senator Hawley
gave
a floor speech in support of the protestors and

Ambassador Kelly Craft
Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations
United States Mission to the United States
799 United Nations Plaza
New York, NY 10017
Dear Ambassador Craft,
I write with regard to the urgent and worsening situation in Hong Kong. On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said “the Chinese Communist Party must honor its promises to the Hong Kong people, who only want the freedoms and liberties that they have been promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a U.N.-filed treaty.”
He is precisely correct. The 1984 Joint Declaration and not the whims of Beijing controls the status of Hong Kong and determines its citizens’ rights. But I share the Secretary’s concern that China may not be abiding by its commitments. For five months, Beijing and its proxy chief executive in Hong Kong have been attempting to alter the city’s status and restrict its citizens’ freedoms, in apparent violation of Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the 1984 Joint Declaration. The Hong Kong executive has authorized violent force against unarmed demonstrators, has radically restricted the right of citizens peaceably to assemble, has intervened in District Council candidate selection, has illegally banned the use of face masks, and repeatedly laid siege to Hong Kong universities.
For its part, Beijing has been clear that it no longer regards the Joint Declaration as binding, despite this instrument’s status in international law. In 2017, the Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed the Joint Declaration “as a historical document, no longer has any practical significance, and it is not at all binding for the central government’s management over Hong Kong.” Beijing’s actions in recent weeks reflects this disregard for its international commitments.
To protect the lives of those advocating for their basic liberties, I believe the time has come to consider introducing a United Nations resolution to condemn and hold accountable the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for its apparent treaty violations. In addition, I believe we should consider asking the United Nations’ Committee Against Torture, which reviewed the Chinese government’s treatment of protesters during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, to investigate Beijing and its proxies’ current treatment of protestors in Hong Kong.
Thank you for your tireless work on behalf of the United States. I look forward to discussing these and other potential measures with you further.
Yours Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Hawley, Coons demand Facebook explain their privacy practices concerning user location data
Date: Tuesday, November 19, 2019

Content:
Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) sent a letter calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to explain Facebook’s privacy practices concerning user location information. In the letter, the Senators express concern that Facebook has misled its users about the company’s collection of location data and how much control users actually have over their privacy settings.
“Location data is among the most sensitive personal information that a user can share with a company. Today, modern smartphones can reveal location data beyond a mere street address,”
the Senators wrote. “We appreciate Facebook’s attempt to proactively inform users about their privacy options. However, we are concerned that Facebook may not in fact be offering users the level of control that the company suggests these settings provide.”
The Senators continue, “If a user has decided to limit Facebook’s access to his or her location, Facebook should respect these privacy choices.”
The letter is copied below and is available
here.
November 19, 2019
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,
We write regarding Facebook’s privacy practices concerning user location information. Recently, Facebook published a blog post in response to new updates to Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating system that are designed to provide users with greater control and information about when their location data is collected by apps on their mobile devices.
Location data is among the most sensitive personal information that a user can share with a company. Today, modern smartphones can reveal location data beyond a mere street address. The technology is sophisticated enough to identify on which floor of a building the device is located. New updates to iOS and Android have been designed to give users greater insight and control over how and when they share their location with apps on their phones. In light of these developments, Facebook published a blog post, titled “Understanding Updates to Your Device’s Location Settings,” in which Facebook describes the different privacy settings that a user can choose to determine when a user shares location information with Facebook. We appreciate Facebook’s attempt to proactively inform users about their privacy options. However, we are concerned that Facebook may not in fact be offering users the level of control that the company suggests these settings provide.
Specifically, in the blog post, Facebook explains that the location settings on a device running the newest versions of iOS and Android allow a user to decide whether to share the user’s “precise” location information with Facebook either (1) all the time, (2) only while using the app, (3) not at all, or (4) if using iOS, only once. Facebook asserts that this means “[y]ou’re in control of who sees your location on Facebook. You can control whether your device shares precise location information with Facebook via Location Services.” However, in the next sentence, the post goes on to say that “[Facebook] may still understand your location using things like check-ins, events and information about your internet connection.” We are concerned that this language and practice undermines users’ actual control of their location data and the blog post’s assurances to that effect.
If a user has decided to limit Facebook’s access to his or her location, Facebook should respect these privacy choices. The language in the blog post, however, indicates that Facebook may continue to collect location data despite user preferences, even if the user is not engaging with the app, and Facebook is simply deducing the user’s location from information about his or her internet connection. Given that most mobile devices are connected to the internet nearly all the time, whether through a cellular network or a Wi-Fi connection, this practice would allow Facebook to collect user location data almost constantly, irrespective of the user’s privacy preferences. Users who have selected a restrictive Location Services option could reasonably be under the misimpression that their selection limits all of Facebook’s efforts to extract location information.
In light of these concerns, we kindly request that you respond to the following questions:
Does Facebook collect any information about a user’s location if the user has turned off or limited Location Services for Facebook? If so, please explain why Facebook collects such information and the process used to collect that data.
Does Facebook collect any information about a user’s location based only on information about a user’s internet connection?
How frequently does Facebook collect location data based on information about a user’s internet connection when a user has turned off or limited Location Services?
What is the difference between the “precise” location information collected when a user has Location Services enabled and the location information collected by Facebook using other data, such as the user’s internet connection, when a user has turned off or limited Location Services? How detailed is the location data that Facebook collects when a user has turned off or limited Location Services?
Does Facebook target advertisements or otherwise monetize the location information it collects when a user has turned off or limited Location Services?
If Facebook does target advertisements based on the location information that it collects when a user has turned off or limited Location Services, is it possible for a user to configure his or her privacy settings such that Facebook never monetizes any location information about that user?
Does Facebook share the location information that it collects when a user has turned off or limited Location Services with third parties?
We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and respectfully request a response by December 12, 2019.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Bill to Address National Security Concerns Raised by Big Tech’s Partnerships with Beijing
Date: Monday, November 18, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
National Security and Personal Data Protection Act
to combat the flow of Americans’ sensitive personal data to China and countries that similarly threaten America’s national security. The introduction of this legislation follows a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism
hearing
chaired by Senator Hawley that explored the tech industry’s ties to China. During the hearing, experts testified that Apple’s
decision
to store iCloud encryption keys in China and TikTok’s
ties
to the Chinese government pose a threat to America’s national security.
Senator Hawley said, “Current law makes it far too easy for hostile foreign governments like China to access Americans’ sensitive data. Chinese companies with vast amounts of personal data on Americans are required by Chinese law to provide that data to Chinese intelligence services. If your child uses TikTok, there’s a chance the Chinese Communist Party knows where they are, what they look like, what their voices sound like, and what they’re watching. That’s a feature TikTok doesn’t advertise.
“And it’s not just Chinese companies that create this risk. Chinese law allows the Communist Party to seize data from American companies operating in China whenever it wants, for whatever reason it wants. This legislation takes crucial steps to stop Americans’ sensitive data from falling into the hands of hostile foreign governments.”
Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is an original cosponsor of the
National Security and Personal Data Protection Act.
Background
China and countries that similarly threaten America’s national security are taking steps to vacuum up our sensitive data:
Today, countries like China can acquire and use personal data in ways that pose a grave threat to America’s national security. As revealed last week, China could use “
images of our servicemen and women
” obtained from sites like TikTok to train its autonomous weapons. U.S. officials currently are assessing TikTok for
national security reasons. China also could build or steal massive profiles on Americans. And China could use aggregate location data from phones to identify bridges or roads to target for sabotage.
Senator Hawley’s bill cuts off the flow of sensitive data to China and countries that similarly threaten America’s national security:
Some American companies agree to give sensitive data to China in exchange for entering the Chinese market. As FBI Director Christopher Wray
testified, Chinese law “compels U.S. companies that are operating in China . . .  to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants.” This law means that when American companies store encryption keys in China, China can read the messages those keys protect.
Senator Hawley’s bill prohibits American companies from transferring user data or encryption keys to China and other countries that similarly threaten America’s national security.
Senator Hawley’s bill prohibits American companies from storing data in China and other countries that similarly threaten America’s national security.
China can obtain data by inserting its own companies into the United States where those companies then collect data on unsuspecting Americans.
For Chinese companies, and companies from other countries that similarly threaten America’s national security, Senator Hawley’s bill:
Prohibits transferring user data or encryption keys to those countries or storing that data in those countries.
Prohibits collecting more data than necessary to provide a service here
Prohibits using collected data for secondary purposes
China and other countries that similarly threaten America’s national security, can purchase American companies that already have collected information on Americans.
Senator Hawley’s bill changes the default rule for mergers of certain companies to block those mergers unless companies obtain pre-approval from CFIUS.

Title: Senator Hawley Suggests China May Be In Violation Of Sino–British Joint Declaration Following Violence At PolyU In Hong Kong
Date: Monday, November 18, 2019

Content:
Following the heightened violence at Polytechnic University in Hong Kong over the weekend, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today suggested that China may be in violation of the 1984 Sino–British Joint Declaration. According to
BBC, “around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.”
The Washington Post
reported that Chinese President Xi Xingping recently urged Hong Kong authorities to take “firmer action” to end the protests.
“#HongKong police trapping hundreds of students inside #PolyUniversity. Won’t let them leave. Apparently want mass arrests. These actions by Beijing-backed govt raise question whether #China is in violation of its 1984 Joint Declaration commitments,”
Senator Hawley
said
on Twitter. “The 1984 Joint Declaration, a duly ratified international treaty, controls the status of #HongKong, not the whim of Beijing.”

Title: Senator Hawley Questions FEMA Administrator Nominee on Missouri Flooding
Date: Thursday, November 14, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley brought the concerns of Missourians impacted by recent historic flooding to Peter Gaynor, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator nominee, in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Hawley’s questions centered around individual assistance eligibility, including the experience of a constituent from Craig, Mo., who was awarded assistance then asked to give the money back.
After the exchange, Senator Hawley said, “I thank you again for the work that FEMA has done in Missouri this past year, but a lot of Missourians still have questions. Of course, a lot of them are still out of their homes. I mean, the flooding has been quite severe in the state. The displacement has been broad and wide. And we look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff to make sure that people get the assistance that they need and that they get the information that they need in order to understand the process and apply and get the assistance.”

Title: Senator Hawley’s Speech on Rethinking America’s Foreign Policy Consensus
Date: Tuesday, November 12, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Hawley delivered a speech on rethinking America’s foreign policy consensus in light of a new era of great power competition at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).
Speech text as prepared for delivery:
My theme today is America’s relationship with the world. And as any student of history knows, that relationship has always been unusual, for we are an unusual nation.
We were the first colony to break from its parent country. We were the first republic of the modern era, and the first republic in history to be governed by a middle class. We were, in short, a revolutionary nation, and all these years later, we live by that revolution still.
And this revolutionary, republican heritage has shaped all our dealings with the world beyond.
For our first century we ventured not abroad in search of monsters to destroy, in the words of John Quincy Adams–in fact, we ventured not abroad much at all.
And even today, the American public is rightly skeptical of open-ended commitments and rightly tired of endless wars. And yet we have rarely been content as a “status quo” power. We have long sought to make the world different–better–safer for our republic, and for our unique way of life.
Now we find ourselves at a new crossroads to an uncertain future. The long twilight struggle that defined American foreign policy for half a century has been over now for half as long. But the End of History has not yet arrived.
Almost thirty years ago, George HW Bush spoke eloquently of a New World Order in the aftermath of the Cold War, a new era of universal liberal values.
Instead, at this hour, we find ourselves embroiled in the longest war in our nation’s history, with no discernible end in sight; frequently at odds with our European allies over matters small and large; divided at home; searching for purpose abroad.
And all the while, the greatest threat to our nation’s security in decades rises in the East in the form of a martial, expansionist China.
And it is my argument to you today that our present foreign policy consensus, the cast of mind and expectations embraced by both major parties for the last twenty years, is not adequate to our time, and it is not right for our future.
This consensus has distracted us from the dangers at hand. It has left us unprepared for the challenges we face. And it has been rejected by the people of this nation.
I’m talking about the consensus I will call “progressive universalism,” the consensus of the New World Order, built around American hegemony and the goal of extending multilateral, rules-based patterns of cooperation to the entire international system.
This consensus anticipated–expected–the steady expansion of progressive ideas, progressive institutions and progressive values, worldwide.
And both of our major political parties embraced this vision, though in different guises.
The American Left emphasized the expansion of multilateral institutions and decision making. They prioritized cooperative bodies like NATO and the United Nations, and stressed international norms and international law as the building blocks of a progressive global order.
Their version of the universalist project saw the United States as indispensable, yes. But it also regarded America unilateral action as something to be avoided, even a danger.
And so left-leaning universalists pushed to integrate the United States more deeply into multilateral bodies and patterns of cooperation. Their aim has been to use American influence to expand a network of norms and rules-based partnerships around the globe.
On this approach, the international system would come to look more like America, and America would become inseparably bound to the international system.
American conservatives, on the other hand, took a somewhat different lesson from the end of the Cold War.
If the Left came to believe that everyone around the world shared the same values, then the Right concluded that everyone could share our values, and should.
For many conservatives, this meant building a world of democracies. And this ambition required in turn a willingness to force changes in hostile regimes, to attempt to democratize whole regions and cultures, while preserving the ability of our government to act on its own.
Conservatives have not fundamentally disagreed with their counterparts on the Left about the ultimate goal of creating a progressive international system. It’s just that they doubted it could be realized through multilateral institutions.
At the end of the day, conservatives didn’t trust anyone to get the job done but America. And for this reason, many conservatives embraced unilateralism and defended the projection of American power.
The differences between Left and Right on how precisely to achieve the universalist vision and how precisely to arrange its features have led to fights that are by now all-too familiar–the debate over multilateral vs. unilateral action, for example, or the proper jurisdiction of international tribunals.
But in the decades since the Cold War, Right and Left together have steadily expanded American commitments, have steadily expanded America’s military footprint, have steadily expanded America’s military involvement in every theater of the globe, in all manner of projects from election monitoring to punitive airstrikes to humanitarian aid.
And it is this consensus of Left and Right together that deserves fresh scrutiny.
More than that, it deserves replacement.
The universal, progressive international order never fully arrived because it was never fully rooted in reality. The unipolar moment at the Cold War’s end was bound to pass, and it has. That moment was an aberration–a triumphant one, of course–but one that offers no roadmap for our foreign policy today.
And most of the world never signed up for the universalist project to begin with: neither Russia nor China agreed to play the part assigned to them.
Meanwhile, the pursuit of the universalist dream left the United States without a clear strategic focus, but with metastasizing commitments–commitments that have been paid for in the dearly earned dollars of the American working class, and in the dearly precious lives of American soldiers.
And let’s not forget, as we honor our veterans, who these soldiers are. They are drawn overwhelmingly from middle- and working-class families, and from families with a history of military service.
The burden of this nation’s long wars has fallen disproportionately on these Americans, and this country cannot continue to ask them to fight on without a clear purpose and without clear priorities.
It is time for a new departure, based on America’s needs in this new century. Because the point of American foreign policy should not be to remake the world, but to keep Americans safe and prosperous.
And those aims are themselves in service to a higher one: to preserve, protect, and defend our unique way of democracy.
We are a republican nation, the first of its kind in history, and it is time we pursued a foreign policy in keeping with our national character and the national interests that character defines. And so we should begin here. With America’s history and America’s character.
We were the first republic in the world founded on the political power of a broad middle class. Though the rights of suffrage were too narrow at our founding, and the rights of citizenship unjustly constricted, still: this country was never governed by an ancestral aristocracy.
This country was founded by the middle of society, by the class of independent workmen and artisans and farmers.
They were the ones who supported the Revolution and sent their sons to die for it. They were the ones who ratified our Constitution. And that Constitution was written with them in mind.
Since our founding, the citizenship class has only expanded (though not without great struggle). And the character of our republic has only become more firmly entrenched.
Our culture, our economy, our whole theory of freedom is premised on the dignity and power of the working man and woman. Ours is a middle-class republic, and to preserve the American nation means to preserve the security and prosperity of the American middle.
This imperative forms the basis of our interests in the world.
We seek an international order where we can practice our unique way of democracy. We seek an international order that will allow our working people to prosper and to maintain their political and economic independence.
And of course we seek an order where the country our people call home is physically safe and physically secure.
We are today a vast continental nation, and our middle class is large, and to enable its prosperity, we manufacture and trade–and not among ourselves only, but with others beyond our borders.
Our middle-class character makes us a commercial nation, and for that reason, a trading nation too.
And so American interests are inseparably bound up with access to other regions of the world on open and equal terms.
American security requires that this nation be free to seek out commercial partners and free to negotiate with those partners for terms favorable to all sides.
But we can only pursue those ends if no region of the world, no key area vital to us, is dominated or controlled by another power.
As Americans, we have long defined political liberty at home as freedom from domination. That is the theory of our Constitution. And that same principle should be the keystone of our foreign policy abroad.
We seek an international system that is free from hegemonic rule, free from suzerainty or control by any one state. We seek an international system where nations can make their own choices, where they can meet on a level field, where they can control their own destinies.
This has long been our ambition in the world.
When this nation was still in its infancy and our borders did not yet span the continent, the Monroe Doctrine announced our intention to prevent any foreign power from exercising dominance in our hemisphere. For this hemisphere was then the region of signal import for our security.
In the First and Second World Wars, our aims were similar. This nation took up arms in places far from home to stop imperial powers from seizing control of Europe and Asia.
And the same logic guided America’s hand through the Cold War. Across administrations, this nation pursued strategies and alliances to stop the Soviets from dominating Europe, and Asia, and ultimately, the globe.
And we succeeded.
Amid this history, of course, America pursued its own experiment with imperialism. Thankfully, the American people rejected that policy, and this nation has rightly renounced imperial ambitions.
Imperial domination violates our principles and it threatens our character. Our aim must be to prevent imperialism, not exercise it; to stop domination, not foster it.
And now we must gird ourselves for a new effort. Because new challenges await, and new dangers rise, and in the world’s most critical of regions: the Indo-Pacific.
It is here, in Asia, that the great security challenges of the twenty-first century are playing out. And it is here that any policy centered on American interests must focus.
This region, this sprawling expanse—with diverse peoples, cultures, and nations–is critical for our trade, for our jobs, and for our welfare. And today, this is the region where the menace of hegemony looms largest.
It is surely evident to everyone here that the once-free and open Indo-Pacific is increasingly less so.
In this critical region, at this critical moment, the People’s Republic of China gathers strength by the day, intervening in the affairs of its neighbors, distorting and manipulating commerce and capital to extract as much as they can, while giving as little as possible in return.
And it’s not just about trade and investment, it’s not only about programs like the Belt and Road Initiative, which seek to bend the wealth of the world to the Chinese Communist Party.
It’s far more than that. China brazenly bullies our allies and partners, aggressively militarizes rocks in the sea, and openly seeks control of the entire region.
We see this in Hong Kong, where promises are broken and violence escalates and basic liberties are restricted, or just brazenly ignored.
We see it in Taiwan, where a free people stand fast against a power bent on erasing its independent identity.
We see it even in our own corporations, like Disney and the NBA, who throw overboard free speech at the first sign of Beijing’s commercial pressure.
And when it comes to commerce, it is true that China buys our products. It is also true that they have given us a degree of market access.
But for years this growing commercial relationship with China has concealed another and inconvenient truth: Our producers and our workers are increasingly at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party. China is building its military and economic power on the backs of our own working class.
This reality has been right in front of us, for those who cared to look. Over three million manufacturing jobs left our shores in the first dozen years of this century due to China–devastating families and gutting communities in places far from Washington.
Our workers have known for years what this city is just now beginning to discover: that the Chinese regime will first take from you and then replace you the second it gets the chance.
China’s drive for regional hegemony is a clear and present danger. At every juncture that China has grown in strength, so too has its government’s willingness to weaponize, and leverage, and project its power.
China’s bid for domination is the greatest security threat to this country in this century. And our foreign policy around the globe must be oriented to this challenge and focused principally on this threat.
Our efforts to counter jihadism, to stem the proliferation of deadly weapons, to curb rogue regimes and to protect valued partners, like Israel–these priorities are essential and remain in America’s interest.
Now we must address them in light of the challenge of China’s bid for mastery in Asia–and beyond.
For this is more than a contest between economic competitors, much more than a rivalry. This is a bid for mastery by an authoritarian and imperial state that we fundamentally cannot trust and that we fundamentally cannot ignore.
And so we must adapt and change to answer this new reality.
That means strengthening our ties with our existing allies and partners in the region, those maritime democracies who have historically kept this region open and free.
It means seeking out new partners like India who share our interests, and even old foes like Vietnam who share our needs.
It means a robust physical presence in key strategic places to sustain regional deterrence. And it means countering malign Chinese influence in other arenas–from Africa to Latin America to our colleges and universities here at home.
And, importantly, it means evaluating our current range of commitments to ensure that this challenge has the attention and resources it needs at this crucial time to succeed.
American might is not limitless, nor are the lives and treasure of the American people. Now we must make hard choices and articulate clear priorities in order to meet the challenge before us.
Let me be clear, our task is not to remake China from within. Rather, it is to deny Beijing’s ability to impose its will without, whether it be upon Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or our allies and partners–or upon us.
We cannot remake every nation in our image. But what we can do is act in a manner that reflects America’s character. By resisting the tyranny of domination by any one state in any one region, we protect our own way of life, we improve the station of our friends, and we support freedom-loving people everywhere.
I tell you today that our foreign policy can change; it must change. It is time we faced facts and addressed the world as it is. And it is time our foreign policy honored this nation’s unique history and its unique character.
Ours must be a foreign policy for the people who built this country; one that honors our workers by protecting their livelihoods; protects our way of life by thwarting hegemons; and respects our service-members by asking them to sacrifice only for a justified purpose and only with a reasonable plan.
Our purpose in the world is informed by our character at home, and by our enduring aspiration to be a free people. Our unique way of democracy is a gift–to us and to the world. Now we must rise to defend it again in our day.
By championing a free and open international system, by striving for a world free from domination and imperialism, we do our part to carry forward our revolutionary inheritance.
Our nation will be safer for it. Our people will be more prosperous for it. And the world will be better because of it.

Title: Senator Hawley Applauds Department of Transportation Investments in Missouri
Date: Thursday, November 07, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) applauded the U.S. Department of Transportation’s announcement that it will invest over $34 million in Missouri infrastructure. Through the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) Grant Program, nearly $21 million will be
invested
in the City of Springfield’s Grant Avenue Parkway Project and nearly $13.5 million will be invested in the North Central Missouri Regional Water Commission in Sullivan County for the East Locust Creek Reservoir Project.
“President Trump and Secretary Chao have once again made Missouri a priority and delivered infrastructure funding for our state. The Grant Avenue Parkway Project will provide the people who live in Springfield a new way to get around and tourists a new way to explore. The East Locust Creek Reservoir project will help to provide water security for an entire region, allowing the community around it to flourish.”
Senator Josh Hawley
In Springfield, the project will reconstruct approximately 3.3 miles of a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian path on Grant Avenue starting in Downtown Springfield, ending at Sunshine Street, including advisory bike lanes, a roundabout, two raised intersections, three protected intersections, a grade-separated crossing at Fassnight Creek, bridge enhancement, utility upgrades, fiber connectivity, additional crossing and signal timing improvements, outdoor incubator, and creek daylighting.
In Sullivan County, the grant will complete a variety of road projects including Highway N relocation below the East Locust Creek Reservoir dam, Highway VV extension to Knob Hill Road, and 4,000 feet of improvements to intersections and turning lanes on Highway 5 for safety. The grant will also be applied to widening and reinforcing gravel roads, many of them currently one lane, around the lake to accommodate the significant increase in traffic in the area.

fired back
at the Mexican Ambassador’s

blaming Americans for the crimes of the cartels and the flow of drugs over the southern border. He stands by his call yesterday
for sanctions
against Mexican officials who will not confront cartels.
In response to my call for sanctions, yesterday the Mexican Ambassador responded w/ letter taking zero responsibility, offering no change in Mexico’s failed policies, & suggesting real problem is Americans’ “drug demand.” As if Americans are responsible for the cartels’ crimes

I remind the government of Mexico that their cartels are murdering American citizens, and trafficking children, and flooding our communities w/ deadly drugs. So yes, I do believe sanctions are warranted for those who refuse to take action

Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called for the U.S. government to impose sanctions on Mexican officials who will not confront cartels and put an end to the violence and drugs pouring over the southern border.
With Mexico, enough is enough. US government should impose sanctions on Mexican officials, including freezing assets, who won’t confront cartels. Cartels are flooding MO w/ meth, trafficking children, & openly slaughtering American citizens. And Mexico looks the other way
In SW Mo last two weeks alone, over 40 drug overdoses & multiple deaths from drugs coming across southern border. Story is the same all over the state. Cartels increasingly call the shots in Mexico, and for our own security, we cannot allow this to continue

Title: FBI Director: China Can Compel Tech Companies Doing Business In Country To Turn Over Any Information China Wants
Date: Tuesday, November 05, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) attended a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing where he questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray on the threat posed by American technology companies storing data in China.
FBI Director Wray told Senator Hawley American companies storing data in China
“is something we’re concerned about in part because. . . Chinese law essentially compels Chinese companies and typically compels U.S. companies that are operating in China to have relationships with different kinds of Chinese companies to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants.”
FBI Director Wray’s comments followed Senator Hawley’s
hearing
on “How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors,” which

Title: Senator Hawley Leads Legislation to Combat Beijing’s Suppression of Hongkongers’ Rights
Date: Thursday, October 31, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with U.S. Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), introduced the Hong Kong Be Water Act to combat Beijing’s steady erosion of Hongkongers’ basic liberties. The Hong Kong Be Water Act condemns the Chinese Communist Party for violations of Hongkongers’ freedoms of speech, assembly, and demonstration — rights that Beijing previously agreed to uphold. It also calls for tough new sanctions against the government officials and others responsible for the violations.
Senator Hawley, who
recently
visited Hong Kong to witness the pro-democracy protests firsthand, said, “During my recent visit to Hong Kong I was alarmed by how quickly the situation has deteriorated. Protesters told me it was important to
‘be water’
— meaning, move quickly and be fluid when confronted by police. Make no mistake about it: Hong Kong is rapidly becoming a police state. We must send a signal to the world that the United States will stand with Hongkongers as they stand up to the Chinese Communist Party.”
Senator Rick Scott said, “During my trip to Hong Kong earlier this month, I met with protesters who are fighting to regain the freedom they were promised by Communist China. I heard horrible stories of police brutality, threats, and intimidation. As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue. I’m proud to sponsor the Hong Kong Be Water Act as we stand with the brave Hong Kongers fighting for freedom and basic human rights that are being suppressed by Communist China.”
The Hong Kong Be Water Act does the following:
Condemns the Government of the People’s Republic of China for violating its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China.
Calls for imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions against the Hong Kong and Chinese government officials – and those operating on behalf of or in cooperation with the same – responsible for suppressing or facilitating the suppression of Hongkongers’ freedoms of speech, association, assembly, procession, and demonstration.
Calls for freezing the assets of Chinese nationals and state-owned enterprises who have contributed to the suppression of Hongkongers’ freedoms of speech, association, assembly, procession, and demonstration.

Title: Senators Hawley, Cortez Masto, Coons, Blunt Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Help Reduce Police Officer Suicides
Date: Thursday, October 31, 2019

Content:
Today Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) introduced a bill to track law enforcement suicides. The Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act requires the FBI to collect voluntary, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Collecting this data will help inform policy solutions so that law enforcement suicides can be prevented.
Senator Hawley said, “Every day law enforcement officers walk into the line of fire to protect our communities. But the trauma they experience can take a heavy toll on those brave men and women who keep us safe. This bill takes positive steps toward getting our men and women in blue the support they deserve in order to heal and recover.”
“America’s law enforcement officers risk their own lives to protect others, and in the process they see some of the most traumatic scenes imaginable,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “These burdens can haunt them and lead to PTSD, depression and other mental health issues that put them at greater risk for suicidal thoughts. They deserve all the support we can give them, and the data this bill will make available is a crucial part of that support. I’ll keep fighting in the United States Senate to make sure that our first responders get the critical assistance they need to do their jobs protecting the public.”
“Tragically, according to the Department of Justice, more police officers have died by suicide recently than were fatally shot in the line of duty,” said Senator Coons. “We must do more to protect the officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe, and that includes providing them with the mental health care they deserve. I’m proud to work with a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act here in the Senate. This bill will provide valuable data that can help inform and target a suicide-prevention initiative within the law enforcement community.”
“Law enforcement officers face stressful and dangerous situations every day,” said Senator Blunt.“That can take a tremendous toll on their mental health and, in too many cases, lead them to take their own lives. The data collected by the FBI will play a vital role in developing policies to help prevent future tragedies. As a mental health advocate and co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I hope my colleagues will join us in this effort to better support the brave men and women who keep our communities safe.”
Earlier this year, Senator Hawley’s
Supporting and Treating Officers In Crisis Act
was signed into law. Senator Hawley’s legislation restored grant funding for law enforcement support services and allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers.
In addition to Senators Hawley, Cortez Masto, Coons, and Blunt, Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also cosponsored the Act. In the House of Representatives, companion legislation was introduced by Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.-5), Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.-17) and Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.-4).
Background
2018 was the third straight year in which police suicides outnumbered line-of-duty deaths. Law enforcement agencies across the country lost at least 167 officers to suicide in 2018. Currently, there is no comprehensive government effort to track suicides and attempted suicides in law enforcement like there is for line-of-duty deaths.
The Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act requires the FBI to open a voluntary data collection program to track suicides and attempted suicides within local, tribal, state and federal law enforcement. Information collected and maintained by the FBI will not include any personally identifiable information.
Participating law enforcement agencies will report information on suicides within their agency to the FBI, including:
Circumstances and events that occurred before each suicide or attempted suicide;
Location of each suicide or attempted suicide;
Demographic information of each law enforcement officer who dies by suicide or attempts suicide;
Occupational category for each law enforcement officer who dies by suicide or attempts suicide; and
Method used in each suicide or attempted suicide.
This bill also directs the FBI Director to submit an annual report on the data to Congress and publish the report on the FBI website.
This program would serve as the principal data collection tool on suicides and attempted suicides within law enforcement across the country. By providing accurate and detailed information on these suicides and attempted suicides, more effective prevention programs could be implemented to save lives.

Title: Missouri, Kansas Congressional Delegation Members Welcome USDA Site Selection Announcement
Date: Thursday, October 31, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Roy Blunt (Mo.), Pat Roberts (Kan.), and Jerry Moran (Kan.), and U.S. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver, II (Mo.), Sam Graves (Mo.), Vicky Hartzler (Mo.), Sharice Davids (Kan.), Ron Estes (Kan.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), and Steve Watkins (Kan.), along with Missouri Governor Mike Parson and Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, welcomed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s announcement that 805 Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Kansas City, Mo., has been selected as the site for the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
Sen. Hawley said, “Moving these agencies to the heartland will help policymakers better collaborate with the ag community they serve. The Kansas City region is home to some of the hardest working farmers and ranchers in the country and is a great place to raise a family. Today’s announcement ensures that Missouri ag will continue to be a leader in feeding the world for years to come.”
“This is a great day for the entire Kansas City region,”
said Sen. Blunt. “I’ve been proud to advocate for the USDA move and finalizing the site selection marks a huge step forward. Bringing these two important ag research agencies closer to the people they serve and the leading research institutions that support their mission is the right move. There are tremendous opportunities and challenges ahead for the U.S. ag industry. In farm states like ours, ERS and NIFA can have a big impact on how farmers and ranchers operate every day and how they’ll move into the future. We’re glad to have them joining the more than 5,000 USDA employees and contractors who already call our area home. I look forward to continuing to work with my congressional colleagues, Secretary Perdue, Governor Parson, Mayor Lucas, and local officials and stakeholders to make this move a success.”
“There is no better place to locate these agencies than the heartland of America. Kansas City, Missouri is a great location for the important work that the researchers at ERS and NIFA do every day—given its proximity to some of our Nation’s leading agricultural research universities and the outstanding economic value and quality of life that the area offers,”
said Rep. Graves. “I’m thrilled that the Trump Administration has chosen to make this move and look forward to the continued success of these agencies which will now work much closer to the people they serve.”
“Kansas City’s selection as the new location for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is exciting news for the region,”
said Sen. Roberts. “I am glad to see USDA recognizing all the rich resources the heartland provides. With the National Bio and Agro-defense (NBAF) facility, the crucial research occurring throughout the KC Animal Health Corridor and Kansas’ school system and job market nearby for the families of the employees, both Kansas and Missouri will reap the benefits of this relocation. There are already several other USDA agencies in the area currently working with stakeholders, and I am committed to ensuring the agricultural research that will occur at this new location will not only benefit the employees, but the agriculture community nationwide.”
“I’ve long advocated that USDA’s ERS and NIFA relocate to the Kansas City metropolitan area, knowing that regardless of what side of the border these facilities would land, it would be a positive development for the regional economy and so many institutions across Kansas and Missouri,”
said Sen. Moran. “I applaud the many entities across Kansas City who have worked to bring these agencies closer to the producers they serve. In addition, I’m committed to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan, bicameral way to secure the resources necessary for USDA to complete this move and to welcome their employees to Kansas City.”
“I am pleased to welcome the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices of Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District. Together these institutions and their employees will bolster the agricultural research sector in the Greater Kansas City region to the benefit of the entire nation. A move like this is never easy on employees or their families; however, as the Congressional Representative from Kansas City, I can assure you that Kansas Citians stand ready to make your transition as seamless as possible. We are ecstatic to have you here, and we look forward to your commendable research continuing in the Show-Me state,”
said Rep. Cleaver.
“There is no better place to locate these agencies than the heartland of America. Kansas City, Missouri is a great location for the important work that the researchers at ERS and NIFA do every day—given its proximity to some of our Nation’s leading agricultural research universities and the outstanding economic value and quality of life that the area offers,”
said Rep. Graves. “I’m thrilled that the Trump Administration has chosen to make this move and look forward to the continued success of these agencies which will now work much closer to the people they serve.”
“I’m thrilled that the Department of Agriculture has chosen Missouri to host the ERS and NIFA. Missouri is once again showing that it is open for business, welcoming these important agencies with a qualified workforce, lower costs of living, and a business climate that allows for families to thrive. I am honored to have been a part of this process and am excited to welcome them to the Heartland,”
Rep. Hartzler said.
“I’m pleased to join the Kansas and Missouri delegations in welcoming these USDA facilities to the Kansas City Metro,”
said Rep. Davids. “Regardless of which side of the state line these facilities fall on, this move benefits our region as a whole, and positions these facilities closer to the people they serve. It also benefits the USDA, as our region has a wealth of institutional knowledge about the critical issues and opportunities facing our agricultural community. I will continue to work with my colleagues, as well as Secretary Perdue and his staff, to ensure a smooth transition for our newest Kansas City residents.”
“I joined my colleagues from Kansas and Missouri in advocating for locating the Agriculture Department’s ERS and NIFA in Kansas City because it is great news for our entire region,”
said Rep. Estes. “In addition to new jobs for our region, this move brings vital agencies within the USDA closer to farmers, ranchers and producers in the heartland and shows a commitment by the Trump administration to hearing from voices beyond the Washington beltway. I congratulate Kansas City’s selection and look forward to supporting this transition in Congress.”
“I want to applaud USDA for all their efforts in bringing NIFA and ERS to the heartland. This announcement is welcome news and will be great for Kansas, Missouri, and the entire country,”
said Rep. Marshall. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to continue to support the relocation in any way that we can.”
“This is an exciting day for the heartland,”
said Rep. Watkins. “The USDA’s ERS and NIFA move to Kansas City area is a win-win. Being located in our nation’s animal health corridor will provide many advantages to the ERS and NIFA. Our region will benefit from the hundreds of high paying employees that will come with this move. I applaud President Trump and his administration and look forward to building on this momentum.  This is only the beginning.”
“We are thrilled that the USDA is moving its ERS and NIFA agencies to the heartland, closer to the hardworking farmers they serve,”
Governor Mike Parson said. “We appreciate the commitment and support of Secretary Perdue, Senator Blunt, and the large Kansas City coalition, including Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, to grow and strengthen the entire Kansas City region. USDA’s investment will benefit both Missouri and Kansas for years to come.”
“I am pleased that after months of bipartisan regional efforts, Kansas City has been selected to house USDA’s ERS and NIFA agencies,”
said Mayor Lucas. “As an essential part of the animal health corridor, and with several high-caliber research universities and institutions nearby, I know that our regional workforce stands ready to assist these agencies in their vital research efforts. I look forward to welcoming these employees to Kansas City.”

Title: Senator Hawley Asks White House and DEA for Additional Resources to Combat Springfield Overdose Crisis
Date: Wednesday, October 30, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), James Carroll, and the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Uttam Dhillon, asking them to investigate the recent spate of drug overdoses and deaths in Springfield, Mo. In the last week alone, the area has seen 40 overdoses and 4 fatalities related to what authorities suspect is fentanyl.
“Local law enforcement in southwest Missouri has undertaken a herculean effort to combat drug trafficking in the area. Their commitment to collaboration in combating drug crime has served Missourians well, but they are currently facing unknown sources of fentanyl in the region, among other challenges with illicit drugs… To help address the opioid crisis, the DEA has recently developed heroin-fentanyl enforcement teams… I am requesting that DEA deploy personnel and investigative resources from these heroin-fentanyl enforcement teams, or from other parts of the agency, to Missouri to investigate this spate of overdoses and deaths. The DEA’s help is especially needed to identify the origin and distribution operation of the drug.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley also requested that the ONDCP restructure the “High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area” regions to allow for more focus in Missouri and surrounding states.
“In addition to DEA’s law-enforcement resources, ONDCP provides critical financial support as the administrating agency of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. The HIDTA region covering Missouri, however, fails to adequately deal with the current drug problem in my state… I urge ONDCP to consider designating a new HIDTA that concentrates on counties in southwest Missouri and other nearby areas affected by major drug trafficking in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This new HIDTA would bring to bear the necessary resources to prevent, investigate, and treat the area’s drug-trafficking challenges.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Hawley
addressed
the city of Springfield’s emergency overdose summit yesterday and is closely

the crisis.

or below.
October 30, 2019
The Honorable James W. Carroll Jr.
Director
Office of National Drug Control Policy
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20201
The Honorable Uttam Dhillon
Acting Administrator
Drug Enforcement Administration
8701 Morrisette Drive
Springfield, VA 22152
I write to express my deep concern over the drug and overdose crisis that is gripping the southwestern region of Missouri, and to ask that your respective agencies act immediately to address this issue in my state.
Southwest Missouri is facing a growing drug epidemic. In Springfield, Missouri,
recent crime statistics
show heroin seizures by law enforcement have surged in the past three years, going from approximately 400 grams seized in 2015 to over 4,000 grams in 2016. Methamphetamine seizures continue to climb in the area, with much of it originating from Mexico. Even more troubling, the area is seeing
increasing amounts of fentanyl. This rise in drug trafficking has predictably and tragically led to an increase in overdoses and deaths in the region. In the
last week alone, Greene County, Missouri, has seen 40 overdoses related to a suspected batch of fentanyl, leading to 4 fatalities so far.
Your agencies lead the federal government’s response to drug trafficking and addiction. The Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) is the chief agency charged with enforcing our nation’s controlled-substance laws. The White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy (“ONDCP”), likewise, is tasked with coordinating and leading our national drug policy.
Both of your agencies have a laudable history of working with Missouri’s state and local partners, who heroically face these challenges day after day to keep people in my state safe. Local law enforcement in southwest Missouri has undertaken a herculean effort to combat drug trafficking in the area. Their commitment to collaboration in combating drug crime has served Missourians well, but they are currently facing unknown sources of fentanyl in the region, among other challenges with illicit drugs.
To help address the opioid crisis, the DEA has
recently developed
heroin-fentanyl enforcement teams. These specialized teams of agents, although based in cities and towns hardest hit by opioids, are not geographically limited, and they bring much-needed assistance to localities affected by these drugs. The DEA’s expertise and manpower complement and reinforce local law enforcement’s efforts.
I am requesting that DEA deploy personnel and investigative resources from these heroin-fentanyl enforcement teams, or from other parts of the agency, to Missouri to investigate this spate of overdoses and deaths. The DEA’s help is especially needed to identify the origin and distribution operation of the drug.
In addition to DEA’s law-enforcement resources, ONDCP provides critical financial support as the administrating agency of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. The HIDTA region covering Missouri, however, fails to adequately deal with the current drug problem in my state. It consists of
72 counties spread across 7 states
—stretching approximately 1,000 miles from northwest North Dakota to southeast Missouri. The Midwest HIDTA is also one of the most populous HIDTAs in the country, encompassing over 15 million people. The structure and size of the Midwest HIDTA hinders the effective coordination and distribution of resources to fight drug trafficking in Missouri and throughout the region.
The Director of ONDCP has the
authority
to designate as HIDTAs areas of the country where drug trafficking and distribution is significant and harming the area. Consistent with those authorities, I urge ONDCP to consider designating a new HIDTA that concentrates on counties in southwest Missouri and other nearby areas affected by major drug trafficking in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This new HIDTA would bring to bear the necessary resources to prevent, investigate, and treat the area’s drug-trafficking challenges.
Both of your agencies are tasked with protecting Americans from the scourge of illegal drugs and addiction. In the face of this worsening drug crisis, it is incumbent on all of government to redouble our efforts and to help Americans in need. Deploying the necessary resources to impacted parts of Missouri should be part of that effort.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Sen. Josh Hawley: China doesn’t deserve respect (or loyalty) from American corporations
Date: Wednesday, October 30, 2019

Content:
See the original op-ed on
Fox News.
Not so long ago, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “In this day and age, you really do have to stand for something.” So much for that.
When Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, ventured a single tweet in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, the NBA swiftly bent the knee to censors in Beijing and reprimanded him. Reprimanded him, let’s be clear, for supporting democracy. Said the NBA, Morey’s comments “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”
What is regrettable is the NBA’s downright eagerness to appease the authoritarian thugs in the Chinese Communist Party in order to make a buck. Or maybe a lot of bucks. The league’s relationship with China accounts for at least 10 percent of its annual revenue—hundreds of millions of dollars every year. That tells you exactly everything you need to know about the NBA’s priorities in the controversy over Hong Kong.
In the days following Morey’s tweet, the league and its players outdid themselves lecturing Morey on his ignorance of the “complicated” issues at play in Hong Kong. LeBron James went so far as to say Morey wasn’t “educated on the situation.”
The truth is, the American people are plenty educated about China. After decades of watching Beijing take our jobs, steal our intellectual property, and build their military on the backs of our middle class, working Americans know what Beijing is about. And every American knows that the right to vote, the right to speak, and the right to worship are basic human liberties.
The people who won’t face the facts are the corporate executives and rich athletes who make money hand over fist in China. It was bad enough when many of these same people shipped our jobs overseas to Chinese markets and hollowed out entire industries in the name of a quick profit.
Back then they assured us American workers would really benefit in the end and — just wait — China would become a democracy. Well, not exactly. Now these experts want to import Chinese censorship and force Beijing speech codes on Americans.
This is a time for choosing. The NBA and other multinational corporations like Apple, which assembles every iPhone and most of its other products in China, can certainly choose to do business in the Chinese market if they like. But they owe it to their American customers, they owe it to this country, to take a stand.
Beijing will continue to use access to its market and other forms of commercial pressure to coerce American companies and their executives to become mouthpieces for its propaganda campaigns. American companies must not go along. It’s time for the NBA and the rest to show a little American independence and tell Beijing where to step off.
If they’re not willing to do that, they shouldn’t be doing business in China. And they don’t deserve the respect or loyalty of Americans.
Sometimes the fate of one city defines the challenge of a generation. Fifty years ago, that city was Berlin. Today, it is Hong Kong. Beijing seeks to dominate the Asia-Pacific region, and eventually, the world — to bend global trade, global markets, and yes, global competitors, to its will. Nothing could be more dangerous to the security of the American people or the prosperity of our middle class.
We are in for a long struggle with China to defend our economy and our people. We’ve surrendered too much ground already. Now is the time to take a stand, by standing with Hong Kong.

Title: Sen. Hawley to Chair Subcommittee Hearing on Tech Companies Putting Consumer Data at Risk in China and Other Hostile Nation-States
Date: Tuesday, October 29, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism,
announced a hearing
entitled “How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors.”
In recent years, problems with data security have become more urgent. Nation-states like China exercise enormous control over local tech companies and sponsor cyberattacks on American firms. Criminals have created more sophisticated cyber operations, leading to data breaches affecting tens of millions of Americans. And big corporations, cooperating with foreign adversaries, are leaving our data vulnerable to malevolent actors.
And as big corporations collect ever-increasing amounts of personal data, they become even more appealing targets for hacking. This hearing will explore the state of cyber security in America, and how the government and private sector are facing this growing threat.
The hearing will explore several topics:
The unique vulnerabilities Americans face in the modern digital landscape.
The growing security concerns created by social media companies and other companies harvesting enormous amounts of user data.
The threat posed when foreign nation-states can easily access data held by private companies; and
The techniques used in cyberattacks and how individuals, private companies, and government officials can guard against those attack.
The hearing will be held on Tuesday, November 5 at 2:30 p.m. ET in Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 226. More information for this hearing including the witness list and a link to a livestream will be announced this week.

Title: Hawley Introduces Legislation to Prevent Foreign Exploitation of Critical U.S. Educational Investments and Innovation
Date: Tuesday, October 29, 2019

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley introduced the
Homeland Security Counterintelligence Threat Reduction Act, legislation to combat concerning national security threats posed by vulnerabilities with sensitive information in higher education institutions. U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced the House companion.
This legislation requires the United States Secretary of Homeland Security to form a task force within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review programs and make recommendations to improve counterintelligence vetting. The bill also requires the Secretary to convene the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Committee (HSAAC) and receive recommendations on the counterintelligence training program.
Additionally, to address counterintelligence concerns at U.S. academic institutions, the
Homeland Security Counterintelligence Threat Reduction Act
would make it mandatory for the Secretary to develop counterintelligence awareness training for certain faculty of colleges and universities, while also requiring enhancements to the Student Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The SEVP modifications include mandatory counterintelligence training for appropriate SEVP certified academic faculty, the identification of sensitive fields of study, and tracking when a foreign student changes their field of study.
“Intelligence officials have warned us that the Chinese Communist Party is using student spies to steal our technology and undermine our national security on college campuses. This bill gives the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to address this growing threat by increasing counterintelligence vetting for student and academic visas.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Representative Walker said, “For too long, the United States has turned a blind eye to growing exploitation by nations like China to use our academic institutions as a method to steal sensitive and valuable information and technologies. We have a duty to protect American intellectual property. This legislation will give the Department of Homeland Security the resources necessary to properly prevent foreign abuse of our educational investments and promote America as a leader in innovation.”
As reported by
Inside Higher Ed, “universities have come under increasing pressure from the FBI, the federal science agencies, the White House and members of Congress to confront what the FBI says are broad efforts by foreign actors, in particular China, to steal the fruits of U.S. government-funded research and other valuable intellectual property.”
Senator Hawley
has previously asked
Missouri universities to reconsider their partnerships with the Confucius Institutes, an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.

Title: Senators Hawley and Blackburn Introduce Legislation to Move Most Federal Agencies Out of D.C.
Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced the
Helping Infrastructure Restore the Economy (HIRE) Act, which moves most federal agencies out of Washington, D.C., and into the heart of economically-distressed regions across the country.
Senator Hawley,
an outspoken supporter
of the USDA’s decision to move two sub-agencies to the Kansas City region, said, “Every year Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars fund federal agencies that are mainly located in the D.C. bubble. That’s a big part of the problem with Washington: they’re too removed from the rest of America. The HIRE Act will move policymakers directly into the communities they serve, creating thousands of jobs for local communities and saving taxpayers billions of dollars along the way.”
The legislation would specifically move the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture to Missouri and the Department of Education to Tennessee.
Senator Blackburn said, “Moving agencies outside of Washington, D.C. both boosts local economies and lowers costs – that’s a winning combination. This legislation would enable Americans across the country to have greater access to good jobs. Tennesseans would greatly benefit from having portions of the Department of Education in the Volunteer State. It is my hope that the HIRE Act will quickly pass the Senate.”
Background
Federal jobs are concentrated disproportionately in Washington, D.C.
Americans spend billions in taxes to pay for federal salaries. But they lack equal access to those jobs. Even though federal jobs are paid for by everybody, those jobs disproportionately are in the D.C. area.
Federal jobs provide economic stability and encourage regional growth. When the FBI moved the Criminal Justice Information Services Center to Clarksburg, WV, the stable stream of revenue from those jobs boosted the local economy and helped it grow.
Moving agencies also is cheaper long term. Lease costs typically are less outside D.C. Relocating agencies in the Department of Agriculture to Kansas City,
according to one report, will save $300 million over 15 years. That report also notes that moving agencies outside D.C. similarly saves costs by decreasing employee attrition. Retaining quality employees is easier when costs of living are low, commute times are short, and federal salaries are high relative to the region.
What Senator Hawley’s bill does
Recently, the Bureau Land Management announced plans to move to Colorado, and two Department of Agriculture agencies are moving to Kansas City. Senator Hawley’s bill would boost this trend by moving most agencies to economically distressed regions so that the benefits of those jobs are more widely distributed.
Moves 90 percent of the positions in 10 executive departments from D.C. to economically distressed regions in the following states
Department
State
Department of Agriculture
Missouri
Department of Commerce
Pennsylvania
Department of Education
Tennessee
Department of Energy
Kentucky
Health and Human Services
Indiana
Housing and Urban Development
Ohio
Department of Interior
New Mexico
Department of Labor
West Virginia
Department of Transportation
Michigan
Veterans Affairs
South Carolina
Requires the federal government to move most non-department agencies to economically distressed regions that have a geographic nexus to the agency
Boosts the economy in distressed areas by moving jobs and infrastructure projects to those areas
Save taxpayers money in the long term by reducing costs

Title: Senator Hawley Delivers Floor Speech in Support of Hong Kong
Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2019

Content:
Today, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley delivered a speech on the Senate floor in support of the people of Hong Kong as they stand up against Beijing’s oppression.
Senator Hawley’s speech comes after he
joined pro-democracy protestors
in the streets of Hong Kong and
called for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign. He has also been critical of
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver,
LeBron James, and
Apple CEO Tim Cook
for kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party.
Remarks as delivered:
As we gather today here in peace and safety in this quiet chamber, we must remember that there is a city half a world away that is struggling to survive. A city that is fighting for human rights and human liberty. A city that is a solitary pinpoint of light on a continent of authoritarianism. A city called Hong Kong. The need there is urgent and the hour there is late and it is time for America to act.
And I know this because I’ve been there. I’ve been there myself. I have seen it, Mr. President. I have been to Hong Kong. I have been to the streets of Hong Kong. I have seen the protesters marching in support of, in defense of their basic human rights. I have seen them demonstrating for their basic human liberties. I have seen them confronting the police with their tactics of brutality and oppression.
And it makes me think, Mr. President, that sometimes in the course of history, the fate of one city defines the challenge of an entire generation. Fifty years ago that city was Berlin. Today that city is Hong Kong, and the situation there is critical because Hong Kong is sliding towards becoming a police state.
Make no mistake, Beijing wants to impose its will on Hong Kong, it wants to silence dissent in Hong Kong. It wants to steamroll Hong Kong, just as it wants to steamroll all of its neighbors in the region, just as it wants to control the region, and just as it wants ultimately to control the entire international system. And we know what’s at stake in this country because we’ve gotten all too familiar with Beijing’s tactics.
We’ve seen what Beijing has tried to do to this country for decades now. They have stolen our jobs. They have stolen our technologies. They have tried to build and are building their military on the backs of our middle class and their aims are expansionist and their aims are domination and their aims are not compatible with the security or the prosperity of this country. And that’s why what is happening in Hong Kong today is so important and the fight there is so significant.
Will a totalitarian China, a totalitarian Beijing, will they be allowed to dominate the city of Hong Kong? To silence it? And then to turn to the region as a whole?
You know, let’s review what’s actually happening there in the streets of Hong Kong. This didn’t start with the people of Hong Kong. This started with Beijing. This started with Beijing and its puppet government, its puppet chief executive in Hong Kong, attempting to revoke the rights of Hongkonger’s–– the rights, by the way, that Beijing promised to the people of that city in 1984 and again in 1997––trying to revoke those rights by bringing in a bill for extradition of Hong Kong citizens and Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in China’s courts where there is no due process, where there are no basic guaranteed liberties, where there is no recourse. This was Beijing’s plan and that would have affected not just the citizens of Hong Kong, but the residents there including over 80,000 Americans who are currently residents in the city. And the people of Hong Kong said no.
Mr. President, on the 12th of July, just a few days after Beijing put forward, this extradition bill, 2 million Hong Kong residents, 2 million took to the streets in peaceful protests. This is a city of seven and a half million, two million on the streets on the 12th of July. And when the Hong Kong government, the Beijing controlled government refused to back down the people of Hong Kong refused to be silenced, and for months now, months on in 20 weeks and more, the people of Hong Kong have been taking to the streets protesting, seeking to vindicate their rights and they’ve been doing it in the face of escalating opposition.
The Hong Kong government, on orders no doubt from Beijing, has sought to deny the protesters permits to gather peacefully. They have sought to deny them the right to cover their faces–– because let’s not forget China is a surveillance state––and the persecution and the retribution against protesters is real and it is constant.
Now they are talking about a potential curfew. They’re shutting down subway stations early so protesters can’t get from one place to another. They’ve used violent tactics to put down the protests, tear gas and beatings and die blasted at protesters, and China continues to escalate. Beijing continues to escalate the situation, turning the screws on Hong Kong, taking away the rights and liberties of the people there. Hong Kong’s demands are not outlandish, Mr. President, they are asking for what they were promised.
They were promised in 1984 by the government of Beijing and a duly ratified international treaty. They were promised the right to assemble, the right peacefully to gather and protest. They were promised the right to vote and to be able to choose their own government. They were promised the right to speak openly, and they were promised the right to worship. And those are the rights that the people of Hong Kong seek to vindicate today. And those are the rights, Mr. President that Beijing is attempting to strip from this city as we stand here today in this chamber.
You know the people of Hong Kong, they have an expression I found. The protesters say that they’re going to be like water. They say, “Be water,” and some have actually referred to this as a water movement. They mean be fluid, be reactive, adjust to the situation, and I just have to say having been there myself having been to the streets, having seen the protesters having met with them and talked with them, their courage and their bravery under pressure is really something to behold. It is an inspiration to me, Mr. President. And I think it should be an inspiration to all of us. And their love of liberty––you never love something more than when it’s threatened––their love of liberty is really extraordinary.
I want to share something that the reverend Chu Yiu-ming said about liberty about democracy. He says it so beautifully. These are his words: “We strive for democracy because democracy strives for freedom and equality and universal love. Political freedom is more than loyalty to a state. Political freedom professes human dignity. Every single person living in a community possesses unique potentials and unique powers capable of making a unique contribution to society.”
That’s extraordinary and he’s exactly right, and Hongkonger’s know it, and that’s what they’re standing for, and that’s what they’re fighting for.
And, Mr. President, the people of Hong Kong deserve our support, and they are depending on our support.
And this is why it is time for this body to act. It is time to take up and pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The time for debate is over. The time for delay has passed.
It is time now to stand with the people of Hong Kong and to send a signal to the world that the United States will stand with freedom-loving peoples, that the United States will stand up to Beijing, that the United States will not permit China to dominate its neighbors and its region and the world. And so it is time for this body to act and to act now. And it is time to do more and that is why I will soon be introducing further measures to help support the people of Hong Kong.
I will be calling for the imposition of global Magnitsky sanctions on individuals and business entities that abet Beijing in its suppression of the freedoms of speech and assembly that rightfully belong to the people of Hong Kong.
And I would just say to those corporations doing business in China, to those multinational corporate entities and organizations like the NBA, that it is time for you to take a stand as well. It is time for you to show a little backbone. It is time for you to show some independence. You may be multinational corporations who do business everywhere in the world, but remember that you are based here in this country. Remember––the NBA should––that they are an American organization. These companies need to remember that they are American entities, and it’s time to show a little American independence.
And so when Beijing tries to use threats of coercion, threats of market access, to get the NBA to censor, to get corporations like Apple to censor, it’s time for these corporations to stand up and say, “We are not going to participate, we are not going to become part of the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda arm.”
It’s time for these companies to remember where their loyalties actually lie.
And I have to say, Mr. President, for too long now, for too many years now, we’ve seen too many of these companies––and these same corporate executives who make money hand over fist in China––we’ve seen them happily send our jobs to China. We’ve seen them happily outsource our work to China, and now they want to import censorship into this country from China. Well, no, thank you. And it’s time that they were open about what it is that they’re doing, and it’s time that they stood up to Beijing and said, “No further.”
I want to say again, Mr. President, that the situation in Hong Kong is urgent and the people of Hong Kong are looking to the United States and to other freedom-loving peoples around the world for support and for strength.
And it is time that we sent them the message––and that we called on our allies to do the same––that we must stand with Hong Kong because our own security and our own prosperity and our own ideals are at stake there.
I think finally of the words of John Quincy, Adams, who I’ll paraphrase, he said, “Wherever the standard of freedom is unfurled, there will be America’s prayers, there will be America’s benedictions, there will be America’s heart.” And today Mr. President, there needs to be America’s Voice.

Title: Senators Introduce Bipartisan Bill To Encourage Competition In Social Media
Date: Tuesday, October 22, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) Mark R. Warner (D-VA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will introduce the
Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, bipartisan legislation that will encourage market-based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring the largest companies to make user data portable – and their services interoperable – with other platforms, and to allow users to designate a trusted third-party service to manage their privacy and account settings, if they so choose.
“Your data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry. This bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another,”
said Sen. Hawley.
“Social media has enormous benefits. But, as we’ve seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides – including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,”
said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. “As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words – by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver’s seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.”
“The exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation. As we learned in the Microsoft antitrust case, interoperability and portability are powerful tools to restrain anti-competitive behaviors and promote innovative new companies. The bipartisan
ACCESS Act
would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights,”
said Sen. Blumenthal.
Online communications platforms have become vital to the economic and social fabric of the nation, but network effects and consumer lock-in have entrenched a select number of companies’ dominance in the digital market and enhanced their control over consumer data. The
ACCESS Act
would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.) to:
Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms.
Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user’s best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.
Previously, Sens. Hawley and Warner have partnered on the
DASHBOARD Act, legislation to require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to disclose how they are monetizing consumer data, as well as the
Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection, modeled after the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) “Do Not Call” list.
“One very real nightmare scenario for the future of the internet is users facing a meaningless choice among a few fully-integrated silos of technology, and the end of independent innovation and creativity. We all need to prevent that from happening. This legislation could help us take a huge step forward towards a better internet future,”
said Chris Riley, Director of Public Policy at the Mozilla Corporation.
“Markets work when consumers have a choice and know what’s going on. The
ACCESS Act
is an important step toward reestablishing this dynamic in the market for tech services. We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return; and if they don’t like the deal, they can take their business elsewhere. By giving consumers the ability to delegate decisions to organizations working on their behalf, the
ACCESS Act
gives consumers some hope that they can understand what they are giving up and getting in the opaque world that the tech firms have created. By mandating portability, it also gives them a realistic option of switching to another provider,”
said Paul Romer, New York University Professor of Economics and Nobel Prize winner in Economics.
“We’re thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers. Built on a solid foundation of privacy and security protections, interoperability enables users to communicate across networks promoting competition among social media platforms. Interoperability ensures that users benefit from increased competition, and it helps new competitors grow by reaching users that are locked-in to their current provider. Senator Warner’s interoperability bill lays out an excellent, practical framework for making interoperability a reality while preserving a role for states to go even further,”
said Charlotte Slaiman, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge.
“All of us at USV believe in decentralized, emergent, market driven innovation. The shared communications infrastructure of the open Internet and a vibrant competitive market triggered the Cambrian explosion of new Web services we all now enjoy. But today, a small number of companies capitalize on their exclusive control over our data – the data we contribute as we interact with their services – to dominate markets, stifling competition and limiting consumer choice. While this is widely understood, most policy makers propose prescriptive regulation that would only further entrench the dominant platforms. The
ACCESS Act
targets the specific market failure – exclusive control over consumer data – that has led to the consolidation of market power on the Web. Ensuring that consumers have access to their data is an elegant way to restore competition without burdensome regulation,”
said Brad Burnham, Partner and Co-Founder at Union Square Ventures.

Title: U.S. Senator Josh Hawley Sends Letter To NBA Commissioner Silver Blasting NBA’s Decision To Side With Chinese Communist Party Over Hong Kong Protestors
Date: Monday, October 07, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver blasting the NBA’s decision to side with the authoritarian Chinese government over protestors in Hong Kong after Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, published a series of tweets in support of the freedom fighters in Hong Kong.
I
n his letter, which was also sent to all 30 NBA team owners, Senator Hawley writes, “Remember that some things are more important than money. Remember your responsibility. You may not think of your League as an American undertaking, but whatever you think, what you say and do represents America to the world. And for an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling.”
Senator Hawley also called on the NBA to cancel all exhibition games in China
“pending a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Hong Kong.”
Read Senator Hawley’s full letter to Commissioner Silver
here
or below.
October 7, 2019
Dear Mr. Silver:
I write today to express my disgust about the position of the National Basketball Association (NBA) with respect to Hong Kong and the freedom of the Chinese people. Doing business in China is one thing, but for the NBA to kowtow to the demands of one of the world’s most brutal regimes in the pursuit of profit is, frankly, revolting. You know better. And the people of this country deserve better.
Not so long ago you said that the NBA is more than just a basketball league. Your comment was, “I think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something.”
1
Let me remind you what the people of Hong Kong are standing for. For five months now, Hong Kong’s citizens have been calling for representative government and preservation of their basic liberties. In response, and at the instruction of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of Hong Kong has engaged in escalating repression. The Government has sought emergency powers and deployed riot police to put down the protests, often violently. Police have employed tear gas, batons, water cannons with dye, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against their own people. Thousands have been hospitalized and arrested. Some may even have paid with their lives.
2
On the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party earlier this month, the Hong Kong police fired live ammunition at a protestor, further escalating the violence.
3
Yet when Daryl Morey, General Manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted in support of the demonstrators, the NBA swiftly condemned not the violence and repression in Hong Kong, but Morey’s show of support for democracy. The League said yesterday that Morey’s comments “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”
4
What is regrettable is the suppression and political violence carried out by the Chinese Communist Party against the good people of Hong Kong.
While the NBA silences pro-democracy voices, the Chinese government seems to have outspoken defenders in the League. Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba and owner of the Brooklyn Nets, yesterday echoed Chinese Communist Party talking points castigating Morey and calling the Hong Kong demonstrations a “separatist movement.” Never mind that the people of Hong Kong are themselves Chinese and are seeking nothing more than basic liberties Beijing has promised them. Tsai went on to say said “the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.”
5
Hurt? Here’s what hurt is: the Chinese Communist Party brutally suppressing free speech, jailing political dissidents, torturing its own people, and interning perhaps millions of religious minorities in concentration camps.
And as the people of Hong Kong risk their lives for freedom, the NBA offers apologies…to the Chinese regime.
That was wrong. Reconsider.
Remember the democratic tradition of this nation in which your organization is headquartered, and where twenty-nine of your member teams are based. Remember that some things are more important than money. Remember your responsibility. You may not think of your League as an American undertaking, but whatever you think, what you say and do represents America to the world. And for an American organization to help the most brutal of regimes silence dissent in pursuit of profit is appalling.
The NBA and its owners should reverse course immediately, apologize to Mr. Morey, and cancel all exhibition games in China pending a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Hong Kong.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Sends Bipartisan Warning to FTC Not to Weaken Children’s Online Privacy Rules
Date: Friday, October 04, 2019

Content:
Today Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) wrote to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging it not to take any steps to weaken existing rules under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The Senators sent their letter following the Commission’s announcement that it will begin an ahead-of-schedule review of the COPPA Rule, as well as its request for public comment on potential updates to current children’s privacy protections.
In their letter, the Senators expressed concern that many of the questions presented in the request for public comments suggest an intention to add exceptions and other rule changes to COPPA that would weaken children’s privacy online. In light of the FTC’s recently announced settlement with YouTube over widespread COPPA violations on the video streaming platform, the Senators express skepticism that the Commission fully appreciates the “threat some tech companies pose to children” and caution the FTC to only pursue changes to existing regulations that “prioritize children’s privacy and well-being.”
“But the FTC’s failure now and in recent years to fully enforce COPPA compliance has us concerned that an update at this time could diminish children and parents’ control of their data or otherwise weaken existing privacy protections. Now is not the time to pull back,” write the Senators in the letter to all five FTC Commissioners.
“As children’s use of technology continues to increase, so too does the appetite by tech giants for children’s personal information. Your agency’s obligation is to put consumers’ interests first and enforce the law.”

Title: Senator Hawley Statement on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China
Date: Tuesday, October 01, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement on the
70th anniversary
of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC):
“Seventy years ago, the Chinese Communist Party seized power from the Chinese people. Since then, its ruthless rule has resulted in the deaths of millions of its own citizens. Concentration camps in Xinjiang and a rush toward digital authoritarianism are the latest examples of the Party’s totalitarian nature, which dates back to the Great Leap Forward and the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
“The Party’s transgressions are not limited to inflicting horrific atrocities against the Chinese people. The Party has stolen American jobs and ideas through trickery and deceit. It regularly engages in economic warfare against Missourians through currency manipulation and tariffs targeting our farmers. The Party is eager to use military force, economic sanctions, and information warfare to impose its influence on its neighbors in the Indo-Pacific and others around the world.
“I hope that Beijing will one day forgo its imperial agenda. Until then, the world must continue to shine a bright light on the Chinese Communist Party’s misdeeds.”
Senator Hawley has led numerous efforts to hold Beijing accountable for its abuses at home and abroad:
Introduced the
China Technology Transfer Control Act of 2019
in order to stop the Chinese military’s theft of sensitive American technologies.
Introduced the
Protect Our Universities Act of 2019, which would limit the Chinese government’s ability to steal sensitive government research from American university research centers.
Sent
letters
to the heads of University of Missouri and Webster University asking them to reconsider their universities’ partnerships with Confucius Institutes, upon the FBI’s testimony that the CCP uses these institutes to spread propaganda, encourage censorship, and restrict academic freedom.
Introduced a
resolution
commemorating the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre, condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) use of force to suppress dissent, and calling for a unified international response to the CCP’s pivot toward digital authoritarianism.
Sent a
letter
to the U.S. Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce calling upon them to levy sanctions against those responsible for the Xinjiang concentration camps.
Introduced the
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which reaffirms America’s intent to hold the PRC responsible if it reneges on its commitment to respect Hong Kong’s autonomy.
Sent a
letter
to Google CEO Sundar Pichai expressing concern regarding Google’s role in the spread of misinformation during pro-democracy protests in Hong-Kong.
Introduced a
resolution
commending the Taiwanese military’s efforts to deter Chinese aggression, especially by adopting and implementing its Overall Defense Concept.
Introduced the
South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act of 2019, which reaffirms America’s desire for the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in these seas, and calls for sanctions against those Chinese persons working to forcibly impose the PRC’s sovereignty over the South and East China Seas.
Sent a
letter, co-signed by Senators Cruz, Rubio, and Blackburn, to the Secretary of State condemning Chinese officials’ active facilitation of the trafficking of North Korean women and children, supporting punitive action against those officials, and encouraging the State Department to prioritize development of a multilateral initiative to combat these atrocities.
Co-sponsored the
Uyghur Humans Right Policy Act of 2019, which articulates concrete measures the U.S. government can take to punish Chinese officials responsible for interning Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang concentration camps, and to protect American citizens and residents from CCP threats here in the U.S. homeland.

Title: ICYMI: Senator Hawley’s Speech on Declining Life Expectancy in Missouri
Date: Friday, September 27, 2019

Content:
Yesterday U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) gave a speech on the Senate floor about a recent Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services
report
on Missourians’ life expectancy. The report shows that life expectancy in Missouri declined last year, continuing a trend that has been going on in the state since 2012.
In his address, Senator Hawley highlighted many of the concerns he heard during his
tour of rural Missouri
in August, including the impacts of a vanishing working class and drug abuse in small towns today. Background from the report and Senator Hawley’s remarks as prepared are included below.
Remarks as prepared:
Earlier this week, the Missouri Dept of Health issued a new report that shows life expectancy actually declined in Missouri last year.
And in fact, has been falling for almost a decade.
Death rates for Missourians who are between 15 and 44 years old fell by almost 30 percent between 2012 and 2018.
The death rate for Missourians who are between 25 and 34 is at its highest rate since the 1950s.
And we know what’s causing it — it’s an epidemic of drug overdoses and suicides, along with a spike in crime our cities.
Here are the facts.
Opioid-related deaths in Missouri have more than doubled in the past decade.
The number of suicides is up by over 50 percent.
And there’s no end in sight.
And it’s not just Missouri.
New data shows deaths from suicide and drug overdoses exploding nationwide. Suicides in this country haven’t been so common since 1938. Alcohol-related deaths haven’t been this high since the 1910s.
And the surge in deaths from drug overdoses is completely unprecedented.
These numbers are tragic, but they are more than that.
They are the signs of a crisis.
We are witnessing the slow-motion collapse of the working class in this country.
All Americans suffer from deaths of despair, but it is working people and working families who have been hit hardest.
And so now the working middle of this nation is fighting to survive.
You don’t have to look far to see it.
I’ve seen it in the small towns of my state, in the places where TV cameras never go, where town squares sit half empty, where businesses stand shuttered, where you can buy fentanyl with the snap of a finger on any street corner.
I’ve seen it in country places where meth is so common they tell me dealers hang bags of drugs from tree branches for their buyers to retrieve, a literal landscape of addiction and despair.
I’ve seen it in the faces of young farmers who put a crop in and pray for rain and pray for sun and pray for fair prices … and then wonder if generations of family farming will end with them.
I’ve heard it from young mothers raising kids alone, and working a job, and trying to go to school at night, and trying to shield their children from the drugs and the pathologies online.
I’ve heard it in the words of young men who graduated high school only to find no jobs, and no place to learn a trade and no hope for anything better.
This is the struggle of working life today.
And in my state, it is a struggle shared by white and black alike, and those of every race.
Because the breakdown of family — and neighborhood — the loss of good work — and the epidemic of addictive drugs — these things know no racial boundaries.
This is a struggle we are in together, a struggle that brings us together, a struggle for the things we love together — for home — and family … and country.
And the future of this country will be defined by how we meet this challenge.
You can see all of this if you’ll look. But this town won’t look.
It’s obsessed with partisan theatrics.
It’s obsessed with money and influence and status.
This town wants to keep its own good times going.
The political elite live in a world where the struggle of working Americans is just a human-interest story to read about along with the gossip page.
But it’s time for this town to take some responsibility.
It is time for the governing class to admit that the policies it has pursued for decades — on trade, on immigration, on finance — have helped drive working people to this crisis.
And it’s time to acknowledge that a crisis for working America is a crisis for all of America.
It’s not enough for wealthy people in Silicon Valley to do well.
And by the way, those people don’t need any more advocates in this city.
It’s working people who need advocates. And it’s working families who need a voice.
Because it’s the working class that built this country and keeps it going now. They are where this country’s strength lies.
And the future of working families and working neighborhoods, will be the future of this country.
That is what we should be debating. This is the urgent need we should be confronting. Because this is what will define our time.
Background on Declining Life Expectancy In Missouri From The Missouri Department Of Health & Senior Services’ New Report
Last year, Missourians’ life expectancy declined from 77.1 to 77.0 years.
The average Missourians’ life expectancy has dropped by nearly a year since its peak in 2012. It has declined from 77.8 to 77.0 years.
Death rates for Missourians in the 15-24 and 25-44 age groups rose by nearly 30 percent from 2012 to 2018.
The death rate for Missourians aged 25-34 is at its highest level since the 1950s.
The decrease in the life expectancy is mainly a reflection of increases in death rates among younger persons for external causes such as drug overdoses, suicides, and homicides.
Opioid-related deaths in Missouri have more than doubled in the past decade, rising from 468 in 2008 to 1,132 in 2018.
In 2017, 61 percent of opioid-related deaths were caused by fentanyl. In 2018, 75 percent of opioid-related deaths were caused by fentanyl.
The number of suicides in Missouri rose by over 50 percent in the past decade from 775 in 2008 to 1230 in 2018.
The number of homicides in Missouri rose by over 30 percent in the past decade from 486 in 2008 to 657 in 2018.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls on FTC to Release Full 2012 Report on Google’s Anticompetitive Business Practices
Date: Tuesday, September 24, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission’s five commissioners asking them to release the agency’s 2012 report on Google’s anticompetitive tactics and abuse of monopoly power. Half of the 2012 report was
inadvertently disclosed
in 2015 and revealed that Google rigged search results to bias its own services over competitors’.
In the letter
Senator Hawley
writes, “I believe the remaining pages likely contain information critical to the public interest because they may reveal that Google has long been deceiving consumers.”
Senator Hawley concludes his letter by noting that 15 U.S.C. § 46(f) gives the FTC authority to publicly release information obtained from investigations when it is in the public interest.
Read the full letter
here
or below:
—
September 24, 2019
The Honorable Joseph J. Simons, Chairman
The Honorable Rohit Chopra, Commissioner
The Honorable Christine Wilson, Commissioner
The Honorable Noah Phillips, Commissioner
The Honorable Rebecca Slaughter, Commissioner
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Simons, Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Chopra, Commissioner Slaughter, and Commissioner Wilson:
I write to encourage the FTC to release the remainder of the 2012 FTC report on its investigation into Google’s anticompetitive business practices.
As you know, the FTC launched an investigation into anticompetitive practices by Google that culminated in a 160-page staff report in 2012. Half of that report was then inadvertently disclosed during an open-records request,
1
but the FTC never released the other half.
I believe the remaining pages likely contain information critical to the public interest because they may reveal that Google has long been deceiving consumers. Google states that it simply returns “the most relevant, useful results.”
2
But two years ago, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for doing the opposite. While maintaining that its algorithm was designed to give users the best results, Google was in fact rigging specific search results to favor the interests of Google’s executives.
3
The now-public parts of the 2012 FTC report reveal that Google was involved in this kind of conduct years earlier. Page 26 and footnote 136 of that report state that Google rigged its algorithm so that if a search ordinarily would return a competitor’s product, the engine would instead return products owned by Google. The report, citing internal Google documents, even says that Google created this code “to bias ourselves.”
This finding establishes that Google was misleading consumers about how its algorithm worked, and the other public parts of the report suggest that the undisclosed pages include other details about how Google systematically deceived consumers. As the report states on page 116, “Google’s conduct has resulted—and will result—in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets.” For example, the report states on pages 28 and 116 that, even as Google told the public it was delivering the most relevant results, it was in fact blacklisting results that it did not like. Google “enter[ed] into exclusive and highly restrictive agreements with web publishers that prevent publishers from displaying competing search results,” and Google “adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.”
The report provides evidence that Google was deceiving consumers before 2012, and the recent fines levied against Google suggest that Google never stopped. The public has a strong interest in knowing the extent of Google’s pattern of deception so that they can make informed decisions about whether to continue using Google or instead switch to a different service that does not rely on deception.
The FTC has the power to “make public” information it has obtained from an investigation if that information is “in the public interest.” 15 U.S.C. § 46(f). Consistent with your statutory obligations, I ask you to release the remainder of the report because the public has an interest in knowing how one of the largest, most powerful companies in the world has engaged in deception.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Leads Bipartisan Resolution Condemning North Korean Labor Camps
Date: Friday, September 13, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) political prison labor camp system. As North Korea appears to indicate interest in resuming talks with the U.S., the resolution,
Senate Res. 303, calls on the DPRK to dismantle their brutal system, noting instances of religious persecution, rape, forced abortions and brutal executions within the camps.
U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas) are original cosponsors of the resolution.
Senator Hawley said, “The crimes against humanity the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are committing are unparalleled in the world today. It has been estimated that more than 400,000 people out of 500,000 imprisoned were killed over a 30-year span. That these conditions exist in the 21st century, after the horrors the world witnessed in the last, is unconscionable. Just as then, we cannot remain silent. We should consider sanctions against those responsible and send a clear message to Pyongyang that the global community is not going to rest until these camps are abolished.”
Senator Cortez Masto said, “The world knows that North Korea abuses its own population by keeping people—many of them innocent of any wrongdoing—in horrific conditions in forced labor camps. The North Korean regime must halt its human rights violations, and the United States and the international community must do all we can to highlight these atrocities and stand up for those who are suffering.”
Senator Gardner said, “North Korea is the world’s leading abuser of human rights, and their vast network of brutal labor camps is barbaric and an affront to humanity. The United States must maintain the maximum pressure campaign against the Kim regime, as called for by the Gardner-Markey Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, until North Korea fully denuclearizes and respects the rights of its people, including completely dismantling these shameful and truly inhumane facilities.”
Senator Van Hollen said, “North Korea’s use of labor camps is a gross abuse of human rights. The existence of these camps is well-documented, and we must continue to shine a light on their cruel and inhumane practices. Speaking out about these issues – and leveraging international pressure – will help us hold North Korea’s feet to the fire.”
Senator Markey said, “The world has rightly been focused on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and other illicit activities, but the United States cannot ignore the atrocious human rights violations occurring in North Korea’s labor camps. If we are to remain true to our values, we must raise awareness about these actions and call for their immediate halt. We must get back to negotiations with North Korea, and must include human rights front and center in that agenda.”
Senator Blackburn said, “North Korea should feel the weight of the entire United States Congress on its shoulders. The human rights abuses committed in labor camps under Kim Jung Un’s watch are unacceptable. I join my colleagues in the Senate in calling on North Korea to immediately cease these horrific practices and to put an end to its gulag system.”
In the resolution, the Senators call upon the international community to join them in demanding the labor camps be dismantled, and create a special tribunal to investigate and remedy North Korea’s crimes against humanity, consider targeted sanctions against those involved in these crimes, and ban the import of goods made by North Korean prison laborers.

Title: Senator Hawley Statement on WOTUS Repeal
Date: Thursday, September 12, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
announcement
that it is repealing the overreaching Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule:
“The Obama-era WOTUS rule was an example of the worst kind of regulatory overreach. It was the product of radical environmentalists seeking to impose their left-wing agenda on America’s heartland—especially on the farmers and ranchers in places like Missouri. Their 2015 rule intended to heap heavy-handed regulations on every puddle of water and drainage ditch on private farm land.
“Farmers take much better care of their own land than the bureaucrats in Washington ever could. As Attorney General of Missouri, I helped lead the effort to fight against the burdensome WOTUS rule. Now as a Senator, I’m proud to support President Trump in rolling it back and restoring the original intent of the Clean Water Act. With this step, we can create a more uniform system for local farmers and communities to move forward.”

Title: Senators Hawley, Cruz, Cramer, and Braun Blast Facebook for Censoring Pro-Life Content
Date: Wednesday, September 11, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.),
sent a letter
to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticizing the social media company’s recent “independent fact check,” false rating, and subsequent censorship of pro-life organization Live Action.
In the letter, the Senators note that Facebook’s “independent fact check” was conducted by abortion rights activists who no reasonable person could consider neutral or objective on the issue of abortion.
The Senators close the letter by asking Facebook to immediately issue a correction, remove any restrictions placed on the pages of Live Action, and submit to a real external audit of its content moderation protocols.
Full text of the letter can be found
here
or below:
—
September 11, 2019
Mr. Mark Zuckerberg
Chief Executive Officer
Facebook
1 Hacker Way
Menlo Park, California 94025
Yet again, Facebook’s pattern of censorship has reared its ugly head.
On August 30, 2019, Facebook notified the pro-life organization Live Action that their website and the page of its Founder and President, Lila Rose, had shared content that had been “fact-checked” and rated “false.” The content in question is two videos produced by Live Action, one featuring Dr. Kendra Kolb, a board-certified neonatologist, the other a speech by Lila Rose, both claiming that abortion is not medically necessary. This is a widely-held view, one shared by the thousands of members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstretricians & Gynecologists, among others. As a result of the “false” rating, Facebook suppressed Live Action’s website and Lila Rose’s Facebook Page, prohibited the organization from advertising and promoting its content, and notified users who had shared the videos that they had shared “false news.”
This so-called “fact-check” came as part of a Facebook initiative to combat false news involving partnerships with groups like The Associated Press, Factcheck.org, PolitiFact, and others. You
claim
that your fact-checkers are “certified” through the “non-partisan” International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Listed first among the IFCN’s “
Code of Principles
” is “A commitment to Nonpartisanship and Fairness” that requires “signatories do not advocate or take policy positions on the issues they fact-check.”
But Facebook’s “independent fact check” of the Live Action videos was performed by two pro-abortion activists with significant ties to abortion-rights advocacy organizations, both of whom are paid to perform abortions. Daniel Grossman sits on the board of NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and has a history of testifying in favor of Planned Parenthood. Robyn Schickler is a Fellow with the pro-abortion advocacy group Physicians for Reproducive Health. That advocacy is on full display in her “fact check” of the Live Action video, in which Schickler gratuitously includes the
statement
: “We should remember that while these medical reasons for abortion are very serious, all reasons for deciding to seek abortion care are valid; no one reason is better than another.”
No reasonable person would describe Grossman or Schickler as neutral or objective when it comes to the issue of abortion, yet Facebook relied on their rating to suppress and censor a pro-life organization with more than 3 million followers. These are clear violations of the IFCN principle and of Facebook’s supposed commitment to non-partisanship.
Your company, like Twitter, Google, Pinterest and so many other major Silicon Valley social media firms, has been repeatedly confronted with evidence of bias against those with conservative viewpoints, especially on the issue of abortion. And in response you have repeatedly insisted that these numerous incidents of discrimination, censorship, and suppression of speech are merely glitches, not evidence of systemic bias.
But if this isn’t bias, what is? The only thing more astonishing than your claim to nonpartisanship is your complete failure to back that claim with proof. Facebook should immediately issue a correction, remove any restrictions placed on the pages of Live Action and Lila Rose, and submit to an external audit. The audit should be real and meaningful, not like last month’s “audit” that was nothing more than a summary of complaints against Facebook and its responses. Facebook must, at minimum, allow an external auditor access to internal Facebook documents and procedures and allow an auditor to question employees and senior officials at the company. I look forward to your response.

Title: President Trump Signs Hawley-Hartzler Bill to Support First Responders
Date: Friday, August 23, 2019

Content:
President Trump has signed the Hawley-Hartzler
National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act
into law. The bill clarifies a misguided policy that prevented federal employees from assisting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) efforts.
The Hawley-Hartzler legislation provides FEMA access to more volunteers, which will allow US&R task forces to get to disaster areas and rescue survivors faster. There are 28 US&R task forces across the country that offer critical assistance disaster zones, including Missouri Task Force 1.
Senator Josh Hawley said,
“This law makes it clear that federal employees who are willing and able to volunteer in US&R disaster relief efforts should be allowed to help. My hope is that it will save lives in Missouri and around the country by allowing more first responders to act when disaster strikes.”
BACKGROUND
Hawley introduced the Senate companion to Rep. Vicky Hartzler’s National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act, which passed the House of Representatives
in April
and the Senate passed
in July.
The 2016
National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act
ensured that non-federal employees participating in Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) task forces are provided certain federal protections from risks such as liability, personal injury, illness, disability, or death. Federal employees participating in US&R task forces do not require these explicit protections, because they are protected elsewhere in U.S. Code due to their full-time employment with the federal government.
Unfortunately, FEMA interpreted the new law to mean that federal workers are prohibited from participating in task forces. This is affecting US&R members across the country who are now prohibited from deploying to save lives.

Title: Senator Josh Hawley Statement on Facebook’s Conservative Bias Audit
Date: Tuesday, August 20, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) released the following statement in response to Facebook’s conservative bias audit:
“Merely asking somebody to listen to conservatives’ concerns isn’t an ‘audit,’ it’s a smokescreen disguised as a solution. Facebook should conduct an actual audit by giving a trusted third party access to its algorithm, its key documents, and its content moderation protocols. Then Facebook should release the results to the public.”

Title: Senators Hawley, Cotton, and Rubio Demand Answers on Google’s Relationship with Huawei
Date: Wednesday, August 07, 2019

Content:
Today Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding answers about the company’s relationship with China’s Huawei. The letter follows
reporting
that Google and Huawei were collaborating on a Huawei-branded smart speaker and are “even closer than previously understood.”
The Senators expressed concern that smart speakers double as listening devices, writing, “These devices can enable untrustworthy companies to listen in on Americans’ conversations. Your attempts three weeks ago to downplay your involvement in China, plus new revelations about your close relationship with Huawei, raise serious questions. . . [I]t is hard to interpret your decision to help Huawei place listening devices into millions of American homes as anything other than putting profits before country.”
The Senators asked Pichai to answer the following questions by August 30:
Why did you partner with Huawei to develop listening devices for use in the United States?
Why did you continue that partnership even after the Department of Justice released an indictment charging that Huawei, as the Washington Post put it, “is determined to succeed by using theft and duplicity”?
What did you learn about national security vulnerabilities with listening devices while working with Huawei, and what steps, if any, did you take to eliminate national security risks from these devices?
What consideration, if any, did you give to the national security risk posed by Huawei before agreeing to work with them on this sensitive project?
The reports about this project state that you “suspended” the project because Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist. Do you plan to resume helping Huawei install listening devices into American homes if the blacklist is lifted?

Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer

Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai:
Three weeks ago, a representative from your company denied, under oath, that Google has been conducting any substantial business in China. Yet recent reports revealed that, until the President placed Huawei on a trade blacklist because of that company’s problematic association with the Chinese Communist Party, you were working closely with Huawei to develop “smart speakers” for use in the United States, revealing that you and Huawei “
were even closer than previously understood.
” These devices can enable untrustworthy companies to listen in on Americans’ conversations. Your attempts three weeks ago to downplay your involvement in China, plus new revelations about your close relationship with Huawei, raise serious questions.
What due diligence did Google perform before agreeing to help Huawei put a listening device into millions of American living rooms? As we have discovered, Huawei poses serious concerns about national security. The oppressive Chinese Communist Party exercises enormous influence over the company. Huawei has even admitted that it hosts a branch of the party within the company itself. To what extent did you consider the national security implications of helping Huawei? And why did your partnership continue for months after the federal government unsealed an indictment that, in the words of the Washington Post, showed that Huawei “
is determined to succeed by using theft and duplicity
”?
We wish we were shocked, but your record around China reveals a string of acts that appear designed to gain favor with the Communist Chinese Party, often at the expense of Americans.
You have accelerated work in China that provides “
a direct benefit to the Chinese military
” even as you refuse to work with the U.S. military.
Until 2010, you operated a search engine in China, Google.cn, that censored results for political purposes. You were happy to censor; you stopped that project only after you were targeted in a hacking attack.
As recently as this year, you were developing a new search engine for China, Project Dragonfly, that was even worse than Google.cn. Unlike the first censorship engine, your new engine would have been even more clandestine about what it censored. Like the Huawei project, you worked on that project secretly. And it appears you scuttled the project only because you faced an
internal backlash
among members of your own company.
Last month, during democratic protests by citizens of Hong Kong, your company “mis”translated the phrase “I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China,” to, “I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China.” That mistranslation parroted the Chinese Communist Party line.
You opened an artificial intelligence center in Beijing and are trying to entrench your relationship with companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party at a time when that regime is using artificial intelligence to oppress racial and religious minorities.
Given this background, it is hard to interpret your decision to help Huawei place listening devices into millions of American homes as anything other than putting profits before country.
This pattern demands an explanation. Kindly respond to this letter with answers to the following questions by August 30.
Why did you partner with Huawei to develop listening devices for use in the United States?
Why did you continue that partnership even after the Department of Justice released an indictment charging that Huawei, as the Washington Post put it, “is determined to succeed by using theft and duplicity”?
What did you learn about national security vulnerabilities with listening devices while working with Huawei, and what steps, if any, did you take to eliminate national security risks from these devices?
What consideration, if any, did you give to the national security risk posed by Huawei before agreeing to work with them on this sensitive project?
The reports about this project state that you “suspended” the project because Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist. Do you plan to resume helping Huawei install listening devices into American homes if the blacklist is lifted?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Senator Josh Hawley

Title: Missouri Lawmakers Hawley, Blunt and Graves Send Letter to FEMA on Behalf of Constituents in Need of Flood Assistance
Date: Thursday, August 01, 2019

Content:
Today Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), along with Congressman Sam Graves (R-Tarkio), sent a letter to FEMA Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor seeking clarification on the agency’s policy for offering Individual Assistance (IA) to constituents dealing with historic flooding. The lawmakers noted that Missourians are frustrated with “FEMA’s confusing and poorly-communicated process for providing Individual Assistance (IA) to those in need.”
In the letter, the lawmakers write, “[C]ritical aspects of FEMA’s IA policy remain undefined. For instance, many constituents are unsure of what constitutes ‘sustained damage.’ Likewise, FEMA representatives have been unable to show us a standardized method for determining when non-FEMA resources (e.g. state disaster assistance or other federal programs) will be insufficient for a given disaster response effort. This matters since IA only becomes available once FEMA has made this determination.”
Full text can be found below.
July 31, 2019
The Honorable Peter T. Gaynor
Acting Administrator
Federal Emergency Management Agency
500 C Street S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20472
Dear Acting Administrator Gaynor:
We are writing in regards to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) response to the massive flooding that has affected Missourians since earlier this year. We are grateful for all FEMA has done to provide Public and Individual Assistance to affected communities. At the same time, many of our constituents are frustrated by FEMA’s confusing and poorly-communicated process for providing Individual Assistance (IA) to those in need.
For many of our constituents, the flooding began on March 11th and has continued ever since. Even though water levels fell by April 17th, these constituents had less than two weeks before the floods started again on April 29th. In that time, many were unable to access their homes, no less rebuild what was lost or damaged. Many constituents have raised concerns that they were deemed ineligible for IA because their flooding started in March – when the Missouri River was at its highest – while the approved incident period for IA only covers disasters that occurred between April 29th and July 5th. To the people living through this flood, it is one continuing flood event – not two separate flood events as has been determined by DR-4435 and DR-4451.
Our latest talks with FEMA indicate the agency has adjusted its policy so that any individual whose home has had “sustained damage” since April 29th may be eligible for IA. However, it is not clear that this policy adjustment has been properly communicated to constituents in need. Moreover, while the agency has opened disaster recovery centers (DRCs) in affected counties, constituents often either do not know about or cannot access those DRCs. Constituents also report that FEMA’s phone representatives are frequently uncooperative.
At the same time, critical aspects of FEMA’s IA policy remain undefined. For instance, many constituents are unsure of what constitutes “sustained damage.” Likewise, FEMA representatives have been unable to show us a standardized method for determining when non-FEMA resources (e.g. state disaster assistance or other federal programs) will be insufficient for a given disaster response effort. This matters since IA only becomes available once FEMA has made this determination.
With these difficulties in mind, we would be grateful for your responses to the following:
What conditions must an individual meet to be eligible for Individual Assistance?
How does FEMA determine when non-FEMA resources can no longer provide adequate assistance to individuals?
Why does FEMA choose to use counties as the unit for determining whether a particular part of Missouri has sustained enough damage to qualify for Individual Assistance? Does this choice disadvantage counties that are less-densely populated?
Will you agree to allow our offices to send caseworkers to disaster recovery centers and/or other FEMA locations in order to help our constituents navigate the Individual Assistance application process?
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
United States Senator

Title: U.S. Senators Josh Hawley and Tammy Baldwin Lead Bipartisan Effort to Restore Competitiveness to U.S. Exports, Boost American Manufacturers and Farmers
Date: Wednesday, July 31, 2019

Content:
Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) are introducing a bipartisan plan to make U.S. exports more competitive, boost American manufacturers and farmers, and reduce our trade deficit. The
Competitive Dollar for Jobs and Prosperity Act
would manage the U.S. dollar exchange rate and bring it into alignment by placing a “market access charge” on foreign purchases of U.S. stocks, bonds and other assets.
According to the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), bringing the U.S. dollar into alignment could add nearly $1 trillion to America’s GDP, create more than five million new U.S. jobs and raise more than $2 trillion in tax revenue over six years.
Senator Hawley said,
“For decades, China and other currency manipulators have waged financial war on U.S. agriculture and manufacturing to devastating effect. This legislation creates a powerful new tool to fight back against foreign currency manipulators, encourage investment in American jobs, and make our exports more competitive around the world. Our farmers deserve a chance to earn a fair profit on their crops. Our factories deserve a level playing field. With this bill, they will get one.”
“For years, foreign actors like China have manipulated their currency, making American exports more expensive and Chinese imports cheaper, forcing our manufacturers and farmers to compete at a disadvantage and blowing up our trade deficit. Today, foreign investors have driven up the American dollar, helping Wall Street profit but holding back stronger economic growth,”
said Senator Baldwin.
“We need reforms that create a competitive American dollar and an even playing field for manufacturers, farmers and workers. This bipartisan fix will increase American exports and boost our manufacturing and farming economy.”
The bipartisan
Competitive Dollar for Jobs and Prosperity Act i
s supported by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (a coalition of manufacturers, organized labor, farmers, and ranchers), National Association of Pipe Fabricators, National Farmers Union, JOA Industries, Meyer Manufacturing, Lapham-Hickey Steel Operations in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and Team Industries, Inc. in Kaukauna, Wisconsin.
Michael Stumo, CEO of the CPA, said,
“This is a big deal, and we congratulate Senators Baldwin and Hawley for their intelligence and vision. A realigned dollar is the most important tool available to spur growth and job creation in the US economy. Their bill takes a major stand for working families and says that we will no longer allow the US dollar to be weaponized against America’s Heartland. It’s time to fundamentally change how we view the dollar.”
“This is a groundbreaking piece of legislation to realign the dollar—and should be considered priority number one for domestic producers,”
said CPA Chair Dan DiMicco.
“Dollar misalignment is the key obstacle to America’s manufacturing competitiveness. The past several decades have shown that large foreign capital inflows from central banks and hedge funds are weaponizing the US dollar against American goods, services, and labor. We congratulate Senators Baldwin and Hawley for their bold leadership in filing this important bill, and we look forward to getting it to the president’s desk.”
“The over-valued U.S. dollar puts American family farmers and ranchers on an uneven playing field with the rest of the world. Despite near record levels of agricultural exports, U.S. farmers and ranchers are now in the sixth year of depressed farm income, and low commodity prices are a big part of the problem. If the U.S. dollar were realigned, our agricultural exports would be more competitive on the world market, driving up prices. The Competitive Dollar for Jobs and Prosperity Act is needed to restore fairness to international trade markets and to provide opportunity for economic prosperity for family farmers and ranchers, and all of rural America,”
said National Farmers Union President Roger Johnson.
“Our manufacturing industry has long been harmed by currency misalignment. Senator Baldwin’s bill is a crucial step towards fixing this issue,”
said Bill Hickey, President of Lapham-Hickey Steel Operations in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
“Our company is a leader in the fabrication of industrial process piping and equipment for the power generation, petroleum, chemical and marine markets. Our business is harmed by the overvalued and noncompetitive dollar that provides an unfair advantage for our import competition. We are pleased to support Senator Baldwin’s bill to realign the US dollar so we can hire more workers and invest more in Wisconsin and across the United States,”
said Tim Monday, Vice President of Technical Operations at Team Industries, Inc. in Kaukauna, Wisconsin.

Title: Hawley-Hartzler Bill to Support First Responders Heads to President’s Desk
Date: Wednesday, July 31, 2019

Content:
Today the United States Senate passed the Hawley-Hartzler
National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act
to support first responders. The bill is a response to a
misguided policy
that currently bars federal employees from assisting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) efforts.
Among the 28 US&R task forces nationwide is Missouri Task Force 1, which has offered assistance everywhere from
tornado relief
in Jefferson City to hurricane relief in
Florida,
Alabama
and
North Carolina. This bill cuts through senseless red tape and provides FEMA access to more volunteers so they can get to disaster areas faster and rescue survivors faster.
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said, “I’m pleased that Congress was able to come together to reverse this misguided decision by FEMA. Ensuring that federal employees can act as first responders in US&R task forces will save lives. Disaster recovery efforts require all hands on deck, and passing this legislation will make that possible in Missouri and across the country.”
Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) said, “This bill will enable more Missouri Task Force 1 Members to be deployed. I am so proud of this dedicated group of volunteers who put their lives on the line in times of disaster to help others. It was imperative we fix this glitch in federal law so all dedicated volunteers can be deployed. I am grateful this bill has moved through the Senate and I look forward to the President signing it into law.”
Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said, “The brave men and women of Urban Search and Rescue are vital to saving lives and protecting property when disaster strikes. This bill will ensure federal employees can deploy with their team members when their called on to keep our communities safe. I’m glad this measure passed the Senate with overwhelming support and is now headed to the president’s desk.”
Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said, “I was proud to co-sponsor the
National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act, and I’m glad my colleagues in the Senate approved it today. During my time as Governor of Florida, my state experienced a number of devastating hurricanes that required quick action on the local, state and federal levels. Search and rescue teams are a critical component of disaster recovery, and this important legislation will give federal employees the ability to provide lifesaving help during times of crisis.”
Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said, “When a community is struck by disaster we need all hands on deck to help with search and rescue operations, which should include federal employees who want to participate in those efforts. I am encouraged that this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to allow federal employees to join a search and rescue task force has cleared the Senate, and I urge the President to sign this bill into law without delay.”
Background
Hawley introduced the Senate companion to Rep. Vicky Hartzler’s
National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act, which passed the House of Representatives
in April
and the Senate passed today.
The 2016
National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act
ensured that non-federal employees participating in Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) task forces are provided certain federal protections from risks such as liability, personal injury, illness, disability, or death. Federal employees participating in US&R task forces do not require these explicit protections, because they are protected elsewhere in U.S. Code due to their full-time employment with the federal government.
Unfortunately, FEMA interpreted the new law to mean that federal workers are prohibited from participating in task forces. This is affecting US&R members across the country who are now prohibited from deploying to save lives.

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces Legislation to Curb Social Media Addiction
Date: Tuesday, July 30, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced legislation to curb addictive and deceptive techniques that tech giants use to exploit users.
The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act
would ban certain features that are designed to be addictive, would require choice parity for consent, and would give users the power to monitor their time spent on social media.
Senator Hawley said, “Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction. Too much of the ‘innovation’ in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.”
Josh Golin, Executive Director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said, “Social media companies deploy a host of tactics designed to manipulate users in ways that undermines their wellbeing. We commend Senator Hawley for introducing legislation that would prohibit some of the most exploitative tactics, including those frequently deployed on children and teens.”
Background
Social media is designed to exploit human psychology and brain physiology.
Social media is sold to us as a way to connect with distant friends and relatives. But tech giants don’t stop there. They design platforms with a bottom-line goal in mind: Capture as much of our attention as possible and immediately sell that attention to advertisers.
Tech giants exploit the science of addiction to put up as many obstacles as possible to keep us on their platforms. Natural stopping points, like the end of a page, naturally prompt users to choose whether to continue reading. But tech giants eliminate these mental opportunities by using structures like infinite scroll for newsfeeds and autoplay for videos.
It’s working. Social media companies capture far more of our attention than they used to. Users now spend on average 2:08:00 a day on social media,
up from 1:22:00 in 2012
—a 56% increase.
What Senator Hawley’s bill does
Bans infinite scroll, autoplay, and other addictive features on social media
Infinite scroll, autoplay, and “achievements” such as “Snapstreak” exploit the science of addiction to make it difficult to leave a social media platform
Exceptions include music playlists, social media predominantly designed to stream music, and “achievement” badges that substantially increase access to new services or functionality
Social media platforms would have to include natural stopping points
Requires choice parity for consent
Companies would no longer be allowed to manipulate people into consenting by making it difficult to decline consent
Companies would have to design “accept” and “decline” boxes using the same formats, fonts, and sizes
Gives the FTC and HHS authority to ban other similar practices
Rules would expire after 3 years unless ratified by Congress
Gives users power to monitor and control their use time on social media
Social media companies must provide an in-app tool that enables users to track the time they spend on social media across all devices and allows users to impose caps on the amount of time they spend

Title: Senator Hawley’s Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Officer Suicide Signed into Law by President Trump
Date: Friday, July 26, 2019

Content:
Last night the White House
announced
that President Trump signed Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bipartisan
Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act
into law. Sen. Hawley’s legislation restores grant funding for law enforcement support services and allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers. The legislation passed with unanimous support in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.
Sen. Hawley said, “I’m thrilled that President Trump signed my bipartisan legislation to support the heroes of law enforcement into law. This legislation will save lives by providing critical aid to officers in crisis.”
Sen. Whitehouse said, “Members of law enforcement are the first to show up in times of danger or tragedy. Police officers help people through the most difficult moments of their lives, and helping officers deal with what they must bear to keep their communities safe is an important duty we owe.”
Co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Tillis (R-N.C.), Gardner (R-Colo.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cotton (R-Ark.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Scott (R-Fla.), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Capito (R- W. Va.), Coons (D-Del.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Grassley (R-Iowa), McSally (R-Ariz.), Cramer (R-N.D.), Collins (R-Maine), and Hassan (D-N.H).
U.S. Representatives Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) introduced companion legislation in the House.
Background
Suicide is the number one cause of death for police officers in the United States, but Congress has failed to fund grant programs that provide support services for police officers and their families. Current grant programs also do not allow for funds to be used for suicide prevention efforts, mental health screenings, or training to identify officers at risk. Senator Hawley’s legislation restores and expands grant funding for these law enforcement support services.
Congress has passed fewer than 35 laws this year. (
Congress.gov, 7/26/19)
The bill has been endorsed by numerous law enforcement and mental health advocacy groups: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, National Sheriffs’ Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, National Fraternal Order of Police, Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department, National District Attorneys Association, and International Association of Chiefs of Police.

Title: Senator Hawley Statement on Proposed Budget Deal
Date: Friday, July 26, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) issued the following statement regarding the proposed budget deal:
The latest budget deal is yet another example of why Congress is broken. I will be voting no.
This budget process, if we can even call it a process, put taxpayers at the mercy of a House Speaker who has no interest in prudent budgeting and who is more concerned with scoring political points than protecting taxpayers or helping working families.
Our system is not supposed to work this way. When the entire federal budget depends on four or five people striking a deal among themselves, something is not right. The budget process has collapsed, and that collapse is breaking Congress.

Title: Following Discussion with FBI Director Wray, Senator Hawley Asks Missouri Universities to Reconsider Their Partnerships with the Chinese Government
Date: Wednesday, July 24, 2019

Content:
In response to yesterday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with FBI Director Chris Wray, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today sent letters to the heads of
University of Missouri
and
Webster University, both of which house Confucius Institutes, expressing his concerns about the universities’ Confucius Institutes. This follows comments during the hearing when Director Wray
told
Senator Hawley that Chinese Confucius Institutes at American universities are a “source of concern” because they allow the Chinese Government to disseminate communist propaganda, encourage censorship, and restrict academic freedom.
In his letters, Senator Hawley writes, “But Confucius Institutes are more than a means of cultural exchange. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party, stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are ‘an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.’ Hanban is governed by the leaders of twelve Chinese ministries, including those handling foreign affairs, state media, and propaganda. Partnering universities sign contracts that prohibit them from ‘tarnishing the reputation’ of Hanban, and Hanban sends teachers and textbooks from China that are designed to promote a positive image of the PRC and suppress any discussion of the ‘three Ts’: Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen Square. These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States.”
Senator Hawley concludes his letters with, “I respectfully and strongly urge you to reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on your campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government. My office stands ready to assist you and to address any questions or concerns.”

Dear Chancellor Cartwright:
I write to express my concern over the University of Missouri’s continued involvement in China’s efforts to spread propaganda, suppress academic freedom, and threaten the national security of the United States.
I am referring to Mizzou’s Confucius Institute. As you know, the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) funds Confucius Institutes through the Ministry of Education’s Office of Chinese Language Council International, known as Hanban colloquially. Hanban has
sponsored
more than 500 Confucius Institutes worldwide—including more than 100 at college campuses across the United States—with an enticing proposal for universities. In exchange for being hosted on campus, the Confucius Institute offers funding for international faculty, language instruction, and cultural-exchange programs.
By your own account, the University of Missouri has taken over $1 million from China’s communist government for these purposes.
But Confucius Institutes are more than a means of cultural exchange. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party,
stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.”
Hanban is governed
by the leaders of twelve Chinese ministries, including those handling foreign affairs, state media, and propaganda. Partnering universities sign contracts that prohibit them from “tarnishing the reputation” of Hanban, and Hanban sends teachers and textbooks from China that are
designed to promote
a positive image of the PRC and
suppress any discussion
of the “three Ts”: Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen Square. These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States.
Confucius Institutes are also a known threat to academic freedom, which is why the American Association of University Professors has
called on
all universities to end these arrangements. As then-Assistant Director of the FBI Counterintelligence Division Bill Priestap
testified
before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, “there have been instances around the world where [Confucius Institutes] have quashed free speech.”
In 2009, for example, North Carolina State University
canceled an event
with the Dalai Lama after Confucius Institute leaders pressured university administrators.
Other examples of suppression and censorship abound.
Most troubling of all, Confucius Institutes pose a danger to our national defense and security. Our nation’s top law enforcement and national security officials have been vocal about the threat of Confucius Institutes and other Chinese initiatives as a conduit for espionage and research theft. In February 2018, FBI Director Christopher Wray
told
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the FBI was investigating Confucius Institutes for potential espionage activity.
Similarly, then-Assistant Director Priestap
observed
that China’s Ministry of State Security will use Chinese students on American college campuses as a means to steal university research and technology.
FBI Director Wray
testified
about the dangers of Confucius Institutes on universities once again this week. When I questioned him about the dangers of Chinese espionage and Confucius Institutes, he stated that “there is a fairly significant pattern of espionage” that is occurring at academic institutions. He went on to reiterate that Confucius Institutes are “part of China’s soft power strategy and influence” and that they “offer a platform to disseminate Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party propaganda, to encourage censorship, to restrict academic freedom, et cetera.” I expect that China’s espionage and influence campaigns in areas like education and technology will continue to be a topic of Senate investigation, including in the Committees on the Judiciary, Armed Services, and Small Business and Entrepreneurship, on which I sit.
Many of your fellow university leaders have concluded that these partnerships are not worth the risk. At least ten colleges and universities
have closed
their Confucius Institutes in the last year, including Texas A&M University, the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Minnesota at Twin Cities, the University of Rhode Island, and North Carolina State University. These are in addition to
earlier closures
at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Chicago.
The University of Missouri should follow their examples.
I respectfully and strongly urge you to reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on your campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government. My office stands ready to assist you and to address any questions or concerns.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley, Blunt, Graves, and Hartzler Announce $81.2 Million Grant for Rocheport Bridge Replacement
Date: Monday, July 22, 2019

Content:
JOINT RELEASE – Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt, and U.S. Representatives Sam Graves and Representative Vicky Hartzler,
announced
that the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) will receive an $81.2 million Infrastructure For Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant from the Department of Transportation (DOT) to replace the Rocheport Bridge.
“Replacing the Rocheport Bridge is a huge victory for our state,” said
Senator Hawley. “This critical infrastructure investment will benefit Missouri residents and businesses by providing safe and reliable passage for the more-than 12 million vehicles that travel across the bridge each year. I am grateful to the administration for prioritizing the critical infrastructure needs of Missouri, and I applaud the Missouri Department of Transportation for their efforts to secure these funds.”
“The Rocheport Bridge is a vital component of our nation’s highway system, carrying millions of people and billions of dollars in freight every year,” said
Senator Blunt. “Replacing the bridge will create a safer, more reliable transportation route for businesses, travelers and local residents. This has been one of the top infrastructure priorities for our state and I appreciate Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s support for getting it done. Location is our greatest competitive advantage in Missouri, and I’ll continue advocating for the federal resources necessary to improve our state’s transportation system and keep our economy growing.”
“Replacing the Rocheport bridge is critical to maintaining one of the busiest transportation corridors in Missouri and the country. As Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I’m pleased to see the INFRA grant program used for this critical project,” said
Representative Graves. “This grant will not only help replace this aging structure, it will also free up much-needed dollars to maintain our roads and bridges around the state – including 76 aging bridges in North Missouri. I applaud Secretary Chao and President Trump for their continued focus on fixing our crumbling infrastructure and congratulate MODOT on working diligently to find a way to replace this bridge.”
“I am thrilled we are receiving the INFRA grant! This award is critical not only for the citizens of Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District and mid-Missouri, but for travelers and truckers across the nation who traverse our great state,” said
Representative Hartzler. “This is a prime example of communities and tax dollars working together to address a critical need. It has been an honor to advocate for this alongside Senator Roy Blunt, the Missouri congressional delegation, Governor Mike Parson, the Missouri legislature, the counties of Boone and Cooper, and the cities of Columbia and Boonville who all stood together making the case for why we need to replace the Rocheport bridge. I am glad the INFRA federal dollars will leverage the local dollars to provide a new bridge we can all be proud connecting the east and west coasts of America.”
The grant will allow MoDOT to make increased investments in additional bridge and road projects throughout the state.

Title: Senator Josh Hawley’s Speech at the National Conservatism Conference
Date: Thursday, July 18, 2019

Content:
This week Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) delivered a speech at the National Conservatism Conference where he discussed the state of American politics today. Senator Hawley also addressed the growing divide between cosmopolitan elites and the rest of America and the need for policies geared toward the great American middle.
—
Speech text as prepared for delivery:
As we gather tonight, we face a nation divided, a political class paralyzed, the old political programs in shambles, the future uncertain. For we have come again to one of the great turning points in our national history, when the fate of our republican government is at issue.
And I, for one, am eager, because it is time we talked once more about first things.
And I, for one, am hopeful, because in the heart of this nation American strength has not failed. It is only waiting to be recognized, to be called upon, to be given voice. And that is our challenge, and that is our duty, in this hour.
Let’s be frank. For too long now, this country has been badly led. We have been governed by a political consensus forged by a political class that has lost touch with what binds us together as Americans. And it has lost sight of the basic requirements of liberty.
Since the days of the city-state, the republican tradition has always viewed self-government as a project bound to a particular place, practiced by citizens loyal to that place and loyal to the way of life they share together.
But the reigning political consensus shows little interest in our shared way of life. Worse than that, it denigrates the common affections and common loves that make our way of life possible. It undermines the kind of labor and economy on which our way of life depends.
For all intents and purposes, it abandons the idea of the republic altogether.
In its place, the leadership class have tried to build a new state in their own image, one that exists cut off from our history, separate from our shared beliefs—beyond borders and beyond belonging.
That project has failed. And what they have left us instead is the curse of faction.
The great divide of our time is not between Trump supporters and Trump opponents, or between suburban voters and rural ones, or between Red America and Blue America.
No, the great divide of our time is between the political agenda of the leadership elite and the great and broad middle of our society. And to answer the discontent of our time, we must end that divide. We must forge a new consensus.
We must recover and renew the dream of the republic.
***
That work begins with a clear assessment of where we stand.
For years the politics of both Left and Right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities.
This class lives in the United States, but they identify as “citizens of the world.” They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community.
And they subscribe to a set of values held by similar elites in other places: things like the importance of global integration and the danger of national loyalties; the priority of social change over tradition, career over community, and achievement and merit and progress.
Call it the cosmopolitan consensus.
On economics, this consensus favors globalization—closer & closer economic union, more immigration, more movement of capital, more trade on whatever terms. The boundaries between America and the rest of the world should fade and eventually vanish.
The goal is to build a global consumer economy, one that will provide an endless supply of cheap goods, most of them made with cheap labor overseas, and funded by American dollars.
But it’s about more than economics. According to the cosmopolitan consensus, globalization is a moral imperative. That’s because our elites distrust patriotism and dislike the common culture left to us by our forbearers.
The nation’s leading academics will gladly say this for the record.
MIT Professor Emeritus Leo Marx has said that the “planet would be a better place to live if more people gave [their] primary allegiance ‘to the community of human beings in the entire world.’”
NYU’s Richard Sennett has denounced what he called “the evil of shared national identity.”
The late Lloyd Rudolph of the University of Chicago said patriotism “excludes difference and speaks the language of hate and violence.”
And then there’s Martha Nussbaum, who wrote that it is wrong and morally dangerous to teach students that they are “above all, citizens of the United States.” Instead, they should be educated for “world citizenship.”
You get the idea. The cosmopolitan elite look down on the common affections that once bound this nation together: things like place and national feeling and religious faith.
They regard our inherited traditions as oppressive and our shared institutions—like family and neighborhood and church—as backwards..
What they offer instead is a progressive agenda of social liberation in tune with the priorities of their wealthy and well-educated counterparts around the world.
And all of this—the economic globalizing, the social liberationism—has worked quite well. For some. For the cosmopolitan class.
Whom it has not served are the people whose labor sustains this nation. Whom it has not helped are the citizens whose sacrifices protect our republic. Whom it has not benefited is the great American middle.
Because in this bargain, foreign competitors get to make the goods, and we just buy them. And then they buy up American companies with the profits.
And yes, in this bargain there are lots of jobs—jobs on Wall Street, or in Hollywood, or in Silicon Valley. Because the truth is, the cosmopolitan economy has made the cosmopolitan class an aristocracy.
At the same time, it has encouraged multinational corporations to move jobs and assets overseas to chase the cheapest wages and pay the lowest taxes.
And it has rewarded these same corporations for then turning around and investing their profits not in American workers, not in American development, but in financial instruments that benefit the cosmopolitan elite.
And where has this left middle America?
With flat wages, with lost jobs, with declining investment and declining opportunity. We don’t make things here anymore—at least, not the kinds of things a normal person without a fancy degree can build with his hands.
And small towns like the one where I grew up in middle Missouri struggle and disappear—and a way of life is lost.
And it’s not just the small towns that struggle.
Just about any American worker without a four-year college degree will have a hard time in the cosmopolitan economy.
Maybe that’s one reason why marriage rates among working class Americans are falling, why birth rates are falling, why life expectancy is falling.
All the while an epidemic of suicide and drug addiction ravages every sector, every age group, every geography of the working class.
Theodore Roosevelt once wrote that “the Roman Republic fell” when “the sturdy Roman plebeian, who lived by his own labor, [and] who voted without reward according to his own convictions” ceased to exist. Our present-day leaders seem determined to repeat the experiment.
Is it any surprise that in the last half century, as our leaders have pursued a program the American middle does not espouse, does not support, and does not benefit from, that public confidence in American government has collapsed?
Is it any wonder that American voters regularly tells pollsters they feel unheard, disempowered and disrespected?
Because who now listens to the American middle? The cosmopolitan agenda has driven both Left and Right.
The Left champions multiculturalism and degrades our common identity. The Right celebrates hyper-globalization and promises that the market will make everything right in the end, eventually … perhaps.
In truth, neither political party has seemed much interested in the American middle for quite a long time. And neither has seemed much interested in the republic the middle sustains.
But the old political platforms have grown stale. And the old political truisms now ring hollow. The American people are demanding something different, and something better.
It’s time we ended the cosmopolitan experiment and recovered the promise of the republic.
***
Let’s start with this. America is not going to become the rest of the world. And the rest of the world is not going to become America.
We are a unique nation with a unique history and a unique purpose in the world.
That history began 2000 years ago, when the proud traditions of the self-governing city-states met the radical claims of a Jewish rabbi, who taught that the call of God comes to every person, and the power of God can work through each, so that every human being has dignity, and standing, and can change the world.
And so the idea of the individual was born.
And our first forbearers brought that radical conviction to these shores and reshaped the republican tradition.
They built a new republic governed not by a select elite, as in the days of old, but by the common man and woman, grounded on the premise that it is the common man and woman who are the noblest of citizens.
And now we must carry their work forward.
We must recognize that a republican nation requires a republican economy, because citizenship is not just a title, it is a way of life. To be a citizen requires independence, it requires the power to participate in your community, to provide for your family, to make your own decisions.
And for those things, our citizens need work. They need jobs. And they need them in the towns and communities where they live, not just in the cities on the coasts.
Because a good job is about more than good money. It’s about being able to make your own life. It’s about being able to build a home. It’s about being able to look your neighbor in the eye and know that you’re their equal. And we need those jobs in America.
And that will require change. Because an economy driven by money changing on Wall Street ultimately benefits those who have the money to start with, and that economy will not support a great nation.
So we need new thinking and new policies to bring the work that makes for citizenship to every person in America willing and able to work.
That means encouraging capital investment in the great American middle, in our workers, not just in financial assets.
That means investing in research and innovation in the heartland of this country, not just in San Francisco and New York.
That means challenging the economic concentration that stifles small producers and family enterprises.
That means new pathways for skills and job training, so Americans can get the tools they need, and the respect they deserve, without the mountain of debt that the higher-education monopoly now imposes—and I have proposed new legislation to this end just today.
It means trade policies that put American workers first, that prioritize them over cheap goods from abroad, that encourage the real production of real things here, and not just arbitrage schemes by the great corporations.
It means an immigration system that rewards and nourishes American labor rather than devaluing it.
And this is only a beginning. Because work must be our priority and work must guide our policy. Economic growth is important, and rising equity prices are well and good, but above all we must get good work for the American people, the kind of work that makes self-government possible.
And we must rebuild our sense of shared purpose and belonging. Because self-government cannot exist without these either.
Our national solidarity has been broken by the globalizing and liberationist policies of the cosmopolitan agenda. Now we must forge it anew.
And so at this moment in our nation’s history, we must work to raise up a generation united in a common love for our distinctive achievements as a people. And that means we must teach our children who we are, without apology.
We must join together to renew the bonds of family life, to honor the claims of kinship and the covenant of marriage. Marriage should be prized in our national policy, not penalized. And from taxes to healthcare, families should get the support and pride of place they deserve.
To rebuild our common purpose, we must protect our communities of faith. Because religious faith has fueled our history and shaped our aspirations and bettered our society.
It is not the role of government to promote Christianity or any religion. But let us be clear: our government should not hinder or diminish religious expression. We need strong religious communities, active in civic life, protecting the vulnerable, defending the weak. Because these communities have helped make us who we are as a people.
In all this, our aim should be clear: to renew the way of life on which our republic depends, to renew the great American middle who make our republic possible, to renew our common venture in freedom as a people.
There is much work to do. There is much need to meet.
But there is much cause for hope.
For in the heart of our society, American strength has not failed. The kind of people who built this nation are here still, waking early and working late, manning the fire department and coaching the Little League, helping the neighbor who just lost a spouse, donating their gas money to a needy family halfway around the world.
They are there, living with the dignity and quiet grace that is the hallmark of the American people. And they are waiting to be summoned.
***
I wonder if you remember the story of Horatius at the bridge. It happened in the early days of the Roman republic, sometime around 500 BC. The Etruscan army, the story goes, marched on Rome to invade, and the Roman defenses were caught off guard.
Eventually the fighting coalesced around a bridge leading across the Tiber into the city. All was chaos. The Roman generals, surprised and unsure, were falling back. The city seemed in great peril.
But a junior officer named Horatius thought otherwise. He saw that if the Roman army could simply hold the bridge long enough for the city to reset its defenses, the republic could be saved. So as the senior officers retreated, he advanced.
Macaulay tells us that as he charged to the front line, Horatius looked over his shoulder to the hills of Rome, and glimpsed his own home there, and knew it was worth defending. And so he took his stand.
We know, with the benefit of history, that the Roman republic was still quite young. Its most glorious day were still ahead. But Horatius didn’t—couldn’t—know that as he took up his position. He knew only that
To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds
For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his gods.
Now we too need courage in our nation’s moment of need. Now we too need bravery born of love for the place we call home. For our republic is yet young, and our greatest days are yet unwritten—if we will stand.
So let us stand together, let us stand for love of country and hearth and home, let us stand with the conviction of Horatius. For —
In yon strait path a thousand [men]
May well be stopped by three:
Now who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?

Title: Senator Hawley Joins Bipartisan Group of Senators in Introducing Bill to Crack Down on Tools Used by Robocallers
Date: Wednesday, July 17, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Martha McSally (R-Arz.) in introducing the Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act of 2019 to aid Americans who are being inundated with robocalls. This bipartisan legislation doubles the penalties for illegal caller-ID “spoofing,” a tactic scammers often use to trick victims into answering their phone calls.
Senator Hawley said, “One of the top complaints I have heard from Missourians is that nonstop robocalls constantly interrupt their daily lives. Even worse, the fraudsters behind these robocalls are harassing and scamming seniors. I fought these invasive robocalls as Missouri’s Attorney General and am proud to join this bipartisan effort to combat them in the United States Senate.”
Senator Hawley also discussed his efforts as Missouri Attorney General to crack down on robocalls during a Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing earlier today.
Background
“Spoofing” of caller-IDs is commonly used by criminal robocallers to mask their true identity. Con artists use this technique to boost their credibility and fool victims by making it appear as though they are calling from the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the local police department, or another legitimate source.
In 2010, Congress passed the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits the use of misleading or inaccurate caller-ID information to intentionally defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The use of this deceptive tactic has exploded since then, however, underscoring the need for stronger deterrent measures.
The Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act would double the penalties for illegal spoofing under existing law, increasing the fine per violation from $10,000 to $20,000 and increasing the maximum fine from $1 million to $2 million. The legislation also extends the statute of limitations for these violations from two years to three years.

Title: Sen. Hawley: Break Up Higher Education Monopoly, Provide More Options for Career Training
Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is introducing two pieces of legislation this week that will expand federal aid for people pursuing vocational education and will put higher education institutions on the hook for students unable to repay student loans.
Senator Hawley
said, “For decades, Americans have been told that you have to go to college to get a good job. But, in more and more places, college costs a fortune. And college degrees are no longer a guarantee of a good job.
“American students and workers need more pathways into the middle class, more opportunities to get good work and build bright futures. And they shouldn’t have to further enrich colleges by taking on a mountain of debt or mortgage their lives in order to get a good-paying job.
“Yet, we have a system that preferences students who want to attend a four-year college over Americans who want to learn a skill. This system protects higher education institutions that have been padding their endowments with taxpayer money while they raise tuition.
“It’s time to break up the higher education monopoly. It’s time to level the playing field and provide more options for career training. We also must hold higher education institutions accountable that take advantage of students who rack up mountains of debt, are unable to find a good job and default on their loans.”
Bill One
The first piece of legislation will make more job-training and certification programs, like employer-based apprenticeships and digital boot camps, eligible to receive Pell Grants through an alternative accreditation process.
This bill instructs the Department of Education to develop a new certification pathway to allow job training, apprenticeship, and certification programs to be eligible to receive Pell Grant dollars. The federal Pell Grant program is this country’s largest non-debt investment in higher education, providing grants to more than 7 million students from low-income families through annual spending of around $30 billion. Allowing students to use their Pell Grant at a greater range of career training programs will reduce reliance on debt and maximize opportunities for students to pursue their dreams.
Some examples include:
Example 1:
ACE Industrial Fittings is booming, but their growth is limited by the challenge of finding and retaining qualified, reliable employees. 10 years ago, ACE partnered with the local technical college to create an employee training program in which new hires spend half their time on the job and half their time developing more advanced skills. ACE pays for the training. They want to grow it, but the cost constrains their ability to do so. Under the Hawley bill, ACE employees could use Pell Grant dollars to pay for the training, allowing ACE to hire more workers at higher wages.
Example 2:
Since 2008, a local theater company has managed a 12-week summer apprenticeship program during which students learn the crafts of stage lighting and sound. Almost all graduates go on to full-time positions as in-house or contract lighting and sound technicians. The apprenticeship program costs $1200. Under current law, the program is ineligible to receive federal financial aid, so students enrolled in the program are prohibited from using their Pell award to cover program costs. Under the Hawley bill, the program could be authorized under the alternative pathway and students could apply their Pell award to the cost of the program.
Example 3:
Debbie is a single mom who works in retail. She always had a knack for computers and design, but dropped out of school before earning her high school diploma. Debbie recently learned about an online academy where she can learn web development, including JavaScript, SQL, APIs and more, at her own pace. However, though she is eligible for Pell Grants, under current law she is not allowed to use the money to cover the $400 registration cost for the online program. But, under the Hawley proposal, Debbie could use her Pell dollars to pursue her dream, in the way that works for her.
Bill Two
The second piece of legislation will require institutions of higher education to have skin in the game when it comes to cost and student outcomes by requiring them to repay a portion of the loan balance of students who are unable to repay their debt.
This bill requires colleges and universities to pay off 50 percent of the balance of student loans accrued while attending their institution for students who default, and forbids them from increasing the cost of attendance to offset their liability.

Title: Senator Hawley Grills Google Exec During Judiciary Committee Hearing
Date: Tuesday, July 16, 2019

Content:
Today during a
hearing
in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) grilled Google’s vice president for government affairs and public policy, Karan Bhatia, on a range of subjects including Google’s work on censored search engines in China, YouTube’s curation of content for pedophiles, and whether Google would commit to an independent third-party audit of its content moderation practices.
Sen. Hawley said, “Trust and confidence in your company has run out, and I think it’s time for some accountability.”
A couple notable moments:
Bhatia told Sen. Hawley that Google’s censored search engine, Project Dragonfly, has been “terminated.” The exchange can be viewed
here
and a transcript can be found below.
Hawley:
Since you mentioned Project Dragonfly, why don’t you tell us about that, is it active right now?
Bhatia:
It’s not Senator.
Hawley:
You’re able to say that for the record? It’s not active, you’ve abandoned Project Dragonfly?
Bhatia:
Yes, we have terminated that.
Bhatia seemingly contradicted himself. First, he told Sen. Hawley Google barely does any business in China, then he said Google exited the country in 2010 when it closed shut down Google.cn. The exchange can be viewed
here
and a transcript can be found below.
Hawley:
What do you think about General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his comment at the Atlantic Council a few months ago that typically, I’m quoting him: “Typically if a company does business in China, they’re automatically going to be required to have a cell of the Communist Party in that company, and that is going to lead to the intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military.” Do you think he’s right about that? Wrong about that?
Bhatia:
Senator, we do, as I mentioned before, barely any business in China, so I don’t have really the basis…
Hawley:
But you have done in the past, and you have tried to.
Bhatia:
2010, we exited the country.

Title: Senators Hawley and Cruz Ask FTC to Investigate Tech Censorship Practices, Make Findings Public
Date: Monday, July 15, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to use its section 6(b) authority to investigate how major tech companies curate content due to the “enormous influence” these companies hold over speech and the “alarming and endless” possibilities for abuse.
In the letter to all five FTC Commissioners, the Senators write, “The FTC does not need a law-enforcement purpose to conduct a section 6(b) study. We encourage the FTC to open a section 6(b) investigation into how big tech companies curate content. The FTC should then ‘make public’ any information it discovers that is ‘in the public interest.'”
Senators Hawley and Cruz also note the unique power big tech companies have over the content Americans see, writing, “Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech. The vast majority of internet traffic flows through just a handful of these companies. They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent. Never before in this country have so few people controlled so much speech.”

The Honorable Joseph J. Simons, Chairman
The Honorable Rohit Chopra, Commissioner
The Honorable Christine Wilson, Commissioner
The Honorable Noah Phillips, Commissioner
The Honorable Rebecca Slaughter, Commissioner
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Simons, Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Chopra, Commissioner Slaughter, and Commissioner Wilson:
We write to encourage the FTC to exercise its section 6(b) authority to investigate how major tech companies curate content. As you know, this section authorizes the FTC to force companies to provide the information necessary to understand fully their “conduct” and “practices.” 15 U.S.C. § 46(b).
Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech. The vast majority of internet traffic flows through just a handful of these companies. They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent. Never before in this country have so few people controlled so much speech.
The possibilities for abuse in this area are alarming and endless. Apart from more salient examples of censorship like account suspensions, nobody knows who or what these companies censor or amplify. Most content curation occurs in ways impossible for outsiders to detect. Some content is downgraded: the content appears in fewer recommendations, lower on search pages, and less often in news feeds. Other content is amplified through the same means. By controlling the content we see, these companies are powerful enough to—at the very least—sway elections. And we’re told we have to be satisfied simply with trusting them not to abuse this immense power.
Companies that are this big and that have the potential to threaten democracy this much should not be allowed to curate content entirely without any transparency. These companies can greatly influence democratic outcomes, yet they have no accountability to voters. They are not even accountable to their own customers because nobody knows how these companies curate content.
Congress empowered the FTC to conduct investigations in precisely these circumstances where more information is needed to determine full compliance with the law. We encourage the FTC to open a section 6(b) investigation into how big tech companies curate content. The FTC should then “make public” any information it discovers that is “in the public interest.” 15 U.S.C. § 46(f).
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator (R-Mo.)
Ted Cruz
U.S. Senator (R-Texas)

Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with Vice President Mike Pence, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and officials from the Department of Homeland Security, toured the southern border. The group later addressed the crisis at the border during a press conference in McAllen, Texas.
Senator Hawley said, “The state of Missouri does not share a border with Mexico, but in this present crisis we are a border state. We are a border state because of the drugs that are pouring across this border and flooding into the towns and streets and homes of the people of Missouri. We are a border state because of the families, whose lives are destroyed by those drugs, whose lives are destroyed by crime. We are a border state because of the human smuggling that is becoming an epidemic across this border, it is flooding into every state of the union.”
Since taking office in January, Senator Hawley has worked on several pieces immigration legislation, including cosponsoring the
RAISE Act, the
Accountability for Care of Unaccompanied Alien Children Act, and the

“What happens at the border has a tremendous impact on communities in Missouri,” Senator Hawley said. “The nonstop flow of drugs and human trafficking coming into this country is a crisis, plain and simple. I want to learn more about the challenges our agents face, the problems these local communities are dealing with, and how we can figure out a path forward. We are facing a
surge at the southern border

Title: President Trump Praises Sen. Hawley’s “Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act”
Date: Thursday, July 11, 2019

Content:
Today at the White House Social Media Summit, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) discussed his
Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act
and President Donald Trump praised the legislation.
Senator Hawley said, “And that’s why we need to step up now, and I think we need to say to them, here’s the deal – Google, Facebook Twitter, they’ve gotten these special deals from government. They’ve gotten a special giveaway from government. They’re treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here’s the bargain: they have to quit discriminating against conservatives. You agree with that? No more. No more discrimination. It’s that simple. That’s all were asking for.”
President Trump said, “And you know what Josh is doing right now? He’s doing some very important legislation, because we have to do something about what’s happening.”
President Trump’s praise for Sen. Hawley’s legislation comes on the heels of

Title: Senator Hawley’s Bill to Prevent Officer Suicide Passes House, Moves to President’s Desk
Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2019

Content:
Today the United States House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bipartisan
Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act, which restores grant funding for law enforcement support services and allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) is Sen. Hawley’s lead cosponsor on the legislation in the Senate, where it
passed unanimously
in May.
Sen. Hawley said, “I’m thrilled that Congress passed my bipartisan legislation to support our men and women in law enforcement. These heroes show up every day to protect and serve our communities, so it’s important that we show up for them.”
Sen. Whitehouse said, “Members of law enforcement routinely encounter danger and tragedy on the job. Our bipartisan STOIC Act is now well on its way to becoming law and helping police officers deal strongly with what they must bear to keep their communities safe.”
Co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Tillis (R-N.C.), Gardner (R-Colo.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cotton (R-Ark.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Scott (R-Fla.), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Capito (R- W. Va.), Coons (D-Del.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Grassley (R-Iowa), McSally (R-Ariz.), Cramer (R-N.D.), Collins (R-Maine), and Hassan (D-N.H).
U.S. Representatives Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) introduced companion legislation in the House. The bill is now headed to President Trump’s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law in the coming days.
Background
Suicide is the number one cause of death for police officers in the United States, but Congress has failed to fund grant programs that provide support services for police officers and their families. Current grant programs also do not allow for funds to be used for suicide prevention efforts, mental health screenings, or training to identify officers at risk. Senator Hawley’s legislation restores and expands grant funding for these law enforcement support services.
Congress has passed fewer than 35 laws this year.
(
Congress.gov, 7/10/19)
The bill has been endorsed by numerous law enforcement and mental health advocacy groups: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, National Sheriffs’ Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, National Fraternal Order of Police, Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department, National District Attorneys Association, and International Association of Chiefs of Police.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls Out YouTube for Refusing to Stop Recommending Videos of Children to Pedophiles
Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2019

Content:
Today in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing called
Protecting Innocence in a Digital World, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called out YouTube for prioritizing ad revenue over children’s safety. Senator Hawley discussed the
legislation
he introduced to ban video-hosting websites like YouTube from automatically recommending videos of children. Hawley’s legislation followed
The New York Times
reporting that YouTube’s algorithm automatically curates home videos of children for pedophiles.
“This report was sickening, but I think what was even more sickening was YouTube’s refusal to do anything about it,”
Senator Hawley
said. “YouTube admitted that they could do something about it, they could stop auto-referring these videos of minors to pedophiles, but they chose not to do so. Why not? Because their model is that 70 percent of their traffic comes from these auto-recommended videos. In other words, there is ad revenue that would be lost if they actually took some enforcement steps here, took some steps to stop this exploitation of children.”

Title: Senators Hawley and Blunt Commend President Trump’s Approval of Disaster Declaration for Missouri
Date: Tuesday, July 09, 2019

Content:
Today, Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt commended the Trump administration for granting a federal disaster declaration for the State of Missouri. The declaration approved the release of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance to 20 counties impacted by severe weather that began April 29, 2019.
“This is an important step forward for Missouri families who suffered devastating losses during the severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding this year,” said Hawley. “While there is still plenty more work to be done, this declaration will give more communities the resources they need to get back on their feet.”
“Today’s announcement is an important step toward making sure communities hit by historic flooding and damaging tornadoes have the support they need to rebuild,” said Blunt. “There has been extensive damage to local infrastructure, businesses, and personal property. FEMA’s Individual Assistance program will provide these 20 counties with grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and uninsured property loss to help individuals rebuild Missouri communities. I’ll continue working with the administration, Governor Parson, and local officials to ensure all impacted areas have the resources they need to recover.”
The following counties are eligible for federal aid under the disaster declaration announced today: Andrew, Atchison, Boone, Buchanan, Carroll, Chariton, Cole, Greene, Holt, Jackson, Jasper, Lafayette, Lincoln, Livingston, Miller, Osage, Pike, Platte, Pulaski, and St. Charles.
The entire Missouri congressional delegation, including Blunt and Hawley, recently sent a
letter
to President Trump supporting the Parson administration’s request for a disaster declaration for 41 Missouri counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is reviewing eligibility for the remaining 21 counties not covered by today’s declaration.
Missouri previously received a disaster declaration for severe weather that ended on April 19, 2019. Today’s declaration covers five counties that were excluded from the previous declaration.

Today, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Roy Blunt (Mo.) commended Senate passage of their legislation permanently designating May 1 as Silver Star Service Banner Day. The measure honors our nation’s wounded and ill service members and veterans, and their families. The amendment was included in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the Senate yesterday.
“What truly makes America great are the brave men, women and their families who answered the call to serve and allow us to enjoy the freedoms we have today,” said
Hawley. “While we can never thank them enough, we can celebrate their selflessness and permanently honor those wounded and ill service members and veterans across the country every May 1st for Silver Star Service Banner Day.”
“There are thousands of men and women who carry wounds from their service to our nation, and their sacrifices should never be forgotten,” said
Blunt. “This effort to honor their service wouldn’t have been possible without the Newton family and the organization they founded to help veterans get the recognition they deserve. I hope all Americans will set aside every May 1st as a day to honor our nation’s wounded and ill service members.”
Silver Star Families of America (SSFOA) is a national non-profit program headquartered in Clever, Mo. The organization honors and assists members of the Armed Forces and their families from every branch of service and from all wars. SSFOA provides assistance to veterans who have suffered illness or injury in the course of their service, and distributes Silver Star Flags and care packages to wounded veterans and their families. Diana Newton, who founded the organization with her husband, Steve, passed away earlier this year.
In addition to Blunt and Hawley, the measure was cosponsored by U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (W. Va.).

Title: Sen. Hawley on Crisis at the Border: The Behavior of this Congress is Pathetic
Date: Wednesday, June 26, 2019

Content:
One day after a photo was published of an El Salvadoran father who drowned to death with his 23-month-old daughter, Senator Hawley called Congress’ inaction on the crisis at the border “pathetic” and a “complete dereliction of duty.” Senator Hawley made the comments at a hearing on border security in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
The behavior of this congress is absolutely pathetic. I mean, it is just pathetic.
People up here should be apologizing to you for the total dereliction of duty that this Congress has undertaken. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. This is, by my count the, the sixth hearing, full hearing, I’ve sat through in 4 months on the border. Which is great. I’m glad we’re paying some attention to it.
The problem is this Congress never does anything. This Congress refuses to do anything. We know what the facts are, you’ve outlined them again today:
CBP is overcapacity, underfunded, undermanned.
ICE: overcapacity, underfunded.
HHS: overcapacity, underfunded.
Yet this Congress will do nothing.
Meanwhile, the cartels and the smuggling rings, what are they doing? They’re lying to vulnerable families, exploiting children, in order to turn profits and abuse our broken asylum system.
And we know what needs to happen. We know we need to reform the asylum system. We know we’ve got to stop the pull factors, as well as address the push factors. We know all that, but this Congress won’t do anything.
This morning I’ve heard, just from my colleagues across the aisle this morning, I’ve heard statements like: “I’m heartbroken.” “No one is more vulnerable than a child.” “The status quo is unacceptable.” “It is unsustainable.”
But, yet we don’t do anything to change it. And there’s no will to change it. Children are being exploited. This morning we woke up to the picture of the man from El Salvador and his young daughter, dead, face-down in the water. Why? Because they were exploited. Who knows how much that poor gentleman paid to some smuggling ring who told him that if he just came to the United States, to our border and claimed asylum, he’d automatically get in. That was a lie.
Who knows what lies he was told. And here he ends up, he and his little baby, dead. And this Congress still refuses to act. I mean, it is absolutely unconscionable.
We know what needs to be done. Nobody will do it. And my view is we can talk, and talk, and talk, but until this Congress is willing to take some action, I mean, I’m just sorry, for what it is you have to deal with. I’m sorry that this Congress has left you without the resources you need. I’m sorry that this Congress has not done its duty. I’m sorry that this Congress has left, not only our southern border exposed and vulnerable, but has left children exploited day, after day, after day. And until this wretched Congress decides to do something, I don’t know why we even bother to have these hearings. I don’t know why it even matters. Because this Congress will not act. This Congress refuses to act. And it’s a complete dereliction of duty.
So thank you, gentlemen, for your service. Thank you for what you are doing.
I would say to the President – I would encourage the President to take every action that he possibly can within the bounds of the law to address this crisis and secure the border because it is clear to me that this Congress will not act in any meaningful way. So as long as this Congress refuses to act, the President needs to act, and so I urge him and urge the administration to do everything within their lawful authority to address this crisis because this Congress is not going to.

Title: Senators Warner and Hawley Introduce Bill to Force Social Media Companies to Disclose How They Are Monetizing User Data
Date: Monday, June 24, 2019

Content:
Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) will introduce the
Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, bipartisan legislation that will require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to tell consumers and financial regulators exactly what data they are collecting from consumers, and how it is being leveraged by the platform for profit.
“When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These ‘free’ products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,” said
Senator Hawley. “Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these ‘free’ services actually cost.”
“For years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that’s not true – you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,” said
Senator Warner. “But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they’re giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it’s worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.”
As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable, albeit intangible, assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The
DASHBOARD Act
will:
Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.
Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they’ve collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.
Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected – and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.
Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.
The DASHBOARD Act is the second tech-focused bill Hawley and Warner have partnered on. The first was Hawley’s
Do Not Track Act, which would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) “Do Not Call” list and allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection.

Title: Senators Hawley and Blunt Introduce Resolution to Congratulate St. Louis Blues on Stanley Cup Championship
Date: Thursday, June 20, 2019

Content:
Today Missouri’s U.S. Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Amend Section 230 Immunity for Big Tech Companies
Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the
Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, a major update to the way big tech companies are treated under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA).
Sen. Hawley’s legislation removes the immunity big tech companies receive under Section 230 unless they submit to an external audit that proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral. Sen. Hawley’s legislation does not apply to small and medium-sized tech companies.
“With Section 230, tech companies get a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability in exchange for providing a forum free of political censorship,” said
Senator Hawley. “Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, big tech has failed to hold up its end of the bargain.
“There’s a growing list of evidence that shows big tech companies making editorial decisions to censor viewpoints they disagree with. Even worse, the entire process is shrouded in secrecy because these companies refuse to make their protocols public. This legislation simply states that if the tech giants want to keep their government-granted immunity, they must bring transparency and accountability to their editorial processes and prove that they don’t discriminate.”
Background
The Communications Decency Act protects companies from liability for illegal content posted by third parties. Congress passed this law in 1996 when the Internet was in its infancy and Congress was concerned that subjecting hosting platforms to the same civil liability as all other businesses would chill their growth.
But the Internet has long passed its infancy. The largest and most powerful companies today are big tech companies. And they have enormous resources and advanced algorithms that they can use to help them moderate content. Those companies should not receive this government subsidy free of any responsibility.
Because these companies control the very information we receive, we must ensure that they moderate content in a politically neutral manner. Today’s most powerful companies must not be allowed to interfere with the policy Congress established, when passing the CDA, to ensure “a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(3).
It is time to shine light onto what big tech companies do and force them to provide transparency about their content moderation practices.
What Senator Hawley’s bill does
Removes automatic immunity under Section 230 from big tech companies
Gives big tech companies the ability to earn immunity through external audits
Big tech companies would have to prove to the FTC by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral
The FTC could not certify big tech companies for immunity except by a supermajority vote
Big tech companies would be responsible for the cost of conducting audits
Big tech companies would have to reapply for immunity every two years
Preserves existing immunity for small and medium-sized companies
The bill applies only to companies with more than 30 million active monthly users in the U.S., more than 300 million active monthly users worldwide, or who have more than $500 million in global annual revenue

Title: Senator Hawley Takes Steps to Stop Foreign Theft of Sensitive American Research with New Bill, NDAA Amendment
Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley introduced the
Protect Our Universities Act of 2019
to safeguard sensitive, national security-related academic research from Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services. The text will also be submitted as a Senate amendment to the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is currently going through markups in the House and Senate.
The bill requires research students from these nations to undergo a background screening by the U.S. government if they wish to participate in “sensitive research projects,” as designated by a new task force led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bill also prohibits sensitive research projects from using technologies developed by companies like Huawei, ZTE, Kaspersky, and others.
“America’s universities cultivate the free and open exchange of ideas and information, all with the intent of making the world a better place. Unfortunately, they are also key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China, but Russia and Iran,”
Senator Josh Hawley said.
“For too long, these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security. This bill takes much-needed steps to ensure our research stays out of the hands of foreign adversaries who are proactively rooting for our failure. Our scientific exchange must not be exploited to advance the destructive agendas of Beijing, Moscow, or Tehran.”
Congressman Jim Banks (IN-03), who introduced similar legislation in the House, said,
“National security and Intelligence Community leaders have continually warned us about students from adversarial nations infiltrating our universities to engage in federally-funded foundational research. We cannot afford to ignore this threat any longer. President Trump’s Executive Order effectively banning Huawei products was a great step forward, but we must do more to protect our nation’s sensitive research from adversarial regimes. I thank Senator Hawley for joining me in this initiative.”
Background
One frontier in the U.S. competition with China, Russia, and Iran is these countries’ exploitation of the American higher education system.
The sciences are a particularly vulnerable setting for foreign espionage and IP theft, with Chinese, Russian, and Iranian students able to gain access to research programs funded by the U.S. government and which support U.S. government programs. Although some
universities have begun taking action
– for example, MIT recently announced it would end partnerships with Huawei and ZTE – many remain targets and are slow to respond.
Examples in the news:
“US Intelligence accuses China of using student spies to steal secrets” (Tal Axelrod, The Hill, Feb. 2, 2019)
“Western universities may be inadvertently helping China’s military: Report” (Nyshka Chandran, CNBC, Nov. 1, 2018)
“Why Russian spies really like American universities” (Daniel Golden, ProPublica, July 23, 2018).
“China has spies across U.S. universities and FBI is constantly monitoring them, FBI Director Wray Says” (Greg Price, Newsweek, Feb. 14, 2018)
The “Protect Our Universities Act of 2019” would:
Establish a DHS-led interagency task force to identify sensitive research projects occurring at institutions of higher education that are funded by task force member agencies and address “sensitive research topics,” as defined by the task force member agencies.
Require students from China, Russia, and Iran to undergo a background screening by the U.S. government if they wish to participate in a sensitive research project.
Minimize disruption to research activities at institutions of higher education and ensure these institutions are able to petition findings and contest outcomes of the screening process.
Prevent technology developed by companies like Huawei, ZTE, Kaspersky, and others from being used in sensitive research projects.

Title: Sen. Hawley Sends Letter to Google CEO Regarding Chinese Translation “Mistake” Amidst Hong Kong Protests
Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Google CEO Sudar Pichai expressing concern regarding Google’s role in the spread of misinformation during pro-democracy protests in Hong-Kong.
Agence France-Presse
reported that Google mistakenly mistranslated the phrase, “I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China,” to, “I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China.”
In his letter,
Senator Hawley
writes, “[G]iven Google’s close relationship with Beijing and financial incentive to remain close to that authoritarian government, I remain concerned that Google may have been negligent in performing the due diligence that could have averted this mistranslation at a juncture where precision of message is so critical.”

June 18, 2019
Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google, LLC
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai,
I write to express concern regarding Google’s role in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. On June 14, 2019, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Google Translate mistranslated the phrase, “I am sad to see Hong Kong become part of China,” to, “I am happy to see Hong Kong become part of China [italics added],” for a period of approximately one hour during the protests. The resulting mistranslation aligned with the narrative advanced by the Government of the People’s Republic of China concerning the protests.
Responding to the AFP report, a Google spokesman said, “Google Translate is an automatic translator, using patterns from millions of existing translations to help decide on the best translation for you…These automatic systems can sometimes make unintentional mistakes like translating a negative to a positive.” Yet, given Google’s close relationship with Beijing and financial incentive to remain close to that authoritarian government, I remain concerned that Google may have been negligent in performing the due diligence that could have averted this mistranslation at a juncture where precision of message is so critical.
That due diligence is particularly necessary in the case of Hong Kong, as the Government of the People’s Republic of China is intent on reasserting control over the city and has long used information operations to advance its political agenda. Inasmuch as Google provides a space for the people of Hong Kong to share information, that space will be targeted for manipulation by Beijing. It thus falls upon Google to place principle over profit and protect its products against such interference – even if doing so might cause discomfort in the company’s dealings with Beijing.
The people of Hong Kong are fighting now to preserve the democratic character of their city. Millions of those people are relying on Google’s products to advance this noble cause. As a company whose success stems in part from the liberties inherent to American society, Google ought to take this cause as seriously as those using its platforms to fight for their freedom.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Senators Hawley, Blunt, Roberts, and Moran Applaud Kansas City Selection for New ERS & NIFA Location
Date: Thursday, June 13, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Roy Blunt (Mo.), Pat Roberts (Kan.), and Jerry Moran (Kan.) today applauded U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue’s selection of the Kansas City area as the new location for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).
“This is outstanding news for the Kansas City region. We’re home to some of the hardest working farmers in the country, so this is a fantastic decision by the USDA,”
said Hawley. “As the new home of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Missouri and Kansas will continue to lead in the research and development of American agricultural policy for the 21st century. We are grateful for the job opportunities and renewed partnership this move creates for our state.”
“Today’s announcement is great news for the Kansas City region and our state,”
said Blunt. “These agencies will bring hundreds of good-paying jobs to the area and enhance Missouri’s role as a national leader in ag research. Secretary Perdue made the right choice in selecting Kansas City, which is a great place to live and work. The challenges and opportunities have never been greater than they will be in the next 25 years. These research agencies do great work, and will be at the cutting edge of agriculture and well located for assistance and examples as they do their job.”
“I am excited to hear USDA selected Kansas City as the new location for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Agricultural research is a critical function of USDA, and I am committed to ensuring we continue to support and strengthen the research mission that our US producers rely on. Kansas City is an obvious choice, as many other USDA agencies in the area partner closely with stakeholders,”
said Roberts. “The vital research that will occur at the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) and already occurs throughout the KC Animal Health Corridor makes Kansas City a natural fit. I am pleased that USDA recognizes the rich resources the heartland provides.”
“After months of advocating to Secretary Perdue that NIFA and ERS ought to be relocated to the Kansas City area, I’m thrilled that USDA has selected Kansas City to house these critical research agencies,”
said Moran. “The animal health corridor, stretching from Manhattan, Kansas to Columbia, Missouri, is the largest concentration of animal health companies in the world, and Kansas is also the home of the National Bio and Agro-defense Facility – and today’s decision further bolsters Kansas City’s status as a national leader in the ag industry. It is always positive when our government can operate outside of Washington and closer to the people it serves, and I am certain that the decision to relocate NIFA and ERS to Kansas City is a good one. I look forward to helping welcome these USDA agencies and employees to Kansas City.”
Both ERS and NIFA are key research arms of USDA, currently located in the Washington, D.C. area. Perdue launched an effort to relocate the two key research arms of the Department outside of the Washington, D.C., region.

Title: Senator Hawley Questions Acting DHS Secretary on Exploitation of Children at the Border
Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019

Content:
Today, Senator Josh Hawley questioned the Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the exploitation of children at the southern border during a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing.
Acting Secretary McAleenan confirmed that Congress has refused to provide the resources necessary to end the reign of cartels and smugglers at the southern border and stop the horrific abuses of children, including child recycling rings.
Highlighted Excerpt:
HAWLEY: I don’t think failure to act is really quite right. I think that’s way too generous. It’s refusal to act. Because Congress could act, they could act if they wanted to, but they don’t want to. That’s the bottom line. So we are dealing with children – I am the father of two little boys. The idea that you would have children recycled, purchased, used for profit by these cartels and by these smuggling rings, and that this Congress will just sit by and say, “We’re just not going to do anything. There really is no crisis. There is nothing we can agree on.” is absolutely unbelievable to me. It is the worst failure of leadership that I can think of. I mean it’s just absolutely stunning.

Title: On 75th D-Day Anniversary, Senator Hawley Joins Bipartisan Delegation in Normandy
Date: Thursday, June 06, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined a bipartisan Senate delegation in Normandy, France, for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion by Allied forces during World War II. The 17-senator delegation joined President Donald J. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at an official ceremony at the American Cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer to mark the milestone.
Prior to the ceremony, Senator Hawley and the delegation met with World War II veterans from the United States who made the trip for the special occasion. The delegation also met with General Tod Wolters, commander of U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Supreme Allied Commander Europe.
On June 6, 1944, with American and Allied paratroopers positioned behind enemy lines, Allied forces waded through waist-deep waters amid hailing enemy gunfire to storm the beaches of Normandy, France, in an invasion called Operation Overlord, or “D-Day” as it is commonly referred to today. It was a joint naval, air and land assault marking the start of Allied forces’ campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied Europe. More than 6,000 Americans died that day, but their sacrifice and heroism marked the beginning of the end of World War II.
“It’s a great honor to join the President and my colleagues in traveling with World War II veterans to honor their service on the 75th anniversary of D-Day,” said
Senator Hawley. “The greatest generation stormed the beaches of Normandy in defense of the freedom we enjoy today. We are forever grateful for their sacrifices and I am humbled to be with them for this historic event.”
The D-Day 75th anniversary ceremony was attended by more than 150 veterans, U.S. elected officials, U.S. armed service members, dignitaries from our allied partners in the French government, and other participants.

Title: Sen. Josh Hawley and Colleagues Urge Pharma Industry to Provide Solutions to Lower Prescription Drug Prices
Date: Thursday, June 06, 2019

Content:
Today, Senator Josh Hawley, along with Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer, Cindy Hyde-Smith and Dan Sullivan, sent a letter to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America asking that they provide solutions to address the rising cost of prescription drugs. Senator Hawley is committed to lowering the cost of prescription drugs and putting the American consumer back in charge of their healthcare decisions.
This year, Senator Hawley joined Senator Scott in introducing the
America First Drug Pricing Plan
to address the soaring costs of prescription drugs by promoting transparency and preventing drug companies from forcing American consumers to subsidize low drug prices in foreign countries.

June 5, 2019
Mr. Stephen J. Ubl
President and CEO
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)
Dear Mr. Ubl,
We hear it every day in our states. Drug prices are too high. Patients are paying more and more every year for life-saving drugs, and some are forced to go without those treatments because they simply cannot afford them.
Soaring drug prices are a serious problem and a problem Washington should have addressed long ago. We cannot understand why Americans pay two to six times more than the rest of the world for brand name prescription drugs or why the U.S. comprised 42% of global pharmaceutical revenues based on 2016 data. American consumers should not be subsidizing European countries so they can keep prices low for their consumers. The system needs to change.
Transparency in health care costs is key to giving patients flexibility and control over their health care decisions. American consumers should always come first, and it is time for U.S. companies to be more transparent and bring down the prices of prescriptions drugs for Americans relative to Canada, Europe and other developed nations.
We write today to ask, as the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry, what solutions does your association have that would increase transparency and directly lower the list price of drugs for consumers? What specific plans do you have to address price disparities in the international market? And are you willing to work with us to find real solutions to help the American people?
In Washington, there is often too much finger pointing and not enough problem solving. We do not accept that. We are working to find solutions that directly help patients get the health care they deserve. Thank you in advance for your response. We look forward to your cooperation as we work together to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
Sincerely,
Senator Rick Scott
Senator Josh Hawley
Senator Marco Rubio
Senator Ron Johnson
Senator Mike Braun

Title: Senator Hawley Asks Tim Cook to Provide Apple Customers with a “Do Not Track” Option
Date: Tuesday, June 04, 2019

Content:
As Apple
convenes
its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking him to voluntarily provide Apple customers with a “Do Not Track” option. Senator Hawley recently
introduced
the Do Not Track Act, which would create a system similar to the “Do Not Call” list, but for data tracking.
Sen. Hawley’s letter follows a
report
that Apple’s App Store does not stop developers from hiding software in their apps designed to track users and harvest massive amounts of data unrelated to app functionality. In his letter, Senator Hawley notes that Cook has been highly critical of such practices in the past, famously
writing, “Let’s be clear: you never signed up for that.”
In his letter, Sen. Hawley writes, “I am optimistic that Congress will give my bipartisan bill serious consideration, but you have the power to provide these protections to your customers even before Congress acts. If your company is serious about protecting privacy, you should give your customers the power to block all companies from collecting or sharing any data that is not indispensable to the companies’ online services.”
Sen. Hawley ends his letter by noting that Cook has a chance to “make good on [his] promise to be an industry leader” by implementing the principles of the Do Not Track Act.
Read the full letter
here
or below:
—
Mr. Tim Cook
Chief Executive Officer
Apple, Inc.
1 Apple Park Way
Cupertino, CA 95014
Dear Mr. Cook:
Your company enjoys a better reputation than most large tech firms when it comes to privacy. I was pleased, for example, to see Apple announce yesterday that it will restrict the ability of apps to request blanket, permanent consent for location services and that Apple will prohibit apps from capturing information about which Wi-Fi signals users access.
But you can still do better. Recent reports reveal that the App Store does not stop developers from hiding software in their apps designed to track users and harvest massive amounts of data unrelated to app functionality.
[1]
To use your own words, we “never signed up for that.”
[2]
These reports reveal widespread abuse of user trust by app developers. They note that, without adequately informing users, developers hide trackers that transmit reams of data to ad networks and other third parties. Your policies allow users to limit app permissions for system-level data like personal contacts and location services. Yet these reports reveal that your policies do not prevent apps from pilfering mountains of other data and then sharing it with third parties.
Even worse, the use of middleware drastically enhances the scope of this abuse. Developers typically incorporate bundles of code from other developers. So a person who uses an app potentially exposes her data not only to the app developer, but also every app developer on which the principal developer relied. These sub-developers routinely design their software to thwart reasonable attempts to restrict tracking. For example, experts recommend limiting tracking by resetting device advertising IDs. But apps often include middleware that frustrates these efforts by collecting permanent device IDs. And because app developers either don’t police middleware creators or consciously allow those creators to abuse the app interface, these apps regularly expose users to alarming violations of federal privacy law. For example, the developer of Angry Birds, Rovio, sends data through its apps to 43 different companies, at least three of which are almost certainly violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
Fortunately, there is a simple solution. I have introduced bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Feinstein, to end these abusive data practices. The Do Not Track Act would prohibit any company from collecting any data beyond what is indispensable to its online services.

All a person would need to do to obtain this protection is click a single button one time.
I am optimistic that Congress will give my bipartisan bill serious consideration, but you have the power to provide these protections to your customers even before Congress acts. If your company is serious about protecting privacy, you should give your customers the power to block all companies from collecting or sharing any data that is not indispensable to the companies’ online services. And you can do so without having to pore through every line of middleware code.
The method for doing so is simple. You need only require app developers, as a condition for appearing in the App Store, to certify that their apps will not collect data beyond what is indispensable to the companies’ online services if a user activates the “Limit Ad Tracking” feature that you already provide. If a company collects this data after certifying otherwise, it would clearly violate federal and state prohibitions on unfair or deceptive trade practices, and existing remedies would be available to protect consumers.
My bill takes a giant leap toward ending the greedy data-grabbing practices of bad-actor companies. But this effort should not be led by Congress alone. You have it in your power to make good on your promise to be an industry leader. You should do so by implementing the principles behind my Do Not Track bill immediately.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley

Title: Three Decades After Tiananmen Square Massacre, Hawley Urges Pressure on China Over Ongoing Sovereignty and Human Rights Violations
Date: Tuesday, June 04, 2019

Content:
On the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square tragedy, when peaceful protesters were mowed down and killed in the public eye by the Chinese government, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is urging his colleagues and the administration to keep up the pressure on the Communist Party of China for its ongoing human rights and sovereignty violations.
Senator Hawley is taking two steps to highlight the Chinese government’s brazen disregard for peace and freedom in the region today, including the
introduction of a resolution
that reiterates the United States’ support of Taiwan against aggression from China and a
letter to the administration
expressing deep concern over recent reports outlining the Chinese government’s facilitation of the trafficking of North Korean women and children.
“Thirty years after the massacre at Tiananmen Square, the Communist Party of China remains committed to imposing its will not only on the Chinese people, but also on those of its neighbors,” said
Senator Hawley. “It has not learned from one of the worst atrocities in its modern history, and today, the United States has an obligation to speak out.”
Highlights
Senator Hawley’s
resolution, introduced with Senator Cotton, supporting measures taken by the Government of Taiwan to deter, or if so compelled, defeat, aggression by the Government of the People’s Republic of China:
Reaffirms and encourages US-Taiwan relations;
Condemns threats by the Chinese government against Taiwan;
Urges Taiwan to continue to develop a lethal and resilient defensive posture in accordance with its new Overall Defense Concept; and
Calls on the governments of all nations to support a strong and democratic Taiwan in furtherance of the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Senator Hawley’s
letter
— cosigned by Senators Cruz, Rubio, and Blackburn to Secretaries Pompeo, Mnuchin, and Ross — outlining human rights violations stemming from the Chinese government’s role in abetting the trafficking of North Korean women and children:
Urges the US to raise reports of China’s failure to properly address human trafficking and rampant human rights violations when engaging with senior Chinese government officials;
Proposes the consideration of punitive measures, including sanctions, against officials and entities connected to the trafficking of North Korean women and children;
Calls on the administration to elevate these concerns with our allies and work with them to develop multilateral efforts to combat these cruel human rights violations; and
Requests a briefing on China and North Korea’s ongoing role in this crisis.

Title: Facebook Stands Firm in Their Right to Snoop on Users’ Encrypted Messaging
Date: Wednesday, May 29, 2019

Content:
As first reported by
Bloomberg, Facebook has
responded
to U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s recent
letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg
about the company’s supposed “pivot” to a privacy-focused platform. In the letter, Senator Hawley raised questions about whether such a platform could really function as advertised given Facebook’s monetization model.
“I am frankly shocked by Facebook’s response. I thought they’d swear off the creepier possibilities I raised. But instead, they doubled down,” said
Senator Hawley.
“If you share a link in encrypted messenger with a friend who clicks it, Facebook reserves the right to use cookies to figure out what that link was and what you two might have been discussing in your encrypted chat. If you send a roommate your rent money in encrypted messenger, Facebook reserves the right to use the payment metadata to figure out you might live together. And they call this ‘encrypted’ private messaging,”
Hawley continued.
“My advice to consumers is simple: when Facebook tells you its messaging services are private, you can’t trust them. I’d love to know what Brian Acton and Jan Koum are thinking as they read this response.”
A few important points to note in Facebook’s response:
Facebook refuses to swear off efforts to use metadata about encrypted messages to interpolate message content, including which links users share with each other in its encrypted messaging platform.
As Senator Hawley noted in his letter, “Facebook knows when its users are interfacing with its messaging products, and it knows through browser cookies and integration with publisher websites when users have clicked links to read articles. … In combination, these data sources might tell Facebook when its users share links clicked by others through its encrypted messaging platform and which links receive the most traffic through the messaging platform, therefore enabling Facebook to extrapolate the content of users’ conversations and add such insights to users’ advertising profiles.” In its response, Facebook refuses to preclude this possibility, noting that “there are still many open questions about what metadata we will retain and how it may be used” and that “data related to user messaging is integral to how our products currently work.”
Facebook refuses to swear off efforts to collect and use information about payments made through its encrypted platform to interpolate message content.
As Senator Hawley noted in his letter, “A payment system operated by Facebook as an intermediary within an encrypted messaging app is a potential vector for the transmission of sensitive information outside of the supposedly private ecosystem.” In response, Facebook notes that it already “collects data related to the transaction” to “provide a better experience and to better suggest products.” In response to questions about the interaction of payment information and ad targeting, it notes that “information about transactions can be used for personalization on the Facebook platform” – a response that reinforces concerns that payments will be a vector for privacy leakage within Facebook’s encrypted ecosystem.
Facebook refuses to swear off the use of data collected from closed or secret groups for “personalization” and ad targeting.
As Senator Hawley noted in his letter, “The principles that have led to your decision to encrypt private messages necessarily suggest that users of groups – certainly of closed or secret groups – deserve the same protections afforded to users of private messenger.” In its response, Facebook reserves the right to collect data on content shared in Facebook groups “as one of many signals that can personalize your experience on the platform.”
Despite promoting its new platform as privacy protective, Facebook has yet to make critical decisions about the privacy of data shared within it.
Facebook repeatedly references “many open questions” about its use of metadata to snoop on users’ supposedly private interactions. Such open questions have not prevented its from marketing its new platform as privacy protective.

May 27, 2019
The Honorable Josh Hawley
United States Senate
212 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator Hawley,
Thank you for your letter of May 13, 2019, regarding privacy and data use by Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The people who use Facebook—and lawmakers—should have a clear understanding of the kinds of data we collect and how we use that data, and we appreciate your interest in this area. As Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote in a Facebook post (and reiterated in his F8 keynote), the shift to a privacy-focused platform will focus around several key principles: creating spaces for private interactions, reducing permanence, encryption, safety, interoperability, and secure data storage. This is a work in progress that we expect to take several years, and it is still in its early stages.
As he noted further in his post, we plan to consult widely on the challenges this approach presents.
The decisions we’ll face along the way will mean taking positions on important issues concerning the future of the internet. We understand there are a lot of tradeoffs to get right, and we’re committed to consulting with experts and discussing the best way forward. This will take some time, but we’re not going to develop this major change in our direction behind closed doors. We’re going to do this as openly and collaboratively as we can because many of these issues affect different parts of society.
As part of that consultative effort, we welcome the opportunity to engage with your office around this effort.
With that context in mind, below, please find answers to your specific questions.
Messaging Privacy
What metadata will Facebook maintain related to user messaging interactions, and for how long? How will it use such data? Will such data supplement other data in user profiles to enhance ad targeting?
There are still many open questions about what metadata we will retain. An important element of our privacy-focused messaging is to collect less personal data in the first place, which is the way WhatsApp, for example, was built from the outset. Another goal will be to limit the amount of time we store messaging metadata. We will use this data primarily to operate our services and to run our spam and safety systems, but we are open to evaluating the amount of time we need to retain data in the interest of reducing permanence. We’ve committed to consult privacy and safety experts, law enforcement, and governments on the best way forward, which we have already begun doing.
Will Facebook make any attempt to determine, by comparing such metadata with other data sources, anything about the content of users’ conversations, such as which articles Facebook users have likely shared with each other via encrypted messenger?
As described above, there are still many open questions about what metadata we will retain and how it may be used. We’ve committed to consult safety and privacy experts, law enforcement, and governments on the best way forward. With the shift to end-to-end encryption, our goal is to ensure that message content can only be seen by the intended recipients—not hackers, criminals, or even Facebook.
Will it commit to establishing a firewall between data related to user messaging, including metadata related to links shared through the platform, and the rest of its data infrastructure?
As described above, there are still many outstanding questions around our plans to use metadata, or even what metadata will be maintained. However, it is worth noting that data related to user messaging is integral to how our products currently work (such as receiving a notification within Facebook.com when you receive a Facebook message) and to our ability to conduct investigations that help make the platform safer, reduce SPAM and fraud, and cooperate with law enforcement requests. This data will be even more integral to our safety and integrity efforts once the content of messages is end-to-end encrypted.
If not, will Facebook cooperate with inquiries by Congress and the FTC regarding whether its public representations about this messaging platform are misinforming consumers?
Facebook will of course cooperate fully with any Congressional or agency inquiries.
Commerce and Payments
What metadata will Facebook collect and retain relating to commercial interactions through its messaging platform and payments more generally? How does Facebook define “non-public personal financial information,” and does such information include the names of participants in payment transactions? What metadata categories are excluded from this definition?
Today, payment transactions take place on Facebook either through Facebook Payments Inc. (which processes P2P payments in the U.S. over Messenger, donations to U.S. charities onboarded to our fundraising platform, and payment for digital goods on games within Facebook on the web) or a commercial partner (e.g. PayPal powers transactions for certain U.S.-based Shops on Pages and Instagram Checkout in the US).
Facebook Payments Inc. is a financial institution and subsidiary of Facebook Inc. with its own Privacy Policy. Facebook Payments Inc. collects non-public personal financial information data necessary for payment transactions (e.g. payment credentials) in accordance with GLBA, and it is PCI-DSS compliant. Payment card information is stored in a separate PCI-DSS compliant environment.
As Facebook is the platform on which these transactions take place, Facebook Inc. also collects data related to the transaction (e.g. purchase made, merchant, transaction amount, date, time), similar to any other commerce platform. For example, Facebook collects information related to interactions on Marketplace, which is used to provide a better experience and to better suggest products.
How will data and metadata relating to commercial and other payment interactions–including data relating to the origin and conclusion of encrypted private chats with advertisers or Facebook contacts as well as data on payments occurring within such chats–be used by Facebook?
As noted above, there are still many open questions about what metadata we will retain and how it may be used. We’ve committed to consult safety and privacy experts, law enforcement, and governments on the best way forward.
Will such data inform Facebook’s advertising and other data-based personalization algorithms?
Payment account information (e.g. credit card number or bank account information) is not used for Facebook advertising or personalization. Similar to other direct interactions users make on Facebook, information about transactions can be used for personalization on the Facebook platform in accordance with Facebook’s data policy.
What commitments will Facebook make to wall off such data from the rest of its data collection and advertising algorithms to ensure user confidence in the ostensible privacy of its private messaging platform? Will any such data be exempted from such commitments?
As described above, Facebook Payments Inc. already stores payment card information in a separate PCI-DSS compliant environment. As for metadata, as previously noted, data related to user messaging is integral to how our products currently work (such as receiving a notification within Facebook.com when you receive a Facebook message) and to our ability to conduct investigations that help make the platform safer, reduce SPAM and fraud, and cooperate with law enforcement requests. We are committed to continuing to consult with safety and privacy experts, law enforcement, governments, and regulators on how best to comply with any applicable regulations and ensure user confidence in our platform.
Groups and Events
Will encryption be available for private messages between more than two participants?
Yes. WhatsApp encrypts group conversations today, and we plan to use WhatsApp’s privacy model as a starting place for the private messaging future.
Will Facebook commit to apply the same data encryption protocols used in private messenger to Facebook groups?
Facebook’s encryption efforts are beginning with our messaging platforms, the most fundamental and private use case. This vision for messaging is a complement to our current products that are focused on the more public town square, such as Facebook Groups, which are well-suited for easily finding new communities of people with similar interests. We do not currently plan to end-to-end encrypt the content shared in Facebook Groups.
Will it make any privacy-protective distinctions with respect to its own data collection for user profiling and advertisement between data shared in open groups and data shared in closed and secret groups?
The Groups privacy model gives Group administrators the ability to choose who can see the content of the group and whether it is discoverable by non-members on Facebook. In order to give all Groups meaningful and relevant features, we use Facebook Group membership as one of many signals that can personalize your experience on the platform.
Will it allow advertisement targeted to groups, and will the advertising allowed differ between different categories of groups?
We currently do not allow targeting to groups. As we add monetization options across our products, we will continue to make sure those ads products reflect our existing advertising principles, including limiting categories advertisers can target based on.
Changes to the Platform and Effect on Publishers
What steps have you taken in recent months to prepare publishers dependent on your platform for the announcements made at F8? If you have not taken such steps, why not?
Facebook has multiple channels for communication with publishers about changes to our products that might impact them. Those communications may vary based on what kind of publisher we’re reaching out to (a local small business, a multinational corporation that is a managed client, a news publisher, etc.), but in general that outreach includes, but is not limited to:
Announcements shared in our News Room and on our various properties, such as the Facebook for Business Page, the Facebook Politics and Government Page, and the News Feed FYI blog;
Press outreach about product changes in national and trade publications;
Special channels for particular types of publishers, such as the Facebook Journalism
Project Community Network;
Updates to the Facebook Help Center;
Dedicated support channels for Facebook
Outreach to certain partners who have managed relationships;
Livestreaming events where announcements are made, such as F8;
Local events, such as Facebook Boost Your Business, Community Boost, and pop-up events;
Participation in trainings, conferences, and other large meetings, which might include Help Desks or information booths.
=
Thank you again for the opportunity to address these questions. As noted above, we are in the early stages of this process. We are committed to keeping members of Congress and their staff informed and engaged as we move forward, and we would be happy to brief you and your staff on these issues as requested.
Sincerely,
Kevin Martin
Vice President, U.S. Public Policy

Title: Senator Hawley Discusses Tornado and Flood Damage with Acting Homeland Security Secretary
Date: Thursday, May 23, 2019

Content:
Today during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) talked with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan about what the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can do to help Missourians recover from yesterday’s storms. Acting Secretary McAleenan told Senator Hawley that FEMA will support state and local authorities to assess damage and help people on the ground.
Moments ago, Senator Hawley announced he would no longer be heading to the southern border with HSGAC members today and instead will be heading
back to Missouri
as soon as possible.
Senator Hawley also told Acting Secretary McAleenan that Missouri needs federal assistance to help rebuild communities, farms, and towns impacted by recent flooding. Earlier this week, Senator Hawley
introduced two bills
to give farmers more say in management of the Missouri River and to make flood control the number one priority in the Army Corps’ master manual.

Title: Senators Hawley, Markey, and Blumenthal File Legislation to Stop Manipulative Video Game Practices Aimed at Children
Date: Thursday, May 23, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), filed bipartisan legislation banning the exploitation of children through “pay-to-win” and “loot box” monetization practices by the video game industry. Senator Hawley
announced
the legislation earlier this month.
Senator Hawley
said, “Only the addiction economy could produce a business model that relies on placing a casino in the hands of every child in America with the goal of getting them desperately hooked. I’m proud to introduce this landmark, bipartisan legislation to end to these exploitative practices.”
Senator Markey
said, “Today’s digital entertainment ecosystem is an online gauntlet for children. Inherently manipulative game features that take advantage of kids and turn play time into pay time should be out of bounds. I’m proud to partner with Senator Hawley and Senator Blumenthal on this important legislation because corporate profits should never come before children’s well-being.”
Senator Blumenthal said, “I’m proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation to protect kids from predatory gaming apps and hold bad actors accountable for their reprehensible practices. Congress must send a clear warning to app developers and tech companies: Children are not cash cows to exploit for profit.”
FAQ about the legislation can be accessed
here.
Bill text can be accessed
here.
Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense, said, “Tricking kids into spending money while they play games is unacceptable and should be illegal. Common Sense commends Senator Hawley for standing up to these companies that are profiting off the exploitation of kids. Parents are frustrated by these practices and industry leaders should be supporting the creation of legislation and encourage their colleagues to design products that actually benefit the well-being of kids and families.”
Josh Golin, Executive Director of Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood, said, “It is beyond unfair for developers to rig their games to manipulate children into making purchases themselves or nagging their parents to do so. Games that require additional payments to advance take advantage of children’s natural inclination to master new skills and compete. We commend Senators Hawley, Markey, and Blumenthal for introducing this important legislation to protect children from commercial exploitation.”
Tim Winter, President of the Parents Television Council, said, “We applaud Sen. Josh Hawley for his work to address a growing concern related to children and video games: Kids are getting involved in pay-to-win schemes and other in-game micro-transactions (often referred to as ‘loot boxes’) found within the games. This only encourages costly, compulsive and unhealthy behavior in children, and it creates an unforeseen financial risk for parents. It is wrong for game developers to target impressionable children in this manner. We thank Senator Hawley – and Senators Blumenthal and Markey – for this solidly bipartisan effort to help families.”
Focus on the Family
said, “Focus on the Family supports legislative efforts at the federal level that seek to protect impressionable children from the dangers of online gaming, and specifically those games that utilize ‘pay-to-win’ and ‘loot box’ monetization schemes. These dangerous, gambling-like attributes are psychologically manipulative and may cause unsophisticated users such as children to become addicted. Several nations have already taken steps to regulate or prohibit the practice. It is time that we address this issue as well. We applaud the leadership of Senator Josh Hawley and his co-sponsors for introducing a bill that addresses this problem on behalf of America’s families.”

Title: Senators Hawley and Blunt Praise Senate Passage of Disaster Aid Bill
Date: Thursday, May 23, 2019

Content:
Missouri Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt today voted in favor of a disaster aid package that includes much-needed resources for Missouri farms and communities impacted by flooding. The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 85-8.
“This is an important step forward that expedites the assistance that Missourians need,” said
Senator Hawley. “I’ve seen the devastation firsthand and talked with families who have lost everything. Passing this aid package is just one step of many toward getting folks in our state back on their feet, and we’re grateful to have it. The path toward recovery continues.”
“The flooding in our state has been completely devastating in some areas – from destroyed homes to lost crops to damaged infrastructure,” said
Senator Blunt. “Relief is finally one step closer to reaching these communities so they can recover and rebuild. It’s an important start, but as the full scope of the damage becomes clear we must be ready to provide any additional assistance this is needed. And, we need to look at ways the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can better manage the Missouri River to help prevent catastrophic flooding in the future.”
The bill includes:
$4.5 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to repair damage to farmlands, rebuild infrastructure and rural community facilities, and provide assistance for crop losses in flood impacted states, including Missouri. The bill also includes a provision Blunt worked on with Sens. Grassley (Iowa), Ernst (Iowa), and Fischer (Neb.) to extend aid eligibility to stored commodities that were lost and crops that were unable to be planted. Hawley supported that effort;
$3 billion in funding to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to repair waterways infrastructure, including $1 billion to aid repairs of local levees that were breached or damaged in Missouri and elsewhere;
$1.6 billion for the Department of Transportation’s highway emergency relief program to repair roads and bridges; and
$2.4 billion for grants to cities, counties, and states for long term-recovery, infrastructure restoration, and economic revitalization through the Community Development Block Grant program.
This week, the Missouri Senators teamed up on Hawley’s
legislation
to help prevent future catastrophic flooding by requiring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize flood control in its management of the Missouri River System.
In late March,
Blunt
and
Hawley
toured flood damage in Northwest Missouri and emphasized the need to get relief to impacted communities.

Title: Josh Hawley Op-Ed: Addiction is what Mark Zuckerberg is selling
Date: Wednesday, May 22, 2019

Content:
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are parasites. Maybe they should disappear: Senator
USA Today
By Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)
May 22, 2019
Social media consumers are getting wise to the joke that when the product is free, they’re the ones being sold. But despite the growing threat of
consumer exploitation, Washington still shrinks from confronting our social media giants.
Why?
Because the social giants have convinced the chattering class that America simply can’t do without them. Confront the industry, we’re told, and you might accidentally kill it — and with it, all the innovation it has (supposedly) brought to our society.
Maybe. But maybe social media’s innovations do our country more harm than good. Maybe social media is best understood as a parasite on productive investment, on meaningful relationships, on a healthy society.
Maybe we’d be better off if Facebook disappeared.
Ask the social giants what it is that they produce for America and you’ll hear grand statements about new forms of human interaction. But ask where their money comes from and you’ll get the real truth.
Advertising is what the social giants truly care about, and for an obvious reason. It’s how they
turn a profit. And when it comes to making money, they’ve been great innovators. They’ve designed platforms that extract massive amounts of personal data without telling consumers, then sell that data without consumers’ permission.
And in order to guarantee an audience big enough to make their ads profitable, big tech has developed a business model designed to do one thing above all: addict.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram — they devote massive amounts of money and the best years of some of the nation’s brightest minds to developing new schemes to hijack their users’
neural circuitry. That’s because social media only works — to make money , anyway — if it consumes users’ time and attention, day after day. It needs to replace the various activities we enjoyed and did perfectly well before social media existed.
Facebook is a drug that hurts its users
Social media users understand this intuitively. You don’t go on Facebook to connect with a friend when you can just as easily call him or send her a text on your phone.
You don’t log on to find an article you’ve been meaning to read when you could just as easily find it yourself with a different service designed for that purpose, like online search.
No, you log on to Facebook to be on Facebook. Just for a minute. Or maybe a few. Or maybe an hour.
Let’s be clear. This is a digital drug. And the addiction is the point. Addiction is what Mark Zuckerberg is selling.
Like other drugs, this one hurts its users. Attention spans dull. Tempers quicken. Relationships fray.
And those are the benign effects. The Journal of Pediatrics recently noted a surge in attempted suicide: more than
double the attempts
over the last decade for those under 19, with a tripling among girls and young women 10 to 24. The study’s authors can’t prove social media is to blame, but they strongly suspect it plays a critical role. Congress has a duty to investigate that potential link further.
Social media waste our time and resources
For all social media’s supposed wizardry “connecting” us to content and to each other, we’re not a more literate or more social nation thanks to social media. We are not a happier or a kinder one. We are, in fact, more
impoverished,
lonely, and
despairing.
As for what social media adds to our economy, consider this: high salaries and stock options have encouraged a generation of our brightest engineers to enter a field of little productive value. This is, to put it mildly, an opportunity missed for the nation.
What marvels might these bright minds have produced had they been oriented toward the common good? What new treatments or therapies or technologies to strengthen our people might they have discovered?
Instead, they’ve given us an addiction economy.
They can do better. We can do better. And we must.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Two Bills to Address Missouri River Flooding, Putting Farmers and Local Communities First
Date: Tuesday, May 21, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley is introducing new legislation today to address persistent issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and this year’s devastating Missouri River flooding. The two bills prioritize Missouri families and businesses along the river, especially farmers who have been ignored by the Corps.
Sen. Hawley’s “
Army Corps of Engineers Flood Control Civilian Advisory Council Act
” would first ensure farmers have a seat at the table for Corps decision-making that directly impacts their farms and local communities. It establishes a new advisory council with two members from each state along the Missouri River – as appointed by the President – to have a role in advising the Corps on how to best revise the master manual in broader terms, to fully prioritize flood control and navigation. The council will have representatives from agriculture and other river commerce industries.
Sen. Hawley’s second bill, the “
Missouri River Flood Control Prioritization Act,” is the Senate companion of Congressman Sam Graves (MO-6)’s
H.R. 2174, introduced in April. It makes flood control the number one priority in the Corps’ master manual, removes fish and wildlife as an authorized purpose, and instructs the Army Corps of Engineers to update its manual to reflect these changes within 90 days of the bill’s passage into law. Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) is an
original co-sponsor.
The Corps currently has
eight goals in their master manual that are in tension with one other, creating confusion when it comes to managing the river. The
goals are not listed in any priority order, and they include flood control, navigation, water supply, water quality control, irrigation, recreation, hydropower and fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species.
“The Missouri River flooding has once again devastated our state and it’s clear something has to change,” said
Senator Hawley. “People who live along the river regularly deal with catastrophic flooding, simply because the Army Corps is acting under conflicting priorities. What’s more, farmers feel like they have been shut out and their voices don’t matter – and that is completely unacceptable. By introducing these bills, we can get at the root of the problem, demand change, and ensure the Army Corps prioritizes the safety and sustainability of our communities.”
Congressman Graves
is the House sponsor of Hawley’s “Missouri River Flood Control Prioritization Act” and said, “Flood control must be the main priority on the Missouri River. People and property should always take precedent over fish and birds. Senator Hawley recognizes this and I’m thrilled that he is leading on this issue in the Senate. Working together, I’m hopeful that we can properly address the management priorities on the Missouri River, saving lives and livelihoods in the process.”
The bills follow Sen. Hawley’s ongoing discussions with Army Corps leadership, local officials, and farming communities along the Missouri River. Summaries of the bills can be found below.

Creates an advisory council, appointed by the President in consultation with the Senate, with two members from each state in which the Missouri River flows.
The advisory council will make recommendations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on how to prioritize flood control and navigation in the master manual.
The council must include representation from agriculture and other river commerce industries.
The council will submit a report with their recommendations to the USACE and Congress after one year, and the council will be dissolved after their report is released.
The Missouri River Flood Control Prioritization Act
:
The bill requires the USACE to make flood control management the highest priority purpose on the Missouri River system.
Fish and wildlife will no longer be an authorized purpose and therefore cannot be given priority over levees and other flood control systems that protect landowners and communities along the Missouri River system.
The Chief of Engineers will revise the Missouri River Master Manual to reflect making flood control the highest priority of any USACE civil works on the Missouri River system.
The policy change must be enacted within 90 days of the bill’s passage.

Title: Senator Hawley to Introduce Legislation to Give the American People a “Do Not Track” Option
Date: Monday, May 20, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley, a top critic of big tech’s data collection practices, announced today that he will introduce the
Do Not Track Act
to give control over personal data back to users. Similar to the national “Do Not Call” list, the
Do Not Track Act
gives every person the power to block online companies from collecting any data beyond what is necessary for the companies’ online services.
Senator Hawley said, “Big tech companies collect incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent. They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet. The American people didn’t sign up for this, so I’m introducing this legislation to finally give them control over their personal information online.”
Background
The sheer enormity of data big tech companies extract, and the unscrupulous ways they use that data, is distressing. These companies track our locations and spy on our Internet history—even when we tell them not to. In March,
a senior official at Google
admitted, under oath, that Google still tracks a user’s geolocation hundreds of times a day even after that person turns off “location history.” Facebook even
collects data on people who don’t have
a Facebook account. These companies and others exploit this harvested data to build massive profiles on users and then rake in hundreds of billions of dollars monetizing that data.
For years, industry groups promoted a program called “Do Not Track” to give users control, and the FTC endorsed the program in 2010. But the program was voluntary, and tech giants that built their businesses around exploiting data refused to voluntarily comply. This bill would give Do Not Track legal force and expand it to cover all Internet activity, not just browser-based activity.
What Senator Hawley’s Legislation Does:
Creates a program similar to the national Do Not Call list that gives every person the power, at a touch of a button, to block online companies from collecting any data beyond what is indispensable to the companies’ online services.
Prohibits companies from profiling Americans who activate Do Not Track.
Bans discriminating against people who activate Do Not Track.
Bans companies from transferring data to other companies when a user activates Do Not Track unless the first company is an intended intermediary.
Forces Internet companies to disclose to users their rights under this Act.
Imposes strict penalties for violating these provisions.
How users would activate Do Not Track:
Users would have several options to enroll, including a one-time click in the settings on their browser or downloading a simple app.

Title: U.S. Senate Unanimously Passes Senator Hawley’s Police Suicide Prevention Legislation
Date: Thursday, May 16, 2019

Content:
Today the United States Senate unanimously passed U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s bipartisan police suicide prevention legislation. Introduced with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.),
the Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019
aims to address a major crisis within the law enforcement community: officer suicide.
This is the first bill sponsored by Senator Hawley to clear the full U.S. Senate. A matching companion bill is currently being considered by the House Judiciary Committee.
“This bill provides much-needed support for the men and women of law enforcement who keep us safe every day,”
said Senator Hawley. “I am thrilled to see the overwhelming, bipartisan support for this legislation and hope the House will take action.”
“The things that first responders experience at accidents and crime scenes can be horrifying, and they often face terrible danger,”
said Whitehouse.
“Helping police officers and firefighters deal with what they must bear to keep the rest of us safe is an important duty we owe.”
Suicide is the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers–more than homicides and traffic accidents combined. According to the nonprofit Blue H.E.L.P., there were 165 confirmed officer suicides in 2018, including 4 in Missouri. Just three months ago, tragedy struck in Kansas City when a 10-year veteran of the Kansas City Police Department took his own life.
Senator Hawley’s legislation restores expired grant funding for law enforcement support services. The legislation also allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers.
Original co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Tillis (R-N.C.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cotton (R-Ark.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Scott (R-Fla.).
The bill has been endorsed by numerous law enforcement and mental health advocacy groups: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, National Sheriffs’ Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, National Fraternal Order of Police, Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department, National District Attorneys Association, and International Association of Chiefs of Police.

Title: Senator Hawley Delivers Maiden Speech in the Senate
Date: Wednesday, May 15, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley delivered his maiden speech on the floor of the United States Senate. The maiden speech is a Senate tradition where new Senators set the tone for their term by taking to the floor to deliver their first major address.
—
Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to speak in this chamber on behalf of the people of Missouri.
When I think of those who have served my state here before me, I am humbled.
And when I think of the true and strong Missourians who have sent me here, I am sobered. Because to represent them will be a great responsibility indeed.
I pledge to my fellow Missourians that I will work at this task with all the strength that God can give me. And I will serve without fear and without favor to any man.
We Missourians are known for our frankness, and today I will be frank. Because this is a moment of great need for my state and for our nation.
For this nation was born in a revolution by We the People, and premised on a revolutionary faith: that it is the people, the common man and woman, who make democracy work.
And it is the calling of every generation to renew that revolution for their day.
But in our time, our revolutionary faith is faltering. And in the heartland of this country, the great challenge of our age is unfolding.
I come from a town called Lexington, Missouri. It’s a small place, but a proud one. It’s a place where people wake early and work late to make a life for themselves and their children. It’s a place where people value honesty and gumption and life’s simple pleasures: a fine morning in a deer stand, reading to the kids before bed, Sunday dinner at Mom’s.
And though it is humble, it’s a place that reflects the dignity and quiet greatness of the working man and woman.
These are the people who explored a continent, who built the railroads, who opened the West. These are the workers whose labor launched the Industrial Revolution and whose ingenuity made the American economy the marvel of the world.
These are the families who have rallied to this country’s flag in every hour of danger and who bear the burden of defending our nation even now.
These are the patriots who man the fire department and coach the Little League.
These are the generous who give $25 a month out of their gas money to assist people halfway around the globe they will never meet just because they believe in helping others.
They don’t ask for much, and they live by a simple creed: give the best of yourself to your family, your community, and your fellow man.
And America is a place of promise, because in these hearts, honor lives.
But these working men and women are confronting crisis today. And as they do, so does our democracy.
After years of sacrifice, the great American middle is being pushed aside by a new, arrogant aristocracy. The new aristocrats seek to remake society in their own image: to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else, to fashion a culture that is dominated by their own preferences.
When they think of helping their fellow citizens, they think of making everyone else more like themselves. And Washington – Washington has just gone along. This town has embraced a politics of elite values and elite ambition rather than building opportunities to thrive in the great and broad American middle.
This has left middle America—the great American middle class—under siege: battling the loss of respect and work, the decline of home and family, an epidemic of loneliness and despair.
This is the crisis of our time.
I’m afraid you wouldn’t know it to listen to the talk of this town much of the time. As the crisis deepens, the political establishment looks the other way, rehearsing and rehashing the political debates of thirty or forty years ago.
But there is no time for that any longer. The twenty-first century is upon us. And the great struggle of this century can no longer wait.
***
The crisis that we face goes to the heart of our revolution.
The United States is unique in history as a republic governed not by a select elite, but by the working man and woman—because we believe it is through the working man and woman that God chooses to change the world.
And that change comes not through spectacular feats of daring or glory, but through everyday work and everyday sacrifice and everyday acts of courage and love.
And so it has been the proud working people, our farmers and mechanics and teachers and tradesmen, who have defined the character of this country.
But for too long now, neither our economy nor our culture has lent them much support. Instead, our policy makers have entrenched the new elites and undermined the way of life that once bound this country together.
It’s time to face the facts. Over the last forty years, our economy has worked best for those at the top: the wealthy, the well-educated. If you have a job in Silicon Valley or an expensive and prestigious degree, this economy has worked for you.
And Washington has focused on how to get more people to join this elite.
But if you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your ambition is not to start a tech business but to join the family business, to serve in the PTA or in your local church, well, you’re told that you’re not a success. And you’re told that you’re on your own.
This is no accident. The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, who set the tone for our popular culture, all belong to the same class. This economy has been their economy. They made it for themselves.
But in places like the one where I grew up, in middle Missouri, good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on are going away.
The jobs go overseas or south of the border or to cities on the coasts. And once-vibrant towns decline, taking with them the network of schools and neighborhoods and churches that make up middle class life.
Rural America has been particularly hard hit. Rural Americans’ life expectancy has not just leveled off, its actually dropped, and for women without a high school degree, that drop has been staggering.
In some rural places, residents struggle with outright deprivation. My home state contains some of the poorest counties in America, all in rural places that once boasted thriving small towns. As those communities struggle, want sets in.
But the crisis reaches well beyond economics. The message that Washington has sent our whole society is loud and clear: our elites are the people who matter—and those who aspire to join them. Everyone else is unimportant or backwards.
And millions of Americans are left with the sense that the people who run this country view them with nothing but contempt and value them as nothing but consumers.
These trends tear at our country’s social fabric, and they undermine our common ethic of citizenship.
Because being a free person, being an American, isn’t just about what you can buy.
It’s about the pride that comes in supporting a family. It’s about contributing something of worth to your community. It’s about being able to look a neighbor in the eye and know that you’re his equal.
It’s about respect. And too many Americans haven’t been getting it.
They’re certainly not getting it from our cultural elite. The media, Hollywood, academia relentlessly press their values and their priorities on the rest of us.
They advocate liberation from the duties of family and tradition. They look down on the plain virtues of patriotism, self-giving, and faith. They idealize fame and preach self-realization through consuming more stuff.
And as they do, they assault the foundations of the great American middle.
Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised, then, at the epidemic of loneliness and despair that is spreading across working communities.
Fewer young people are getting married or starting families.
Drug addiction is surging. The opioid menace has ravaged every sector, every age group, every geography of working people. And it’s not only pills. Heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, meth, and of course marijuana, have flooded our streets and our homes.
And everywhere, deaths of despair are mounting—among farmers, among the young.
Most shockingly, the young are the hope of our society, but in America today they are taking their lives in numbers never seen in our history. The well-off frequently note that our nation has never been richer, but the tragedy of youth suicide betrays a profound poverty of hope.
And is that really so surprising? Today’s youth must make their way in a society increasingly defined not by the genuine and personal love of family and church, but by the cold and judgmental world of social media.
The typical young person is bombarded by video games and violence and the relentless status-seeking imposed and modeled by our cultural elite.
There is no more shocking illustration of our cultural poverty, no more damning indictment of our cultural leaders, than these lost lives.
And the sum of it all is that too many Americans are losing their standing as citizens. They are losing their voice in the life of this nation. And with that, they are losing their liberty.
Because to be free is to have a voice, it is to have a say, it is to have the power of self-government.
***
The chattering class often tells us that all of this—the jobs, the despair, the loss of standing—is the result of forces beyond anyone’s control. As if that’s an excuse to do nothing.
But in fact, it’s not true.
Today’s society benefits those who shaped it, and it has been shaped not by working men and women, but by the new aristocratic elite.
Big banks, big tech, big multi-national corporations, along with their allies in the academy and the media—these are the aristocrats of our age.
They live in the United States, but they consider themselves citizens of the world.
They operate businesses or run universities here, but their primary loyalty is to their own agenda for a more unified, progressive—and profitable—global order.
These modern aristocrats often claim to be a meritocracy. And many of them truly believe they are. What they don’t see, or won’t acknowledge, is that the society they have built works mainly for themselves.
They’ve effectively run this country for decades. And their legacy is national division and national decline.
***
Mr. President, it is time to reclaim our revolutionary heritage and reassert the democracy of We the People.
To those who despair at the task ahead, I say the hour is not too late, the crisis is not too deep for the determined effort of a great people.
And to those who feel forgotten and unheard, I say this is your time.
Now we must stand together to renew the promise of our enduring revolution.
We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past, and forge a new politics of national renewal.
We must begin by acknowledging that GDP growth alone cannot be the measure of this nation’s greatness. And so, it cannot be the only aim of this nation’s policy. Because our purpose is not to make a few people wealthy, but to sustain a great democracy.
And so, we need not just a bigger economy, but a better society.
We need a society that offers rewarding work for every worker who wants it, wherever she is from, whatever degree he might have, whether their ambition is to start a business or to start a family.
We need a society that will allow towns and neighborhoods to flourish across the great heartland of this country, not just in the mega-cities of the coasts.
We need a society that puts American workers first, that prioritizes them over cheap goods from abroad, and offers them the chance to better their station.
All this we must fight for and more.
We need to repair the torn fabric of our common life. We need a politics that prioritizes strong marriages and encourages strong families, where children can know their parents and be nurtured by their love.
We need strong schools and churches and co-ops.
Because these are the things that make liberty possible.
For liberty is more than selling or buying or the right to be left alone. Liberty is the ability to master our own fate and as a free people, to set our own course.
That’s the promise of the American revolution. And we will renew it for our day.
Washington has ignored the need for this renewal for too long. It has rested easy with the priorities of an earlier age. Now it must wake up and face the facts of this day.
Now we must ask new questions, force new debates, articulate new priorities and find new solutions to make the great American middle thrive again.
This is not the work of a day or a season. It is the work of a generation.
We will make it the work of this generation, and so do our part to see the success of liberty in our time.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Support First Responders
Date: Wednesday, May 15, 2019

Content:
Senators Hawley, Blunt, Scott, and Hassan team up with Rep. Hartzler to introduce Senate legislation to improve Missouri flood assistance
Today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), along with U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), introduced the National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act to eliminate a
misguided policy
that currently prevents federal employees from assisting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) efforts.
US&R task forces are heroes who deploy after disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or gas explosions. There are 28 US&R task forces nationwide, including
Missouri Task Force 1
which recently offered to help with flood recovery efforts in Missouri. The legislation introduced in the Senate today would cut through the red tape to allow all federal employees to participate in these task forces and help rebuild communities in need.
“FEMA’s decision to bar federal employees from participating in US&R task forces doesn’t make any sense. We should be encouraging more people to help disaster victims, not less,”
said Senator Hawley.
“This legislation makes it clear that federal employees willing to volunteer in US&R disaster relief efforts should be allowed to do so.”
“The work these men and women do is challenging, dangerous, and vital to the safety of communities in Missouri and across the nation,”
said Senator Blunt.
“This bill will ensure federal employees can deploy with their fellow Urban Search and Rescue team members when disaster strikes. These first responders are an incredible asset during an emergency, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.”
“During my time as Governor of Florida, my state experienced a number of devastating hurricanes that required quick action on the local, state and federal levels,”
said Senator Scott.
“Search and rescue teams are a critical component of disaster recovery, and I’m proud to co-sponsor the National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act, which will give federal employees the ability to provide lifesaving help during times of crisis.”
“Federal employees who wish to participate in a search and rescue task force after a disaster should be permitted to do so,”
Senator Hassan said.
“Our bipartisan bill would make clear that FEMA may allow federal workers to participate in rescue efforts on the ground as they had been for years. I look forward to working with Senator Hawley to pass this commonsense, bipartisan bill that will provide FEMA access to more volunteers so that they can rescue survivors of disasters more quickly.”
Background
The National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act is the Senate companion to Rep. Vicky Hartzler’s National Urban Search and Rescue Parity Act, which
r
ecently passed
the House of Representatives.
The 2016
National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act
ensured that non-federal employees participating in Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) task forces are provided certain federal protections from risks such as liability, personal injury, illness, disability, or death. Federal employees participating in US&R task forces do not require these explicit protections, because they are protected elsewhere in U.S. Code due to their full-time employment with the federal government.
Unfortunately, FEMA interpreted the new law to mean that federal workers are prohibited from participating in task forces. This is affecting US&R members across the country who are now prohibited from deploying to save lives.

Title: Sen. Hawley Introduces Bill to Stop the Chinese Military’s Acquisition of Sensitive American Technology
Date: Tuesday, May 14, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley introduced the
China Technology Transfer Control Act of 2019
to stop the Chinese military’s acquisition of sensitive American technology and formally admonish China for its predatory trade practices.
In recent years, China has aggressively acquired sensitive U.S. technology through intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. Once China has the technology, it invariably finds its way to the Chinese military.
“It’s time to acknowledge that China acts more like an adversary than a friend,” said Senator Hawley. “For too long, China has exploited American innovation to undermine our values and threaten our security. This legislation is an important step toward keeping American technology out of the hands of the Chinese government and its military.”
Senator Josh Hawley
Background
In recent years, China has aggressively acquired sensitive U.S. technology to advance its military capabilities through intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. China seeks to surpass the U.S. in high tech manufacturing through its state-sponsored “Made in China 2025” initiative and has exploited American technology to advance its military capabilities in two major ways:
“Trade-Technology-for-Market:”
The “Trade-Technology-for-Market” policy requires American companies to form joint ventures Chinese state-owned partners and share strategic technology in order to gain access to the Chinese market. This strategic technology inevitably finds its way to the Chinese military.
A prominent
example
of this is Google attempting to gain access to the Chinese market by building a censored search engine in partnership with a Chinese company.
Working around U.S. laws designed to confront China’s military buildup:
China has worked to find and exploit loopholes in American laws designed to protect sensitive American technology from falling into the hands of the Chinese military.
A prominent
example
of this is a Chinese state-controlled entity renting bandwidth on American satellites that it would be forbidden from purchasing under U.S. law. These satellites could be used to aid China in a military conflict.
The China Technology Transfer Control Act of 2019:
Formally admonishes China for intellectual property theft and manipulation of lawful transfer and uses of technology in ways that directly support its military objectives and threaten the United States.
Places all “core technologies” from China’s “Made in China 2025” strategy on the Department of Commerce’s Export Control List.
Once a technology is placed on the Export Control List, companies must obtain licenses to export that technology to China.
“Core technologies” include nearly 15 different technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, semiconductors, advanced construction equipment and lithium battery manufacturing.
Imposes sanctions on foreign entities and individuals that violate these export controls through transfer of these “core technologies” to China.

Title: Senator Hawley pens new letter to Mark Zuckerberg questioning “privacy-first future” of Facebook
Date: Tuesday, May 14, 2019

Content:
As first reported by
Politico, Senator Hawley
sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
today, questioning the company’s pivot to privacy. Here’s just a snippet:
In a
letter to Zuckerberg, Hawley (R-Mo.) said he fears the CEO’s
recent manifesto
— in which he outlined a “privacy-focused” vision for the company focused on encrypted communications and ephemeral messages — was merely an effort to “to capture and subvert the privacy revolution that threatens your business model and claim an empty public relations victory.”
“You claim your goal is to limit Facebook’s window into users’ lives, but your future profits demand that you expand that window,” Hawley wrote. “The American people deserve to know how you plan to do that before they sign on to your new vision of supposedly private social engagement.”
Read the full letter
here
or below:
—
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:
I wish I could congratulate you on the launch of the latest version of the Facebook platform. But in the same week that you told the world that this time, finally, you are serious about a privacy-first future for Facebook, you were also letting your investors know that you expect to pay the largest fine ever in the United States for falsely pretending to be a company that cares about privacy.
In your F8 speech, you promised to shift Facebook from a “town square” platform into one focused on encrypted messages between smaller groups. But we both know that your business model is monetizing private data, not promoting privacy. And we both know that platforms that tout encrypted messaging can still engage in unscrupulous data harvesting.
While I hope that you and your platform can play a role in building the privacy-first future, I worry that your recent announcements indicate a different intention. To be blunt, I fear that your new platform’s aim is to capture and subvert the privacy revolution that threatens your business model and claim an empty public relations victory. You claim your goal is to limit Facebook’s window into users’ lives, but your future profits demand that you expand that window.
The American people deserve to know how you plan to do that before they sign on to your new vision of supposedly private social engagement.
Messaging Privacy
At your F8 keynote, you promoted your vision of a “privacy focused social platform” with “private interactions” featuring end-to-end encryption. Yet this raises the question of how you can possibly monetize an encrypted platform. News reports suggest that this question has long been a source of frustration for your executive team, contributing to the departures of the founders of WhatsApp from Facebook.
As you have observed, privacy-oriented consumers are shifting from open and monetizable data sharing on unencrypted platforms like yours to encrypted private messaging apps. These kinds of apps, like iMessage and Signal, are distinct from Facebook Messenger in a central respect: they are not connected to a broader ad-based social network infrastructure. Whatever metadata they collect is not fed into a broader platform aimed at the erosion of user privacy for profit.
Encrypted messaging on Facebook, presumably, would be another matter. If you succeed in capturing the encrypted messaging market, I fear that the net effect would be erosion rather than expansion of user privacy. A dominant Facebook messenger could mean a transfer of information about users’ most sensitive contact lists – the people to whom users are closest and in whom they confide their deepest secrets, as well as the dates and times of those interactions – from platforms with no interest in monetizing such information to a platform whose business model relies on such data exploitation.
Moreover, as you well know, data related to messaging is not limited to the text of messages. Facebook knows when its users are interfacing with its messaging products, and it knows through browser cookies and integration with publisher websites when users have clicked links to read articles. What features you offer to allow erasure of “off platform” web activity are off by default – a strange design decision for a privacy-focused platform. In combination, these data sources might tell Facebook when its users share links clicked by others through its encrypted messaging platform and which links receive the most traffic through the messaging platform, therefore enabling Facebook to extrapolate the content of users’ conversations and add such insights to users’ advertising profiles. A digital living room that transmits information to those outside it about which people discuss which subjects with each other within it is not a living room; it’s a human aquarium.
What metadata will Facebook maintain related to user messaging interactions, and for how long? How will it use such data? Will such data supplement other data in user profiles to enhance ad targeting?
Will Facebook make any attempt to determine, by comparing such metadata with other data sources, anything about the content of users’ conversations, such as which articles Facebook users have likely shared with each other via encrypted messenger?
Will it commit to establishing a firewall between data related to user messaging, including metadata related to links shared through the platform, and the rest of its data infrastructure?
If not, will Facebook cooperate with inquiries by Congress and the FTC regarding whether its public representations about this messaging platform are misinforming consumers?
Commerce and Payments
One form of monetization your company provides is advertising that places advertisers into direct, soon-to-be encrypted chats on the messaging platform. Such a monetization scheme complements your stated intent to expand Facebook’s role in the payment ecosystem, including through direct payments within the messaging platform.
Both this approach to connecting ads to your ostensibly privacy-protective messaging platform and your focus on payments raise only further questions about privacy within the messaging platform. A payment system operated by Facebook as an intermediary within an encrypted messaging app is a potential vector for the transmission of sensitive information outside of the supposedly private ecosystem. Facebook touts the privacy and encryption of payment information related to credit cards, and I hope that this encryption will protect users from the leakage of any personal information relating to payments into Facebook’s user profiles. Whether it will depends on what, exactly, is encrypted.
Facebook’s knowledge of which businesses interact with which users and the conversion of advertisements into encrypted chats between users and advertisers is, itself, sensitive information even in the absence of information transmitted through the content of the encrypted messages occurring within an app. If Facebook knows which businesses its users choose to communicate with through encrypted private messaging and whether such communications are initiated through ads on its non-private platform, it can extrapolate from such conversations information about user preferences that users presume to be private due to Facebook’s public presentation of its encrypted chat as a private online space. If Facebook has any knowledge of user transactions thanks to its control of the payment architecture, such extrapolation may be even more precise.
More troublingly, Facebook’s effort to gain a share of the market for online payments may threaten to undermine the privacy of encrypted conversations between friends and their acquaintances. Users of other payment platforms use those mechanisms for some of their most sensitive interactions, from rent payments to ride sharing to shared costs for meals. A Facebook that knows which users transact with each other in these ways need not know the precise content of encrypted communication to determine sensitive details of users’ lives – details it can further feed into its advertising infrastructure.
What metadata will Facebook collect and retain relating to commercial interactions through its messaging platform and payments more generally? How does Facebook define “non-public personal financial information,” and does such information include the names of participants in payment transactions? What metadata categories are excluded from this definition?
How will data and metadata relating to commercial and other payment interactions – including data relating to the origin and conclusion of encrypted private chats with advertisers or Facebook contacts as well as data on payments occurring within such chats – be used by Facebook?
Will such data inform Facebook’s advertising and other data-based personalization algorithms?
What commitments will Facebook make to wall off such data from the rest of its data collection and advertising algorithms to ensure user confidence in the ostensible privacy of its private messaging platform? Will any such data be exempted from such commitments?
Groups and Events
In your F8 presentation, you emphasized a shift from the Facebook news feed to groups. You presented this shift in the context of a presentation emphasizing the value to users of private, secure spaces for more valuable and sensitive interactions.
The need for such spaces and the security you promise on your platform has become more apparent in recent months as we have learned more about Facebook’s failure to protect sensitive information communicated through its existing group features. Last year, Facebook succumbed to public pressure to close loopholes in its closed group feature allowing membership lists for groups organized around sensitive interests such as shared genetic predisposition to cancer to be downloaded by non-members. At the time, such groups’ only recourse was to classify as “secret,” a remedy that would render them inaccessible by search and therefore limit users’ ability to connect over sensitive shared interests.
Additionally, advertisers have long hoped to increase their ability to target such groups. As recently as this year, before the F8 announcement, industry observers have noted the presence of new options for Facebook advertisers to target such groups, suggesting imminent product changes. Such changes presumably relate to Facebook’s greater emphasis on groups relative to the news feed.
Further questions remain about the extent to which Facebook plans to collect and utilize data about those groups, such as group membership, as well as more sensitive data shared within groups to target ads to members within group pages, or to supplement publicly shared information in users’ advertising profiles.
Unacknowledged in your presentation is that the very logic that has informed your shift from the news feed to groups is the value of more personalized and private spaces. Users already assume such spaces, given their relative intimacy, provide them safer spaces in which to share sensitive information, even if they are not formally classified as “private messages.” The principles that have led to your decision to encrypt private messages necessarily suggest that users of groups – certainly of closed or secret groups – deserve the same protections afforded to users of private messenger. Yet Facebook’s suggestion that it will monitor the interactions in such groups for misinformation – just as it does in the public news feed – suggests it takes a different view of these interactions than it hopes its likely users will.
Will encryption be available for private messages between more than two participants?
Will Facebook commit to apply the same data encryption protocols used in private messenger to Facebook groups?
Will it make any privacy-protective distinctions with respect to its own data collection for user profiling and advertisement between data shared in open groups and data shared in closed and secret groups?
Will it allow advertisement targeted to groups, and will the advertising allowed differ between different categories of groups?
Will data compiled through content shared in groups – especially closed or secret groups – be added to the user profiles compiled to target ads to users throughout the platform?
If Facebook fails to make such guarantees, will it make clear to users of groups – including groups organized around sensitive, personal subjects – that it regards their interactions in such groups as analogous to interactions in its news feed “digital public square”? Or will it muddy the waters between the supposedly private spaces within its platform and the public ones?
Changes to the Platform and Effect on Publishers
I would be remiss not to address a subject unrelated to the privacy concerns heretofore raised.
The changes Facebook announced recently will have a substantial effect on the flow of digital information. I hope those changes are for the good. Only time will tell. But already we know with certainty that these changes will be disruptive.
As a major online content platform, Facebook holds the fate of America’s news publishers in its hands. It has not proven itself a worthy custodian. Publishers have in recent years been victimized by capricious changes to Facebook’s algorithm, such as its “pivot to video,” which prompted massive shifts in the media industry’s productive capacity toward the development of video content at the expense of shoe-leather reporting. Such sudden shifts have led to the collapse of local newspapers and major digital news startups alike.
I hope that in planning these announced changes your platform has accounted for the possibility of its impact on media stakeholders. I fear that you have not – and that newsrooms across the country are already reeling from the launch of your new mobile product.
What steps have you taken in recent months to prepare publishers dependent on your platform for the announcements made at F8? If you have not taken such steps, why not?
Your platform has earned immense power. It is unclear that you or your management team deserve the weighty responsibilities that come with it. I wish you the best if your intentions are as you suggest: to promote healthier, safer, more private interactions that enrich all our lives and improve the health of our civic culture. But you long ago lost the benefit of the doubt.
The burden to illustrate that Facebook’s products and the changes you announced recently will in time make a positive contribution to American life is on you. The burden to protect the American people from forces parasitic on our national life and on our economy is on me and my colleagues. I take my responsibilities seriously. I hope you do the same for yours. If you do not, you should anticipate policy changes in the years to come to force behavior change on the part of your senior managers, including legislation holding you and your colleagues personally liable for conduct whose consequences currently fall on Facebook’s shareholders.
I have copied WhatsApp cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum on this message. I suspect their insights about Facebook’s approach to privacy and data monetization would be of special interest to the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, as well as to the public.
I would appreciate a response to this letter by May 27.
Sincerely:
Josh Hawley

Title: ICYMI: Martha MacCallum and Geraldo Rivera on “creepy” Facebook
Date: Tuesday, May 14, 2019

Content:
Last night on “The Story with Martha MacCallum,” Martha and guest Geraldo Rivera discussed the “creepiness” of big tech’s data collection and the addiction it has caused within society. In the clip, Martha mentions her recent conversation with Senator Hawley on these issues:
Transcript:
MacCallum:
Besides all the data harvesting, there’s the dangerous side of the addictive nature of all of this. And I was talking to Senator Josh Hawley the other day, who wrote a piece on this, and he said that it bothers him that some of the greatest minds in technology created, you know, got together, and this is what they did to us. They created social media in our era.
He said, you know, think about landing on the moon, think about the great innovations that American minds have brought to the world. And our moment created this beast that we have to deal with now.
Rivera:
I have this image – you know I’m a father of five – I have this image of my kids like drowning in that thing. Their whole faces getting in. Or you know looking at a picture of a butterfly when there’s a real butterfly flying around, and they’re going to miss the reality of it.
I just think that they are profit-driven. They should be regulated like utilities are regulated. I’m a free enterpriser. But I just don’t trust when something gets this big – when it’s 2.4 billion people, and they own WhatsApp, and they own Instagram, and a half a dozen or a dozen other companies. They will know everything about you, every argument you ever had. I have this vision of them snooping on every room in my house. You know, they’re very creepy to me.
MacCallum:
There’s a big trade-off. Whatever you’re getting out of it, you’re giving up a whole lot to get it.

Title: ICYMI: Kansas City Police Chief applauds Senator Hawley’s bill to prevent officer suicide
Date: Monday, May 13, 2019

Content:
Hawley-sponsored bill would give police tools to care for officers’ mental health
Kansas City Star
By Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith
May 11, 2019
The Kansas City Police Department detective who took his own life in February was the fourth member of our department to do so in as many years. His suicide was the first we discussed publicly because we decided as a department that it was time that we face this issue head on.
We must stop treating police suicides like isolated incidents. More officers died by suicide in 2018 than in the line of duty.
The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression for police and firefighters is five times higher than the general population, according to research from the Ruderman Family Foundation. Yet only 10% of police departments have a suicide prevention program, according to the law enforcement website PoliceOne.com.
…
We need a dedicated mental health professional on staff. We need a psychiatrist who understands what first responders face, has expertise in treating them and can devote all of his or her professional time to the mental health care of the members of our department…
We do not have a place for a psychiatrist in our budget, unfortunately. That is why I was excited to see a bill sponsored by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley: the Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019. This legislation would grant up to $7 million for state and local law enforcement agencies to offer counseling to law enforcement officers and their families, among other things. Other permitted uses for the funds would include evidence-based suicide-prevention programs, specialized training for mental health and suicide prevention, and related support services.
…
There are KCPD detectives who investigate child pornography on a daily basis. Others listen to children who recount experiences of horrific abuse. Patrol officers and accident investigators come upon grizzly crash scenes. They must see the bodies of toddlers who were shot and killed playing with a firearm. They see devastated families regularly. They frequently encounter people who want to hurt or kill them.
Then these officers go home to their own spouses and children and try to act like none of that affected them. It’s a heavy burden, and it’s one we hope to ease with the help of a department psychiatrist.
The Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act would provide the mechanism to make that happen.
This is National Police Week, a time when the nation reflects upon the deadly sacrifices some officers have made while honoring the service of all law enforcement. We love hearing people say “thank you for your service,” but urging lawmakers to support this legislation would put those words into action.

Title: Senators Hawley, Blunt Cosponsor National Police Week Resolution
Date: Monday, May 13, 2019

Content:
Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt of Missouri joined Senate colleagues in cosponsoring a
resolution
declaring May 12th through 18th National Police Week.
The resolution is in remembrance of the 159 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty across the country last year, including FBI Special Agent Melissa Morrow, Officer Christopher R. Morton of the Clinton Police Department, Deputy Aaron P. Roberts of the Greene County Sheriff’s Office and Deputy Casey L. Shoemate of the Miller County Sheriff’s Office.
“While others run away from danger, police officers are the first to run towards it. They have seen horrible crime and tragedy, yet they still put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe,”
Senator Hawley said. “While we can never thank them enough for their service, this week we honor the brave men and women lost in the line of duty and express our gratitude to those who continue to diligently serve and protect our communities.”
“We owe a debt of gratitude to these brave heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice serving our communities and our nation,”
Senator Blunt said. “Every day, law enforcement personnel go to work without knowing what danger they may face. As we mark National Police Week, we honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty and show our gratitude to the selfless men and women who keep our communities safe.”

Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Unanimously Passes Senator Hawley’s Police Suicide Prevention Legislation
Date: Thursday, May 09, 2019

Content:
Today the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) bipartisan
Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019. Introduced with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the legislation is aimed at addressing a major crisis within the
law enforcement community
: officer suicide.
Suicide is the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers—more than homicides and traffic accidents combined. According to the nonprofit Blue H.E.L.P., there were 165 confirmed officer suicides in 2018, including four in Missouri. Just three months ago, tragedy struck in Kansas City when a 10-year veteran of the Kansas City Police Department took his own life.
Senator Hawley’s legislation restores expired grant funding for law enforcement support services. The legislation also allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers. The legislation now moves to the floor for the full Senate to consider the bill.
Ahead of the committee vote, Senator Hawley discussed the importance of the legislation. A video of his remarks and transcript are below:
This coming week is National Police Week, where we have the chance to honor the men and women who put on the uniform and serve our communities of law enforcement.
These are the heroes of our small towns and of our big cities. Every day they face emergencies and tragedies. And they sign up to confront the worst of humanity, and comfort the victims of unspeakable crimes.
These officers do their best to help everybody else, but for many, that means taking those burdens onto themselves, sometimes with tragic consequences.
Suicide is now the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers—more than homicides, more than traffic accidents, and more than those two things combined. According to the nonprofit Blue H.E.L.P., there were 165 confirmed officer suicides in 2018, including four in my home state of Missouri.
2019, I’m sorry to say, is on pace to be an even worse year.
This tragedy happened again in Missouri just three months ago, when a 10-year veteran of the Kansas City Police Department took his own life.
We must do more to stop this epidemic of law enforcement suicides.
So, working with Senator Whitehouse and with law enforcement groups, in April, we introduced the Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act.
This bill will provide local police and sheriff departments with critical resources to prevent officer suicides and promote mental health.
It will help departments hire counselors for officers in distress, set up 24-hour crisis hotlines, assist families, and fund evidence-based programs to help officers get life-saving treatment before it’s too late.
These resources will make an enormous difference in departments that face limited funding and budget shortfalls, often at the cost of our officers’ well-being.
And it’s my belief that this legislation will save lives.
I want to thank Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein, as well as your staffs, for working with my office to bring this bill before the committee today.
And I want to say a special thanks to Senator Whitehouse and his staff for partnering with me and my office to introduce this legislation. Like me, the Senator was the was the chief law enforcement officer of his state of Rhode Island, and he understands the service that our law enforcement render.
I want to thank all the bill’s 18 other cosponsors, including a bipartisan majority of this committee: Senators Grassley, Feinstein, Cornyn, Leahy, Tillis, Durbin, Blackburn, Klobuchar, Coons, Blumenthal, and Hirono.
Finally, I’d like to thank the law enforcement and mental health advocacy groups who have endorsed the bill, and with permission, Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the record letters supporting this legislation from: The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the National Sheriffs’ Association, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Fraternal Order of Police, the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
With this committee vote today, we are a step closer to passing this bill into law and giving the men and women of law enforcement the support and the treatment that they deserve.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Title: Senators Hawley, Markey, Blumenthal, Durbin Call for FTC Investigation into Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition
Date: Thursday, May 09, 2019

Content:
In a bipartisan effort, Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) sent a letter today calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate new evidence of Amazon violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) with its Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition, a digital assistant targeted to children. The device captures the voice recordings of the children who speak to it, and subsequently collects vast amounts of their personal information.
The Senators’ letter highlights evidence that Amazon’s product does not meet COPPA’s notice standard, fails to comply with the Act’s parental consent requirement, and does not effectively allow parents to delete their children’s private information.
“Voice recognition technology and artificial intelligence tools such as the Echo Dot Kids Edition have the potential to enrich and educate kids, including through music and storytelling. But these devices also present significant privacy concerns,”
write the Senators in the letter to all five FTC Commissioners.
“Children are a uniquely vulnerable population. We urge the Commission to take all necessary steps to ensure their privacy as ‘Internet of Things’ devices targeting young consumers come to market, including promptly initiating an investigation into the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition’s compliance with COPPA.”
A copy of the Senators’ letter can be found
here.
COPPA is the current law that covers children age 12 and younger and requires operators of commercial websites and online services directed to children 12 and younger to abide by various privacy safeguards as they collect, use, or disclose personal information about kids. Last updated in 1998,
Senators Hawley and Markey have introduced new legislation
to improve and update this child privacy law for the 21st century.

Title: Senator Hawley to Introduce Legislation Banning Manipulative Video Game Features Aimed at Children
Date: Wednesday, May 08, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley, a
fierce critic of social media practices that prey on the addiction of users, announced today that he will
introduce landmark legislation
banning the exploitation of children through “pay-to-win” and “loot box” monetization practices by the video game industry.
Senator Hawley said, “Social media and video games prey on user addiction, siphoning our kids’ attention from the real world and extracting profits from fostering compulsive habits. No matter this business model’s advantages to the tech industry, one thing is clear: there is no excuse for exploiting children through such practices.
“When a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn’t be allowed to monetize addiction. And when kids play games designed for adults, they should be walled off from compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.”
Background
In recent years, the video game industry has become increasingly reliant on monetization models that promote compulsive “microtransaction” purchases by consumers.
The most abusive such practices are:
Pay to win:
Pay-to-win games take two forms. In some cases, designers engineer games with artificial difficulty curves to induce players to spend money on upgrades simply to progress. These games are often offered for free, enticing players to download and even offering them a false sense of progression upon initial download before artificially increasing difficulty to induce compulsive purchases. In other cases, designers create multiplayer games offering players who purchase paid upgrades competitive advantages over other players.
Loot boxes:
Loot boxes, incorporated both in free and paid games, offer players randomized rewards for spending money, combining the addictive properties of pay-to-win with the compulsive behavior inherent in other forms of gambling.
One notorious example of this practice:
Candy Crush, a free puzzle game featuring a Candy Land style cartoon aesthetic that offers players additional lives on a set timer, allows players to purchase a $149.99 “Luscious Bundle” including 1000 units of its “gold bar” in-game currency, a variety pack of temporary “boosters” to reduce game difficulty, and 24 hours of unlimited lives. The game touts this offering with a medal labeled “Best Value.” Candy Crush Developer King earns parent company Activision Blizzard $2 billion annually, boasting 268 million monthly active users.

Title: Cotton, Hawley, Colleagues Introduce Resolution Marking Iran Deal Withdrawal Anniversary
Date: Wednesday, May 08, 2019

Content:
Earlier today, Senators Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Todd Young (R-Indiana), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), and Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) introduced a resolution to mark the anniversary of the United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. The resolution highlights the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear agreement, reaffirms Congressional opposition to Iran ever acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, and rejects the reapplication of JCPOA sanctions relief. The full text of the resolution may be found
here.
“Today marks one year since the United States withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and imposed a maximum pressure campaign against the regime. Now, Iran is threatening to stockpile and resume enrichment of uranium unless we relent and bail out its dying economy. I hope Iran’s threats serve as a wakeup call for our European allies and partners, as well as members of the business community. Any attempt to invest in the Iranian market, under any circumstances other than Iran’s complete and verifiable cessation of its full range of malign activities, will be fraught with huge legal and financial risks. Businesses should not put themselves in that compromising position, and our European partners should not give in to Iran’s high-stakes nuclear blackmail,”
said Cotton.
“The Iran nuclear deal was one of the single worst foreign policy disasters in recent memory. It severely threatened our closest allies and rewarded our worst adversaries by giving them a fast track toward acquiring nuclear weapons,”
said Hawley. “I support the Administration’s maximum pressure campaign to hold Iran accountable for its sponsorship of terrorism, human rights abuses and leading role in the proliferation of chemical weapons.”
“Iran’s ongoing nuclear misbehavior underscores why the United States was absolutely right to withdraw from the flawed deal. The people of Iran deserve better as they continue to suffer under the Iranian regime’s criminal corruption, massive economic mismanagement and systemic human rights abuses, in addition to its support for terrorists and the murderous Assad regime, ballistic missile aggression, and nuclear misbehavior,”
said Rubio.
“The Obama Iran nuclear deal was a catastrophe for the national security of the United States and our allies,”
said Cruz. “It legalized Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and was designed to fully expire and lift restrictions on Iran in the next few years. In the face of enormous amount of opposition, President Trump made the right call by terminating U.S. participation in the deal and imposing pressure on the Ayatollahs. Now there should be a consensus that there’s no reason to re-enter a deal that will be winding down anyway.”
“President Trump made a courageous decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, which builds off his success of rooting out ISIS and keeping our country safe from the threat of global terrorism,”
said Braun.
“Today, on the one year anniversary of America’s withdrawal from the flawed JCPOA, I am glad to join my colleagues in reaffirming this decision. As a nation, we should reject any sanctions relief that would allow the Iranian regime to continue its malign activities – and allied countries and businesses should do the same,”
said Blackburn.
“An emboldened Iran is a threat to the world, and the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal did nothing but strengthen this State Sponsor of Terrorism while endangering Israel and our Middle East allies. I agree with President Trump’s decision and firmly stand with his administration as the United States works to eliminate Iran’s ability to finance terrorism,”
said Cramer.
“A year ago, the United States rightly walked away from a terrible nuclear deal with Iran, the largest state-sponsor of terror. Today, as they saber-rattle and threaten to restart their uranium enrichment program, Iran’s despots are making it clear that they’re still hell-bent on destabilizing the Middle East and threatening American interests. The United States and our allies must continue our maximum-pressure campaign,”
said Sasse.

Title: Sens. Hawley And Blumenthal Call on FTC to Implement “Forceful Accountability Measures” Against Facebook
Date: Monday, May 06, 2019

Content:
Following reports that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is negotiating penalties for Facebook’s breach of its consent order, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons to urge the FTC “to act swiftly to conclude its investigation of Facebook and to move to compel sweeping changes to end the social network’s pattern of misuse and abuse of personal data.”
The senators called on the FTC to “pursue deterrent monetary penalties and impose forceful accountability measures on Facebook, including limits on the use of consumer data, managerial responsibility for violations, and other structural remedies to stop further breaches of consumer trust.”
Referring to Facebook’s financial earnings statements in which the social network giant set aside up to $5 billion for a potential fine, the senators urged the FTC to go further than a one-time fine, writing that the “rumored number is a bargain for Facebook,” and “even a fine in the billions is simply a write-down for the company.” Instead, Blumenthal and Hawley urged the FTC to “impose long-term limits on Facebook’s collection and use of personal information.”
The Senators also asked the FTC to hold any Facebook employees – including Mark Zuckerberg – who knowingly broke the law personally responsible, writing, “the FTC considered naming Mark Zuckerberg in its previous consent order but ultimately declined to do so. If the FTC finds that any Facebook executive knowingly broke the consent order or violated the law, it must name them in any further action.”
The full text of the letter is copied below and
available here.
May 6, 2019
The Honorable Joseph Simons
Chairman
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Simons:
We write to urge the Commission to act swiftly to conclude its investigation of Facebook, and to move to compel sweeping changes to end the social network’s pattern of misuse and abuse of personal data. This investigation has been long delayed in conclusion – raising the specter of a remedy that is too little too late. The Facebook consent decree violations have been blatant and brazen, an offensive defiance that adds insult to injury. The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable. The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth. The Commission should pursue deterrent monetary penalties and impose forceful accountability measures on Facebook, including limits on the use of consumer data, managerial responsibility for violations, and other structural remedies to stop further breaches of consumer trust.
According to its most recent financial earnings statement, Facebook has estimated that the FTC’s investigation will cost the company between $3 billion to $5 billion.
1
While the reported penalty exceeds previous privacy cases, the scope and nature of the allegations are also unprecedented. The Cambridge Analytica incident that initially prompted the investigation affected the personal data of more than 70.6 million Americans, and Facebook still has not fully accounted for similar misuse by other third party applications.
2
This also does not consider further issues that the FTC may find in its investigation, such as recent reports that Facebook harvested address books from email accounts without user consent.
3
In the same quarter it reported the FTC fine, Facebook recorded $15 billion in revenue, beating market expectations. Considering the maximum civil penalty amount of $42,530 per violation, the rumored number is a bargain for Facebook. Even a fine in the billions is simply a write-down for the company, and large penalties have done little to deter large tech firms.
4
If the FTC is seen as traffic police handing out speeding tickets to companies profiting off breaking the law, then Facebook and others will continue to push the boundaries.
Fines alone are insufficient. Far-reaching reforms must finally hold Facebook accountable to consumers. We are deeply concerned that one-time penalties of any size every few years are woefully inadequate to effectively restrain Facebook. The FTC should impose long-term limits on Facebook’s collection and use of personal information. It should consider setting rules of the road on what Facebook can do with consumers’ private information, such as requiring the deletion of tracking data, restricting the collection of certain types of information, curbing advertising practices, and imposing a firewall on sharing private data between different products, including Facebook’s ad platform.
As important as remedies on Facebook as a company are, the FTC should impose tough accountability measures and penalties for individual executives and management responsible for violations of the consent order and for privacy failures. Personal responsibility must be recognized from the top of the corporate board down to the product development teams. For decades, the FTC has understood that some violations require naming specific executives in its consent orders, particular those that “formulates, directs, or controls the policies, acts, or practices” that break the law.
5
According to the Washington Post, the FTC considered naming Mark Zuckerberg in its previous consent order but ultimately declined to do so.
6
If the FTC finds that any Facebook executive knowingly broke the consent order or violated the law, it must name them in any further action.
It is also time for the FTC to learn from a history of broken and under-enforced consent orders. The FTC has an opportunity to establish a new set of requirements for consent orders that target data privacy cases and provide enduring safeguards for consumers. Such measures could include the direct appointment and oversight of auditors by the FTC, strict board or managerial liability for assessments and compliance, restriction on data practices or collection, and public disclosure of audits.
The Facebook investigation will be a defining moment for the Commission. It must be seen as a strong protector of consumer privacy and begin to set out a new era of enforcement, or it will not be taken as a credible enforcer. Action is overdue.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Title: Senator Hawley’s Hoover Institution speech raises the stakes in the big tech debate
Date: Friday, May 03, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley delivered a provocative speech yesterday raising the stakes of the debates over big tech and expanding the scope of the discussion beyond privacy and free speech, questioning whether social media actually provides any real value to the American economy and American society. He likened the social media business model – “attention arbitrage” – to financial arbitrage, accused social media investors of investing in users’ addiction to social platforms, and raised concerns that the industry draws talent and capital from productive sectors while driving depression among users.
Selected Excerpts:
“One of the most difficult things about acting in this area is the fear that any significant change in this space, any significant adjustment to the rules of the road, whether it be privacy requirements or content requirements, might end up stifling Silicon Valley, which we are accustomed to regarding — certainly we’re told — is the great Crown Jewel of the American economy.
But is it?”
“Is this really the best that our best minds have to offer?”
“The evidence is more and more strongly suggesting that there is something that is deeply troubling, maybe even deeply wrong, with the entire social media economy, that
it does not represent a source of strength for America’s tomorrow but is rather a source of peril.
“Consider for a moment the basic business model of the dominant social media platforms. You’re familiar with them.
You might think of it as akin to financial arbitrage. Maybe we’ll call it attention arbitrage.
Users’ attention is bought by the tech giants and then immediately sold to advertisers, for the highest price of course.”
“Now, arbitrage opportunities, as those of you familiar with markets know, are supposed to close, right? The market eventually determines something is off.
How is it that this attention arbitrage in the social media market is preserved
and renewed over and over again? And that’s where things get really scary, because
it’s preserved by hijacking users’ neural circuitry to prevent rational decision making about what to click and how to spend time. Or, just to simplify that a little bit, it’s preserved through addiction.
Social media only works as a business model if it consumes users’ time and attention day after day after day. It needs to replace the various activities we did perfectly well without social media, for the entire known history of the human race with itself. It needs to replace those activities with time spent on social media. So that addiction is actually the point. That’s what social media shareholders are investing in. They are investing in the addiction of users.”
“And I think that social media users actually understand this intuitively even if they would put it differently.You don’t log on to Facebook to connect with a friend…
You log on to Facebook to be on Facebook.
The attention arbitrage market itself becomes the destination.”
“Day after day seems brings fresh data, fresh reports, fresh studies detailing the significant social consequences of social media use in such large quantities. Today’s Washington Post, for instance, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, has a chilling story about the rash of teenage suicide especially in younger teenagers. . . It’s not just an uptick, it’s a surge in teenage suicide, particularly among younger teenagers, [that] coincides eerily with the introduction of the iPhone particularly in its later models where the social media platforms and the social media apps were readily available and optimized for use. . .
Many studies now suggest that the time spent on social media and on social media platforms at least correlates to some degree with increased depression, loneliness. All of these social consequences, these are significant, you might even say that they are severe, and the question we need to be asking is what is the role of social media in driving them, in encouraging them, in promoting them, and is this really something that is good for our society in the long term, or for our economy for that matter?”
“This is what some of our brightest minds have been doing with their time for years now. Designing these platforms, designing apps that integrate with them.
I mean, what else might they have been doing? Just think about it. What else might these bright minds, these talented women and men have been doing that might’ve been truly productive for the American economy and for American consumers? We’ve encouraged an entire generation of our bright engineers in a discipline that provides a little or no productive value to the United States economy, sucking them from communities that need their talents out to outposts on the coasts, encouraging them to forget the problems of people they left behind, and of course capital then follows them to those places.
These are economic developments that rewards some, there’s no doubt about that, but attention arbitrage like financial arbitrage is no foundation for long-term growth.”
“An economy that does not value the things that matter produces a society that is shaped in its own image.”

Title: Senator Hawley Discusses Support for Bill to End Rape Kit Backlog
Date: Thursday, May 02, 2019

Content:
Today the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the
Debbie Smith Act of 2019, which reauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. The nationwide backlog of untested rape kits is a national scandal with tragic consequences for sexual assault victims. Thousands of rape kits currently sit untested in labs and on police storage shelves across the nation – each one of them holding the potential to solve a crime, imprison a rapist and provide a victim with the justice they deserve. The Debbie Smith Act was first signed into law in 2004 and provides local and state crime laboratories with funding to end the backlog of untested DNA evidence from unsolved crimes, especially rape kits.
Ahead of the vote, Senator Josh Hawley, an original cosponsor of the legislation, discussed the importance of eliminating the backlog of DNA kits. Senator Hawley said, “This legislation is a crucial part of making sure that [rape] kits get tested, that these cases are solved, that perpetrators are prosecuted, and that criminals are finally sent to prison.”
When he was Attorney General of Missouri, Hawley conducted a
statewide audit
of rape kits where he found that the state had more than 5,000 untested kits. The state was then able to secure the necessary federal funding to tackle this backlog and to begin to set up a statewide rape kit tracking system. A
video
of his remarks and transcript are below:
Let me just say a few words if I could about the Debbie Smith Act which I am very proud to cosponsor.
“This is a bill that authorizes crucial grant funding to help state crime labs work through their backlogs of untested DNA samples, including rape kits.
“And as attorney general of Missouri, I had to confront this problem head on. My office conducted the first-ever statewide survey of untested rape kits in Missouri, and we found over 5,000 kits that had not been tested.
“It is completely unacceptable that survivors of this horrendous crime – who voluntarily undergo the often invasive, certainly very difficult, effort of getting a rape kit completed – would then have those kits not tested and not used. And as a consequence, their attackers and perpetrators would go unprosecuted.
“So, fortunately the state of Missouri was able to secure federal funding necessary to tackle this backlog and to begin to set up a statewide rape kit tracking system. And we did this so that survivors would no longer be forced to wait years and years before they get the justice they deserve.
“But too many criminals in many other states continue to walk the streets because of the huge backlog, nationally, of untested DNA rape kits. And this legislation is a crucial part of making sure that those kits get tested, that these cases are solved, that perpetrators are prosecuted, and that criminals are finally sent to prison.
“So, I just want to thank Senator Cornyn for his leadership on this, thank the many colleagues on both sides of the aisle for joining in this fight. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.”

Title: Senator Hawley: Unelected Bureaucrats Tried To Overturn 2016 Election Because They Disdain Trump Voters
Date: Wednesday, May 01, 2019

Content:
Today during Attorney General William Barr’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Josh Hawley said the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump was an attempt by unelected bureaucrats to overturn a democratic election because of their disdain for Trump voters. A video of the remarks and transcript are below:
Senator Hawley:
Speaking of particular individuals who got involved, I have to say, I’ve listened to this testimony all day today, and to me, maybe the most shocking thing I’ve heard is this. The Chairman read it earlier. On August 26, 2016, this is a text message from Peter Strzok, a top counterintelligence investigator who we now know helped launch this counter-spy investigation of the President of the United States.
Peter Strzok says, ‘Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support.’
Smell is capitalized. ‘Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support.’
In my view, do you want to know what’s really going on here? You want to know why the counterintelligence investigation really happened? Do you want to know why we are all sitting here today? That’s why. Right there.
An unelected bureaucrat, an unelected official in this government who clearly has open disdain, if not outright hatred for Trump voters, like the people of my state for instance.
‘I could SMELL the Trump support?’
Then tried to overturn the results of a democratic election. That’s what’s really gone on here. That’s the story. That’s why we are here today.
I cannot believe that a top official of this government with the kind of power that these people had, would try to exercise their own prejudices ­— and that’s what this is; it’s open, blatant prejudice — would try to use that in order to overturn a democratic election. And to my mind, that’s the real crisis here. And it is a crisis. Because if there’s not accountability, if this can go on in the United States of America, well then my goodness gracious we don’t have a democracy anymore.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Bicameral Resolution Condemning Terrorist Attacks in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday
Date: Tuesday, April 30, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Green Bay) introduced a bicameral resolution condemning the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka. The attacks, perpetrated by an Islamist terrorist group with links to ISIS, killed more than 250 people and injured more than 500 others. The resolution calls the bombings an attack on “the basic human liberty of freedom of religion.”
“I am disgusted by the recent string of attacks on people in their places of worship. No one should feel threatened while practicing their faith,” said
Sen. Hawley. “We should condemn the despicable acts of violence in Sri Lanka in the strongest terms possible and call it what it is – radical Islamic terrorism. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and communities grieving the loss of their loved ones on such a holy day for the Christian faith.”
“The Easter attacks against Christians in Sri Lanka must be forcefully condemned,” said
Rep. Gallagher. “Acts of violence against any person of faith, in any country, cannot be tolerated, and demonstrate the need for all of us to unite against extremist ideology. I stand with my colleagues against these heinous acts and offer my deepest condolences to the people of Sri Lanka as they recover.”
Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are original co-sponsors in the Senate. The resolution also calls on the Government of Sri Lanka and all governments to protect and preserve religious liberty.

Title: Sens. Hawley and Blunt Decry Lack of Action on Disaster Aid Bill
Date: Friday, April 12, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) joined a group of colleagues to address Senate Democrats’ efforts to stall disaster relief legislation for emergency flooding in the Midwest.
Earlier this month, Senators Hawley and Blunt voted in
support
of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby’s (R-Ala.) emergency supplemental appropriations legislation, which would have been a step toward making the states devastated by the recent flooding – including Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska – eligible for aid. The bill failed and Democrats prevented similar bills from coming up for a vote this week.
“Although more will be needed in the future, this package would have expedited critical aid for Missourians whose homes, crops, and livestock have been destroyed by catastrophic flooding,” said Senator Josh Hawley. “It’s shameful that Democrats would hold hostage aid to farmers and ranchers in order to settle political scores. This is Washington at its worst.”
“Historic flooding has devastated farms, destroyed homes, and damaged vital infrastructure systems in Missouri,” said Senator Roy Blunt. “I’m disappointed Senate Democrats have stood in the way of getting much-needed resources to flood impacted areas. We need to get this aid package to the president’s desk. With damage assessments still ongoing, we must also be ready to move forward on any additional assistance that will be needed to help communities recover.”
In late March, Sens.
Hawley
and
Blunt
toured flood damage in Northwest Missouri and emphasized the need to get relief to impacted communities. Other members of neighboring states also weighed in on the matter.
“Iowa farmers are under water, literally and financially, due to the floods that have ravaged portions of the state,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). “It is the responsibility of Congress to step up during times of crisis and help out our fellow Americans. But rather than come to the aid of disaster victims in Iowa and throughout the country, congressional Democrats are playing politics. Iowans who need help to put their lives back together will certainly remember this as the same Democrat senators who voted ‘no’ ask for their vote in 2020.”
“Nebraskans are suffering after being hit by blizzards and severe flooding. It’s extremely upsetting that Senate Democrats are holding Nebraska’s relief funds hostage over their demand for additional resources for Puerto Rico, which already has received $41 billion in approved funds,” said Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). “People in my state are traumatized, and we need to get a funding bill that includes Nebraska passed now. I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides to do so.
“The political hackery from Senate Democrats is dumb and it needs to end now,” said Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). “We’re still recovering from the biggest natural disaster in our state’s history. Nebraskans rolled up their sleeves and went to work, but Congress is playing typical partisan politics. This is shameful.”
Republican senators have worked to negotiate in good faith on a bipartisan disaster relief package to provide funding across the continental United States as well as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands for regions that have experienced droughts, flooding, hurricanes, storms, volcanoes, wildfires, and other natural disasters.
Historically, the federal government has stepped in to help victims recovering from natural disasters, and the same action is overdue and badly needed for these affected states. Despite months of negotiations, efforts to advance funding have stalled over
partisan
disagreements.

Title: Senator Hawley Asks Attorney General Barr And Secretary DeVos to Hold Yale Accountable for Targeting Religious Students
Date: Tuesday, April 09, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent letters to Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos this morning asking them to ensure that Yale Law School reverses its
policy
of discriminating against students of faith. Sen. Hawley’s letter comes after Yale Law School announced it would no longer provide loan repayments or stipends to students who choose to work for certain religious organizations, even though the school will continue providing those resources to all other students.
In his letters, Senator Hawley writes, “I request that your Department protect the rights of these students by monitoring closely the changes Yale is making to its policy and by taking all appropriate legal action to strip Yale of federal funding should it—as an institution that is supposed to be neutral about religion—target religious students for special disfavor.”
The letters to Attorney General Barr and Secretary DeVos come after Hawley, a Yale Law School
alumnus, released a
statement
blasting the school’s policy last week.
Full text of the letter to Attorney General Barr can be found below.
April 9, 2019
William P. Barr
Attorney General of the United States
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Yale Law School recently announced a policy targeting religious students for special disfavor. That policy, as first described, blocks students who work for certain faith-based organizations from accessing resources available to all other students. Specifically, the policy prohibits students from receiving school resources if they work for an organization that takes religion into account when hiring. And unlike federal law, the policy fails to include an exception for religious organizations even though federal law recognizes that religious organizations often cannot fulfill their unique missions without considering religion while hiring.
Last Thursday, after receiving negative media attention for targeting religious students, Yale changed its tune and now says that it will craft a new policy that includes an exemption for “religious organizations.”
1
But the circumstances surrounding Yale’s announcement suggest that whatever exception Yale does create may be inadequate. When Yale first announced its policy, it did not do so in a void; it did so in response to student protesters. Those protesters demanded that Yale strip funding from students who work for Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious organization. When announcing its policy, Yale praised those protesters for their “leadership” in raising the issue. And in response to questions about the policy, Yale both declined to include a religious exemption and specifically identified students who work for Alliance Defending Freedom as students the policy targets.
Given this background, there is a real risk that whatever definition of “religious organization” Yale promulgates will be unreasonably narrow, giving the false impression that Yale is protecting religious students while it is in reality capitulating to the demands of student protesters who want to target certain religious classmates for special disfavor.
The policy Yale first announced, if adopted by any public university, would be blatantly unconstitutional because the policy “target[s] the religious for ‘special disabilities’ based on their ‘religious status.’” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2019 (2017). Even though Yale is not a state institution, it is still subject to statutory restrictions because it receives federal funds. And as a law school, Yale is obligated to foster respect for the law. That includes fostering respect for students, their constitutional rights, and their deeply held religious beliefs.
I request that your Department protect the rights of these students by monitoring closely the changes Yale is making to its policy and by taking all appropriate legal action to strip Yale of federal funding should it—as an institution that is supposed to be neutral about religion—target religious students for special disfavor.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Law Enforcement and Suicide Prevention Advocates Applaud Senator Hawley’s Police Suicide Prevention Legislation
Date: Monday, April 08, 2019

Content:
Less than a week after
introduction, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley’s
“Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019”
has received an outpouring of support from the law enforcement and suicide prevention communities. The bill restores expired grant funding for law enforcement family-support services. The bill also allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers.
Today the Major County Sheriffs of America, The National Association of Police Organizations, The National District Attorneys Association, National Sheriffs’ Association and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention released statements in support of the legislation:
“Law enforcement officials are all too familiar with calls for service that repeatedly bring them into contact with people whose mental illnesses are not being adequately addressed and while mental health issues are increasingly important in society, in professions like law enforcement, the strain on families and individual well-being is acutely felt. Drawing more attention to this issue and expanding programs to help those in our profession deal with stress and suicide is long overdue. On behalf of the Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) we are proud to support this bipartisan bill and we applaud Senators Hawley and Whitehouse for their support of our profession and our families.”
–Sheriff Grady Judd (Polk County, Fla.), President, Major County Sheriffs of America
“State and local law enforcement officers are our nation’s first responders. They respond to our country’s greatest tragedies as well as violent and abhorrent crimes that unfortunately occur with some frequency in our neighborhoods. They have seen and experienced horrors that they cannot forget, yet they still put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities. The stresses and strains of the job not only affect officers’ mental and physical wellbeing, but also the wellbeing of their family life. The STOIC Act recognizes the stresses of the job and will help give officers and their families the support and resources they need to address their emotional and mental wellbeing. NAPO thanks Senators Hawley and Whitehouse for their support and leadership on this important issue.”
–Bill Johnson, Executive Director, National Association of Police Organizations
“NDAA thanks Senator Hawley and Senator Whitehouse for prioritizing the well-being of law enforcement officers. All too often, the national discussion surrounding mental health does not include the hard working men and women protecting our communities. The STOIC Act takes important steps to expand family-support grants to assist law enforcement officers suffering from mental health concerns and provides needed funds to guarantee these programs are effective. The nation’s prosecutors look forward to working alongside Congress to ensure this bipartisan legislation becomes law.”
–Jonathan Blodgett, District Attorney for Essex County, Mass., President, National District Attorneys Association
“Sadly we have seen the rise in suicides in our law enforcement profession and we must provide more assistance to our personnel who are struggling with mental health issues. This bill will provide valuable resources to those who are the thin blue line in keeping our communities safe.”
–Jonathan Thompson, Executive Director, National Sheriffs’ Association
“The STOIC Act will provide a greater scope of mental health resources and more support for law enforcement officers and their families. AFSP applauds the inclusion of suicide prevention programs and the increase of funding for much needed mental health resources. This legislation is a strong step towards prioritization of law enforcement mental health and suicide prevention.”
–John H. Madigan, Jr., Senior Vice President, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) is the lead co-sponsor of the bipartisan “Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019.”  Additional co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Tillis (R-N.C.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cotton (R-Ark.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Scott (R-Fla.).

Following
reports
that Yale Law School will now deprive religious students of funding opportunities if they work for organizations that require statements of faith, Senator Josh Hawley issued this statement:
“Yale’s new policy, as first announced, targets religious students for special disfavor. Under this policy, a student saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt can’t access Yale’s loan repayment program if they choose to work for certain faith-based organizations. Depriving a student of resources available to everybody else because of her religion isn’t just wrong. For schools receiving federal funds, it’s illegal. Now Yale has suggested it may abandon or alter this discriminatory policy. If it does not, the federal government should strip funding from Yale under appropriate statutes and review Yale’s tax-exempt status.”

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Improve Duck Boat Safety
Date: Thursday, April 04, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced legislation to
improve the safety of duck boats, following the tragedy on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Mo., last summer that claimed 17 lives. Sen. Hawley’s legislation would authorize previously-outlined National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
recommendations, including commonsense provisions to require the use of life jackets and equipping all operating duck boats to be more buoyant in the case of emergency flooding.
Senator Hawley said, “Missouri still mourns the lives lost on Table Rock Lake last summer. Sadly though, this tragedy wasn’t the first of its kind. For decades now, the NTSB has been making recommendations to make these rides safer, but Congress has failed to act. It’s my goal to change that by introducing this legislation today. We have to protect safety on the water.”
The NTSB made their recommendations three years after a 1999 duck boat tragedy killed 13 in Arkansas. Sen. Hawley’s legislation goes a step further by barring duck boat operation in severe weather conditions. Once enacted, non-compliant duck boats would be prohibited from operating until they meet the necessary requirements outlined in the bill.

Title: Senator Hawley Introduces Legislation to Support Law Enforcement Community, Prevent Officer Suicides
Date: Wednesday, April 03, 2019

Content:
Suicide is the number one cause of death for police officers in the United States. But Congress has failed to fund grant programs that provide support services for police officers and their families. Current grant programs also do not allow for funds to be used for suicide prevention efforts, mental health screenings, or training to identify officers at risk.
Officers need an advocate in Washington, and that’s why today U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) along with Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has introduced the
“
Supporting and Treating Officers In Crisis Act of 2019.”
The bill would restore grant funding for law enforcement family-support services. The bill also allows grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers.
Both Senators Hawley and Whitehouse served as the chief law enforcement officers for their respective states before entering Congress. They issued the following statements upon introduction of this bipartisan legislation:
Senator Hawley
said, “Every day law enforcement demonstrates tremendous bravery in protecting us from the worst of humanity, but it often takes a toll. Police work is physically, mentally, and emotionally demanding. This legislation will provide much-needed support to the heroes that keep us safe.
Senator Whitehouse
said, “The things that police officers and firefighters see at accidents and crime scenes can be horrifying, and they often face terrible danger. Helping them process and deal with the things they must bear to protect the rest of us is an important duty we owe.”
Original co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Tillis (R-N.C.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cotton (R-Ark.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Scott (R-Fla.).
The National Sheriffs’ Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and National District Attorneys Association have endorsed this legislation.

BACKGROUND
Studies and surveys consistently show that law enforcement officers (“LEOs”) have above-average stress levels in their jobs.
[1]
Among the top stressor events that LEOs report facing on a regular basis are:
Dealing with family disputes and crisis situations (83%)
Responding to felonies in progress (80%)
Dealing with insufficient department support for their mission (77%)
Situations requiring the use of force (59%)
Exposure to dead or battered children (27%)
Being physically attacked (23%)
[2]
These differences in stress levels lead to greater adverse outcomes for LEOs than the general population.
One study estimated that between 25% and 30% of police officers have stress-based physical health problems, most notably high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and gastrointestinal disorders.
[3]
Another study of Ohio police officers found that 7% of officers sampled met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[4]
The Centers for Disease Control concluded that the rate of suicides among workers in protective services (law enforcement and firefighting) is 40% higher than the national average.
[5]
In recent years, more LEOs have died from suicide than in the line of duty.
In 2018, 160 LEOs committed suicide, compared to 159 suicides in 2017 and 141 suicides in 2016.
[6]
That is compared to 144 LEOs who died in the line of duty in 2018 from homicides, traffic accidents, and other causes.
[7]
The federal government has failed to fund grant programs for LEO support services in recent years.
While the federal government devotes significant grant resources to improving state and local police effectiveness and initiatives to fight crime, little to none is devoted to providing support services for police officers and their families.
Authorization for the federal government’s grant program for LEO family-support services expired in 2000 (34 U.S.C. § 10261(a)(21)).
The program is also in need of reform, with a greater focus on mental health and suicide prevention (34 U.S.C. §§ 10491–10498).
The bill would address this issue in two ways:
Reform and expand the family-support grant program’s eligible uses to better address the mental-health and support needs of LEOs, especially as it relates to suicide prevention. The bill would specifically allow grant recipients to use funds to establish suicide-prevention programs and to support officers suffering stress and mental-health issues.
Reauthorize appropriations for family-support grants for state and local law enforcement agencies, which lapsed in 2000. The bill would authorize up to $7,500,000 in appropriations each year for fiscal years 2020 to 2024, which is the same level of authorization that the program had in 2000.

Title: Senator Hawley Calls for Third-Party Audit of Twitter
Date: Wednesday, April 03, 2019

Content:
Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey this morning, calling on him to conduct a
third-party audit
of his platform’s suspension policies. Sen. Hawley’s letter was prompted by Twitter’s recent suspension of the account affiliated with the pro-life film, Unplanned, on its opening weekend.
Hawley’s letter notes that Twitter has repeatedly targeted pro-life organizations. He also questions whether Twitter deserves the “sweetheart deal” it receives under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 provides tech companies with immunity from liability for illegal content posted by third parties because they provide “a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.”
In his letter, Senator Hawley writes, “I am rapidly losing confidence that Twitter is committed to the free speech principles that justify immunity under section 230. It is time for Twitter to prove it is truly committed to free speech: conduct a third-party audit and release the results to the public, in full.”
Full text can be found below.
—
April 3, 2019
Jack Dorsey
CEO
Twitter
1355 Market Street, Suite 900
San Francisco, CA 94103
Dear Mr. Dorsey:
Last week, Twitter suspend the account of the pro-life movie Unplanned—on opening weekend, no less—raising yet more questions about your supposed commitment to free speech. Just as bad, after you lifted the suspension, 99 percent of Unplanned’s followers mysteriously disappeared.
In light of these events, and in view of Twitter’s history of de-platforming conservative voices, it is time for Twitter to open itself to a third-party audit of how and when the company enforces its suspension policies.
Those who exercise their First Amendment right to advocate for the inherent worth and dignity of all persons, regardless of size or age, are used to biased treatment from big corporations. But platform companies like Twitter are supposed to rise above that partisan nonsense. In 2018, you told Wired that your “purpose is to serve the public conversation” by “defending freedom of expression as a fundamental human right.” Congress has given you a sweetheart deal—immunity from liability for illegal content posted by third parties—because tech companies like yours promised to provide “a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(3).
Yet your company has repeatedly abused that privilege. You often refuse to allow pro-life organizations to purchase ads because you deem it “inflammatory” when these groups advocate for the right to life, but you allow those on the other side to advocate for late-term abortion—a practice opposed by more than 80 percent of Americans. And when you “fully admit” that Twitter’s “bias … is more left-leaning,” is it any wonder that this kind of political censorship disproportionately harms conservatives?
Given this troubling history, the decision to suspend the account for a pro-life movie on opening weekend is too much to be a coincidence. I am rapidly losing confidence that Twitter is committed to the free speech principles that justify immunity under section 230.
It is time for Twitter to prove it is truly committed to free speech: conduct a third-party audit and release the results to the public, in full.
An internal audit would be inherently biased. Indeed, you admit that your organization has a left-leaning prejudice. The public deserves an audit untainted by self-interest. And free speech requires a platform that is truly open to all viewpoints.
For that reason, it is imperative you open Twitter for an audit by a neutral third-party organization and make the results public. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Senator Hawley Coauthors Bill to Lower Cost of Prescription Drugs
Date: Tuesday, April 02, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) joined Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in introducing the “Transparent Drug Pricing Act of 2019.” The two Senators spoke this morning about their legislation to lower prescription drug prices by promoting greater price transparency, increasing consumer choice, and ensuring Americans pay the same price as consumers in other parts of the world.
Senator Hawley said, “It’s infuriating to watch the big pharma companies abuse American families again and again by charging them outrageous prices for lifesaving medicines. We need to lift the veil of secrecy that surrounds prescription drug pricing. Insurance companies need to be up front about what consumers will pay for prescription drugs and pharmacies need to disclose the lowest price available. It’s common sense.”
Senator Rick Scott said, “American consumers are facing a crisis of rising drug costs and we can’t wait any longer. I urge every Senator to put themselves in the shoes of a family or a senior living on a fixed income who’s seen their drug costs triple in just a few years. This is about the lives of real people that hang in the balance. Every American should know exactly what their prescriptions cost and it’s unfair that consumers in other countries get a better deal than patients in America. That must change. There is no justification for waiting, we need to address the soaring costs of prescription drugs right now. Drug prices are a serious problem – a problem Washington should have addressed long ago.”
Background On The Transparent Drug Pricing Act of 2019:
PRICE TRANSPARENCY
Pharmacies MUST inform patients what it would cost to purchase drugs out-of-pocket instead of using their insurance and co-pay. If patients choose to pay out-of-pocket (which is often cheaper), the total cost would be applied to their deductible. Consumers should not be penalized for shopping for the best price. And they must get this information at the point of sale.
CHOICE
Insurance companies MUST inform patients of the total costs of their prescription drugs 60 days prior to open enrollment. This will allow patients to be consumers and shop around for the best deal. Once those costs are set, they cannot be changed for a full 12 months. This will give patients – particularly seniors living on a fixed income – confidence that their drug costs won’t suddenly increase.
FAIRNESS
Drug companies CANNOT charge American consumers more for prescription drugs than they charge consumers in other industrialized nations like Great Britain, Canada or Germany. There is no reason why U.S. pharmaceutical companies sell drugs to people in foreign countries far cheaper than what they charge Americans.  This provision would sunset after 5 years.

Title: Following Google CEO Meeting with President Trump, Senator Hawley Calls on Google to Publicly Address Its Partnership with China
Date: Thursday, March 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking him to address the company’s refusal to work with the United States Department of Defense while partnering with China on artificial intelligence initiatives.
The letter was sent following Google’s meeting with President Trump to discuss the company’s decision to not work with the Department of Defense while partnering with China.
The meeting with President Trump was sparked by an
exchange
Senator Hawley had – earlier this month at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing – with the Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in which the two defense leaders said that Google’s work in China was providing “direct benefit” to the Chinese military.
In his letter, Senator Hawley writes, “I understand that today you have met with General Dunford and the President of the United States to address these concerns. Now meet with the American people by addressing publicly the work your company does in China, the benefits it may provide to the Chinese government and military, and your reluctance to partner or aid the Armed Forces of the United States.”

Mr. Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer
Google
1600 Ampitheater Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Mr. Pichai, I have been deeply troubled by the testimony of our national defense leadership regarding Google’s unwillingness to partner with the U.S. Armed Forces, even while pursuing lucrative projects in China that directly or indirectly benefit the repressive Chinese government.
At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on March 14, both Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford expressed deep concern about Google’s actions.
In response to my questions, Chairman Dunford testified that Google’s work with Chinese companies in China may directly threaten the United States. As General Dunford further elaborated at an event at the Atlantic Council on March 21: “Typically if a company does business in China, they are automatically going to be required to have a cell of the Communist party in that company and that is going to lead to that intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military.” I suspect most Americans would find it mind-boggling that an American company would partner with our adversary in this way.
According to reports, the work Google is doing with China not only includes development of artificial intelligence technology that may possibly be used by Chinese military and intelligence services to exploit Americans’ data and privacy, but also the introduction of platforms that advance a value system and modes of behavior fundamentally at odds with our own, such as the censor-friendly search engine Project Dragonfly.
That Google persists in seeking partnerships in China – including building an artificial intelligence facility in Beijing – suggests a long-term commitment by the company to have China as a partner. Indeed, in October 2018 you described China as “a wonderful, innovative market” and said that “given how important the market is and how many users there are, we feel obliged to think hard about this problem and take a longer-term view.” And yet, a letter from 1,400 of your employees revealed that Google employees “do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.”
It is worth asking what Google stands to gain from partnering with a country that routinely violates basic human liberties, including maintaining detention facilities for nearly a million Uyghur Muslims, banning freedom of speech and the press, and repressing its Christian, Tibetan Buddhist and other religious communities. Is the technology Google develops, ostensibly for the welfare of consumers, being used by the Chinese government to further perpetuate these human rights violations?
I understand that today you have met with General Dunford and the President of the United States to address these concerns. Now meet with the American people by addressing publicly the work your company does in China, the benefits it may provide to the Chinese government and military, and your reluctance to partner or aid the Armed Forces of the United States.
Sincerely,
Josh D. Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: After Meeting with Army Corps on Flooding, Senator Hawley Calls for Major Reform

WASHINGTON
– After raising concerns about the historic flooding in Missouri with Secretary of the Army Mark Esper today in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley met with senior officials with the Army Corps of Engineers at his office this afternoon. Following the meeting, Sen. Hawley issued the following statement:
“The Army Corps of Engineers is an agency in search of a plan. After my meeting with the Corps, I am even more alarmed at the agency’s lack of clear priorities: agency leadership detailed eight different priorities, many in tension with one another, none of them integrated into a clear operating plan.
“The Corps is hamstrung on the one hand by radical environmentalist lobbyists that are forcing the agency to prioritize wildlife over farmers. This is made worse by the fact that Congress has failed to give the Corps a clear ranking of priorities or clear orders on how to achieve them.
“What is abundantly apparent is that we can’t go on like this. We need to consider serious reforms. These might include an overhaul of the Corps’ master manual or perhaps placing the Corps in another agency altogether.”

Title: In Exchange with Hawley, Chair of Joint Chiefs Declares Google Providing “Direct Benefit” to China’s Military
Date: Thursday, March 14, 2019

Content:
Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford confirmed that Google’s work in China is directly benefitting the Chinese military when responding to a line of questioning from Senator Hawley during today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. A
video of the exchange
and transcript are below:
HAWLEY: So I just want to make sure that I understand exactly what you’re saying. You’re telling me that Google, an American company, supposedly, is refusing to work with the Department of Defense, but is doing work with China, in China, in a way that at least indirectly benefits the Chinese government. Is that correct?
SHANAHAN: I haven’t heard the word refuse, but there’s a lack of willingness to support DOD programs.
HAWLEY: General you’re nodding your head do you want to weigh in on this?
DUNFORD: You know Senator I’m nodding my head on exactly the point that you made that the work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefitting the Chinese military. And I’ve been very public on this issue as well in fact the way I described it to our industry partners is ‘look we’re the good guys in the values that we represent and the system that we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive’ and that’s the way I’ve characterized it.
I was just nodding that what the Secretary was articulating is the general sense of all of us as leaders. We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing there is that indirect benefit, and frankly ‘indirect’ may be not a full characterization of the way it really is. It’s more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.
HAWLEY: I just want to underscore this for the record so that we are absolutely, perfectly, 100 percent clear here that Google, an American company based in this country, again supposedly an American company, is doing work in China that directly or indirectly benefits the Chinese government at a time of increased peer competition with this country. We are in a struggle with the Chinese government over whether or not they are going to become a regional and maybe global hegemon with values very different from ours, certainly values that do not favor freedom in the world. And we have an American company that does not want to do work with our defense department, which is one thing, but they’re happy to help the Chinese, at least the Chinese government that is, the Chinese military at least indirectly. I think that’s just extraordinary.

Title: Senator Hawley Grills Google Over Tracking and Data Collection on Consumers
Date: Tuesday, March 12, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON –
During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today, Senator Josh Hawley led a heated back and forth with a Google representative over the company’s tracking and data collection. Senator Hawley scrutinized Google’s lack of transparency around the information it collects when Android users turn location services off, highlighting the fact they continue to gather customers’ valuable, personal information even when a phone is not in use.
Google Senior Privacy Counsel Will DeVries tells Senator Josh Hawley the data they collect on consumers “is complicated” – and the Senator responds. To watch, click the image above or
go here.
Senator Hawley:
“Actually it’s not complicated. What’s complicated is you don’t allow consumers to stop your tracking of them. You tell them that you do, you would anticipate that they do, a consumer would have a reasonable expectation based on what you’ve told them that they’re not being tracked but in fact you’re still tracking it. You’re still gathering the information and you’re still using it.”
Senator Josh Hawley concludes his remarks.

Senator Hawley:
“Here’s my basic concern, is that Americans have not signed up for this. They think that the products that you’re offering them are free – they’re not free. They think that they can opt out of the tracking that you’re performing – they can’t meaningfully opt out. It’s kind of like that old Eagles song, you know, ‘you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.’ That’s kind of what it’s like dealing with your company and that’s a problem for the American consumer. It’s a real problem, and for somebody who has two small kids at home, the idea that your company and others like it are sweeping up information to build a user profile on them that will track every step, every movement, and monetize that, and they can’t do anything about it, and I can’t do anything about it – that’s a big problem that this Congress needs to address. Than you, Mr. Chairman.”

Title: Senators Hawley and Markey Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Stop Internet Companies from Spying on Children
Date: Tuesday, March 12, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) today
introduced legislation
aimed at stopping corporate giants, including social media titans, from targeting and tracking kids online. Among its many improvements, the bipartisan bill updates the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent and from anyone ages 13 to 15 without the user’s consent.
“Big tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids’ personal data. It’s time to hold them accountable,” said
Senator Hawley. “Congress needs to get serious about keeping our children’s information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online.”
“The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act remains the constitution for kids’ privacy online, but today we introduce an accompanying bill of rights,” said
Senator Markey,
original House author of COPPA. “In 2019, children and adolescents’ every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children’s well-being at the top of Congress’s priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.”
The legislation also creates an “eraser button” so parents and kids can delete personal information, and a “Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors” that limits the collection of personal information. The bill additionally establishes a first of its kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors and marketing directed at children and minors.
Text of the bill can be found
here.
The legislation strengthens privacy protections specifically for children and minors by:
Prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under 13 without
parental consent
and from anyone 13 to 15 years old without the
user’s consent
;
Banning targeted advertising directed at children;
Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Teens” that limits the collection of personal information of teens;
Revising COPPA’s “Actual knowledge” standard to a
“constructive knowledge”
standard for the definition of covered operators;
Creating an “
Eraser Button
” for parents and children by requiring companies to permit users to eliminate publicly available personal information content when technologically feasible;
Establishing a
Youth Marketing and Privacy Division
at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC);
Prohibiting the sale of internet connected devices to children and minors unless they meet robust cyber security standards;
Requiring manufacturers of connected devices to children and minors to prominently display on their packaging a
privacy dashboard
detailing how sensitive information is collected, transmitted, retained, used, and protected.

“GOP Sen. Josh Hawley slams ‘toothless’ federal response to privacy abuses at Facebook and Google”
Washington Post
By Tony Romm
March 11, 2019
Republican Sen. Josh Hawley on Monday issued a rare rebuke of the government agency that oversees Facebook, Google and other tech giants, charging that regulators had “failed” to protect consumers and their personal data from abuse.
In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the Missouri lawmaker urged the agency’s leaders to take a more aggressive stand toward Silicon Valley, starting with a series of investigations into tech companies for violating their users’ privacy repeatedly over the past year.
Hawley said there is “substantial evidence” that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices — a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. The GOP senator also faulted Facebook for its earlier efforts to monitor kids’ and adults’ app usage through a tool that was loaded onto iPhones in a way that angered Apple.
With Google, meanwhile, Hawley charged that the search giant had “consistently misinformed users about its use of geolocation data,” at times collecting that information from Android smartphones even when device owners thought they had disabled the tracking of their whereabouts.
In response to these and other high-profile privacy mishaps, Hawley said the FTC so far “has been toothless,” and he urged the agency to use all the power at its disposal to probe big tech companies — or tell Congress if it’s outmatched and needs help.
“For too long our nation has put off accounting for the price we paid in return for the benefits of the online platforms that now dominate American culture and industry,” Hawley wrote to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a fellow Republican.

Title: Senator Hawley Sends Letter to Neomi Rao Outlining Questions About Judicial Philosophy
Date: Tuesday, February 26, 2019

Content:
Today Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter to Neomi Rao outlining his questions about her judicial philosophy and approach to constitutional law. Senator Hawley has additional questions about Rao’s views on substantive due process – the doctrine that activist judges often rely on to justify making policy from the bench.
Senator Hawley and Neomi Rao are set to meet tomorrow, February 27, 2019.
Full text of the letter can be found below.
February 26, 2019
The Honorable Neomi Rao
Administrator
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
Office of Management and Budget
725 17th St. N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20503
Dear Ms. Rao:
I write to discuss your pending nomination to be a Circuit Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
I take seriously the Senate’s role in giving advice and consent to the President’s nominations to the judiciary. Like President Trump, I am committed to confirming judges who will adhere to an original understanding of the Constitution.
As a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, it is my responsibility to scrutinize every appellate court nominee’s approach to constitutional interpretation. That includes asking nominees about their understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment and substantive due process—the atextual doctrine that Supreme Court justices have invoked to strike down, among other things, state laws limiting abortion, and to justify judicial activism. Understanding that lower court judges are bound by precedent, I will not vote to confirm nominees whom I believe will expand substantive due process precedents like Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania.
I have reviewed your record as an attorney, as a professor, and as Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. I have read through your academic writings. And we have had substantive discussions on these and other jurisprudential issues at your nominations hearing, through written questions, and in a private meeting in my office.
After this review, I continue to have questions about your judicial philosophy and approach to constitutional law. Namely, I have concerns about some statements in your academic writings:
In your law review note, A Backdoor to Policy Making: The Use of Philosophers by the Supreme Court, you wrote that “extra-legal sources can help judges to determine when a departure from past practice might be necessary—philosophy might be a vehicle for legal change.” I would like to discuss this observation and your approach to the use of outside sources in interpreting statutes and the Constitution.
In another article, Three Concepts of Dignity in Constitutional Law, you discuss how “American constitutional law has a long history of treating individual choice and autonomy as an integral and preeminent component of human worth.” I have concerns about your views on whether the Constitution confers substantive constitutional rights to dignity and whether those rights trump democratically passed laws.
Later in Three Concepts of Dignity in Constitutional Law, you state that “[t]he Casey plurality treated a woman’s right to choose an abortion as part of her constitutionally protected liberty, because her choice implicated both dignity and autonomy,” and that the plurality opinion “linked reproductive choices with the essential nature of the individual and emphasized the importance of the freedom to make such choices without compulsion from the state.” I have questions about your analysis of the Court’s decision in Casey, as well as in Lawrence v. Texas, Gonzales v. Carhart, and other constitutional cases discussed in that article.
I look forward to meeting and discussing these issues on Wednesday, February 27, prior to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s vote on your judicial nomination.
Thank you for your willingness to be considered for this important position on one of our nation’s most prominent courts of appeals and to participate in this nomination process.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Sen. Hawley Demands More Answers from FBI Director Following McCabe Confirmation of Counterintelligence Investigation against President Trump
Date: Wednesday, February 20, 2019

Content:
Following recent
confirmation
by former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Deputy Director Andrew McCabe that the agency opened a counterintelligence investigation against the President of the United States, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a
second letter
to FBI Director Chris Wray demanding more answers regarding the agency’s tactics.
Senator Hawley is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which has oversight over the FBI.
Today’s letter follows a January
inquiry
from Senator Hawley to Director Wray about a
New York Times
report that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation against President Trump. Senator Hawley was recently named Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which
oversees
the FBI.
In his letter, Senator Hawley explains that he is “disturbed” by accounts of “blatant political bias within the FBI” and by the fact that Mr. McCabe had “actively explored ways to force the President from office” due to “on disagreements over the President’s foreign policy positions and removal of agency officials.”
Senator Hawley writes that “It is critical that the American people be able to trust the FBI. Following Mr. McCabe’s latest comments, prompt answers from the FBI are necessary to quell concerns that this agency—at its highest levels—has become infected with political bias.”
He submitted a list of new questions, in addition to those from his January letter, with a deadline of March 6, 2019.

Full text of the letter can be found below.
February 20, 2019
The Honorable Christopher A. Wray
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20535
Dear Director Wray:
Last month, I asked you to respond to questions regarding the FBI’s role in opening a counterintelligence investigation against the President that, according to media reports, was based largely on disagreements over the President’s foreign policy positions and removal of agency officials. You have not answered those questions. Since that time, more disturbing information has come to light.
Former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe has recently confirmed publicly that he ordered the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation against the President. He has also admitted that he had conversations with other officials about forcibly removing the President from office.
As Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which maintains oversight of your agency, I am disturbed by these accounts of blatant political bias within the FBI. Mr. McCabe launched an investigation to gather information that he intended to block the President from accessing and actively explored ways to force the President from office. These actions directly threaten the constitutional structure of the executive branch and place the political accountability of executive branch agencies in serious question.
It is critical that the American people be able to trust the FBI. Following Mr. McCabe’s latest comments, prompt answers from the FBI are necessary to quell concerns that this agency—at its highest levels—has become infected with political bias.
By March 6, 2019, please provide my office with responses to the questions in my initial letter, dated January 17, 2019. Please also answer the following:
Besides this investigation, has the FBI ever opened a counterintelligence investigation with the intent that the information not be made available to the President?
Who within the FBI objected to the decision to open a counterintelligence investigation with the intent of hiding the information from the President?
With whom did Mr. McCabe or others speak about attempts to forcibly remove the President from office under the 25th Amendment or through any other means?
What were the reasons the FBI identified for opening a counterintelligence investigation against the President?
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator

Title: Hawley, Blumenthal, & Markey Demand Answers on Facebook’s Monitoring of Teens
Date: Thursday, February 07, 2019

Content:
Following news reports that Facebook paid teenagers and adults to collect their sensitive personal data, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) wrote to Facebook demanding answers about the Project Atlas market research program. In separate letters to Apple and Google, the bipartisan members called on the companies to do more to protect their customers from intrusive monitoring practices.
Earlier this month, reporting by TechCrunch and others found that Facebook had secretly operated Project Atlas, a commercial research program that involved paying teenagers and adults to install to a mobile app that allowed Facebook to monitor users’ phones and web browsing history.
In advertisements and recruitment efforts, Facebook aggressively targeted teenagers and did not appear to adequately verify parental consent. The company also failed to provide participants with sufficient information about how it would collect, use, or keep their private data. In recent cases involving market research programs at Sears and Lenovo, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, even when paid, such programs must fully disclose the types of data collected and purposes for monitoring, particularly when programs involve the interception of encrypted web traffic. The senators also asked Facebook who had access to the sensitive data collected from participants and how the company verified parental consent.
“We write concerned about reports that Facebook is collecting highly-sensitive data on teenagers, including their web browsing, phone use, communications, and locations – all to profile their behavior without adequate disclosure, consent, or oversight,” wrote the senators in their letter to Facebook.
Hawley, Blumenthal, and Markey also called attention to Facebook’s long history of using personal data for potentially anti-competitive purposes, such as acquiring or copying emerging competitors using data from its controversial Onavo Protect VPN app. TechCrunch reported that Facebook had bypassed Apple’s review processes and circumvented attempts by Apple to protect its consumers, using the Onavo Protect app that Apple had already banned from the App Store for privacy reasons.
“These reports fit with longstanding concerns that Facebook has used its products to deeply intrude into personal privacy. Additionally, the scope of the research and the use of the Onavo Protect app raises questions about Facebook’s use of personal data to engage in potentially anti-competitive behavior,” wrote the senators in their letter to Facebook.
In separate letters to Apple and Google, the senators asked the companies for information on what they were doing to protect their customers from intrusive monitoring practices. Hawley, Blumenthal, and Markey also requested information how many devices Facebook monitored and whether Facebook had circumvented Apple and Google’s app review processes in other cases.
“Platforms must be vigilant in light of threats to teen privacy posed by programs like Project Atlas. Facebook is not alone in engaging in commercial monitoring of teens,” wrote the Senators in their letters to Apple and Google.
The senators also asked Google about reports that the company has conducted a monitoring program similar to Facebook’s Project Atlas, and demanded to know why Google has yet to remove Facebook’s Onavo Protect app from its Play Store.

Tonight, Senator Josh Hawley issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s State of the Union address:
“Tonight, President Trump challenged Congress to break through partisan gridlock and get working for the American people. That’s what we were sent to Washington to do: work at getting real things done. He outlined an ambitious path forward and I commend him.
“I was pleased to hear the president discuss his plans to lower the cost of health care. That’s a top priority of mine in the Senate. Congress should immediately break up the big government-big insurance axis and lower health care prices for Americans. We also need to guarantee protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
“The president was also right to emphasize border security tonight. Supporting border security shouldn’t be hard. I can only hope that my Democrat colleagues will put their partisan vendettas and 2020 presidential aspirations aside to tackle this pressing crisis. We’ve got to get an immigration system that works for Missouri, and it begins by putting American workers ahead of those who come here illegally.”

Date: Tuesday, February 05, 2019

Content:
U.S. Senator Josh Hawley applauded the Senate’s passing of S.1, the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act (SASME) of 2019. SASME is a bipartisan bill to strengthen America’s security in the Middle East, sanction the Assad regime, and counter the anti-Israel boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.
Senator Josh Hawley supported the legislation and released the following statement:
“It’s important that we remember who our friends are in the Middle East. This legislation strengthens U.S. security in the Middle East by boosting military support for Israel and Jordan, imposes new sanctions against the Assad regime, and reaffirms American support for Israel by making it easier for states and localities to approve laws to combat the anti-Israel BDS movement.”
Background (CRS Bill Digest)
This bill authorizes assistance and weapons transfers to Israel, and extends defense cooperation with Jordan. It establishes additional sanctions related to the conflict in Syria and allows states to divest from entities boycotting Israel.
The bill reauthorizes through FY2028 Foreign Military Financing to Israel. It extends loan guarantees to Israel through FY2023, and authorizes the President to transfer precision-guided munitions to the country.
The bill directs the Department of the Treasury to determine whether the Central Bank of Syria is a primary money-laundering concern and, if so, impose special measures on transactions involving the bank. The bill also imposes sanctions on individuals providing support for the Syrian government.
The bill allows a state or local government to adopt measures to divest its assets from entities using boycotts, divestments, or sanctions to influence Israel’s policies. Such measures shall meet various requirements, including those related to written notice and comment.
The bill extends through 2022 arrangements that allow certain defense articles to be transferred to Jordan on an expedited basis. The bill also directs the President to submit a report to Congress assessing the costs and benefits of establishing a fund to support private investment in Jordan.

Transcript:
HAWLEY: You talk about the need to embrace not just confrontation but competitiveness with China. Some of the things I’m concerned about, you also point out that China has embraced a model of high-tech authoritarianism, which seems exactly right to me. We’re all familiar or hopefully familiar with the fact that China is requiring these technology transfer agreements with companies, U.S. companies, doing business there and just looking at some headlines from this past year: Apple has now signed onto these technology transfer agreements putting sensitive encryption keys in China, Facebook giving data access to Chinese firms that have been flagged by U.S. intelligence, Google – patent agreements with Chinese firms. Should we be concerned about these technology transfer requirements on the Chinese side and should we perhaps consider preventing these in the law?
RATNER: It’s an important question and I think the answer is on a case-by-case basis but I do think that the way forward here is not to wag our finger here and ask these companies to act in the national interest but to set boundaries on their behavior and if there are instances where these companies are transferring technologies that have important security or future technological implications for American competitiveness then certainly the U.S. government should consider new export controls.

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has been selected for two subcommittees on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the 116th Congress. They include the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight & Emergency Management.

Of note, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was originally known as the Truman Committee when it was organized in 1941. Additional information about these subcommittees, from the
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI)
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is the Committee’s chief investigative subcommittee and has the responsibility of studying and investigating the efficiency and economy of operations relating to all branches of the government. The Subcommittee is also tasked with studying and investigating the compliance or noncompliance with rules, regulations and laws, investigating all aspects of crime and lawlessness within the United States which have an impact upon or affect the national health, welfare and safety, including syndicated crime, investment fraud schemes, commodity and security fraud, computer fraud, and the use of offshore banking and corporate facilities to carry out criminal objectives.
Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight & Emergency Management (FSO)
The Federal Spending Oversight subcommittee is charged with examining all federal expenditures to ensure the taxpayer is getting the highest value for their dollar. To fulfill this objective the subcommittee seeks to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, no matter how small, and to proactively pursue mechanisms to prevent waste of taxpayer dollars.  Further this subcommittee is responsible for providing oversight of the federal emergency and disaster response and preparedness apparatus. That includes FEMA and the government’s efforts to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural and man-made disasters, including state and local grant programs.

Title: Senator Hawley Questions FBI Over Reports of Counterintelligence Investigation Against President
Date: Thursday, January 17, 2019

Content:
Following a recent
report
by the
New York Times
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a counterintelligence investigation against the President of the United States, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a
letter
today to FBI Director Chris Wray questioning the agency’s tactics.
In his letter, Senator Hawley called the news report “alarming” and said it “brings to mind some of the darker chapters of the FBI’s history, when unaccountable individuals within the FBI used the agency’s investigatory powers as a weapon against political opponents.”
Senator Hawley writes that “The FBI has no authority to encroach on the President’s foreign policy prerogatives. Yet these press reports state that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation because the President’s foreign policy positions and exercise of his constitutional authority to appoint and dismiss officials might have ‘hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved.’”
Full text can be found below.
January 17, 2019
The Honorable Christopher A. Wray
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20535
Dear Director Wray:
I write regarding recent reporting in the New York Times and elsewhere that, after President Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, FBI agents opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether the President’s exercise of his constitutional prerogatives to conduct foreign policy, oversee investigations, and appoint and dismiss officers were themselves a threat to national security.
[1]
This reporting brings to mind some of the darker chapters of the FBI’s history, when unaccountable individuals within the FBI used the agency’s investigatory powers as a weapon against political opponents. As you know, the President has “plenary and exclusive power … as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.” United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Co., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936). But according to these press reports, FBI agents opened a counterintelligence investigation against the President based largely on foreign policy disagreements like his “refus[al] to criticize Russia on the campaign trail” and the Republican Party’s convention platform on Ukraine.
The FBI has no authority to encroach on the President’s foreign policy prerogatives. Yet these press reports state that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation because the President’s foreign policy positions and exercise of his constitutional authority to appoint and dismiss officials might have “hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved.” Even more disturbing, in a direct threat to agency accountability, the FBI agents in question reportedly considered opening the investigation without the direction or supervision of their leadership, and with the aim of avoiding any later order to cease the investigation.
I am deeply troubled by these accounts. That FBI agents would seek to bring a counterintelligence investigation against the President as a potential national-security threat for the exercise of his office is more than unprecedented—it is alarming. It undermines the political accountability and structure of the executive branch.
In response to these concerns, please provide my office with the following information:
Outside of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, is the FBI conducting a counterintelligence investigation against the President for the exercise of his constitutional authority in dismissing Director Comey?
Which officials within the FBI authorized the opening of a counterintelligence investigation, did they obtain pre-approval with supervisors, were they subject to any disciplinary review or action, and do they remain employed with the FBI today?
Has the FBI ever previously initiated a counterintelligence investigation against the President based on the exercise of his constitutional authority?
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Josh Hawley
U.S. Senator
