WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement announcing he will not be attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Joint Address to Congress.

“For nearly 10 months, Netanyahu has waged a deadly and excessive response that has targeted Gazan civilians. It is wildly inappropriate to give the distinct honor of addressing Congress to a man who has violated international human rights law so severely that an arrest warrant for war crimes has been recommended by the International Criminal Court. I regret that one has not been issued yet, as I would have gladly served it to him on the House floor. Additionally, he’s failed to rescue or secure the release of the more than 100 of his citizens who remain hostages of Hamas, while ignoring the pleas of their family members to bring them home. It’s time for Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire now and get the hostages back.”

As a member of Congress, Rep. Pocan is entitled to invite a guest to attend the speech. He has chosen Maya Roman, a cousin of Yarden Roman, who was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7th, 2023, and released after 54 days.==

“The current Supreme Court has become a wing of the Republican Party, doing its bidding to reelect a convicted felon to the White House. Today’s ruling throws 249 years of equal justice under the law out the window and makes the president a king above the law. This Court is a disgrace and has put our democracy on the brink. Elections have consequences. This November, we must do whatever we can to save our democracy."==

MADISON, WI –Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after President Biden announced that he would not authorize any offensive weapons transfers to Israel if they were to invade Rafah:

“More than one million innocent Palestinians have been backed into a corner with nowhere to go. If Israel were to invade Rafah, tens of thousands of Palestinians would needlessly die. President Biden is right to use his leverage to prevent Israel from inflicting further unnecessary bloodshed. It’s time for a ceasefire and for Hamas to release all the hostages. We must end this war and work toward a two-state solution that works for all.”

Rep. Pocan has previously called for the United States to withhold offensive weapons transfers when he, Reps. McGovern, Schakowsky, and 53 of their colleaguessent a letter to President Bidenin April urging him to do so.==

Title: Pocan Votes For Much-Needed Ukraine Aid, Against Unconditional Weapons for Israel
Date: April 20, 2024
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, released the following statement after the House of Representatives voted to advance separate pieces of legislation to provide military assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as humanitarian relief for the crises in Gaza, Ukraine, and other conflict zones.

“For more than two years, Vladimir Putin has waged an unjust war against Ukraine. This bill provides much-needed military assistance to Ukraine to fight back and regain its territory, hopefully putting an end to this war without putting American boots on the ground. I’m glad Speaker Johnson finally allowed the House to take action on this critical funding on its own, and I was glad to vote in favor of the Ukraine Supplemental.

“Today’s votes also included billions of dollars in unconditional weapons for Israel. While the Israel Supplemental bill also included necessary funding for global humanitarian assistance as well as funding for the Iron Dome and other Israeli defense systems that rightly enable Israel to defend itself, I could not in good conscience vote for more offensive weapons to be given to Israel to be used in Gaza without any conditions attached. The devastation inflicted upon innocent civilians in Gaza is unjustifiable, and the United States cannot continue providing Prime Minister Netanyahu with a blank check to expand this conflict. Further arming Netanyahu and his extreme coalition could only lead us to a wider conflict in the Middle East. A ceasefire and freeing the hostages while also redoubling the efforts to achieve a two-state solution is the surest way toward peace in the region; more bombs to kill starving kids is not.”

Pocan also voted in favor of legislation to provide $8 billion to bolster security in the Indo-Pacific, including through security assistance to Taiwan.==

Floor Remarks on the Ongoing War in Israel and Gaza

Remarks as Delivered

I’ve been attending town halls and meetings across my district over the last two weeks. Smaller communities in Wisconsin like Edgerton, Sauk City, Monroe, Mazomanie, and Darlington. Smaller communities with hard-working people with a strong work ethic and upper Midwestern values like fairness and compassion.

And at those meetings, I’ve heard a common thread. They don’t like what they are seeing in Gaza and Israel. The vast majority recognize that the attack on October 7th was horrific, and Israel had a right to respond. But they didn’t have a right to collectively punish 2.3 million people stuck in Gaza.

They know that 1,200 people are dead in Israel from the attack, and over 130 people are still being held by Hamas. But they also know that nearly 34,000 people are dead in Gaza, 70% of which are women and children – clearly not members of Hamas.

They know that 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza, and the majority of the buildings and infrastructure have been demolished or damaged by Israeli bombs.

They know that the people are dying of starvation because almost every entry point to Gaza is through Israel, and not enough supplies and aid are getting through. And, they understand that the United States is trying to help with aid, but we have to drop it from the air or bring it in by sea because our friend Israel won’t allow us to bring it in through easier, safer ways like by truck and transport.

They know that aid workers are being killed – 200 plus to date – including some from Chef Jose Andres’s World Central Kitchen. The limited food, water, and supplies that are being let in have to be distributed, but aid workers are too often killed in the process of delivering humanitarian aid, making alleviating suffering even more difficult.

And they don’t understand how we can both provide armaments and aid to the same area, as that doesn’t make sense to people with Midwestern sensibilities.

They tell me it looks like punishment for being Palestinian. They tell me it appears Benjamin Netanyahu wants people to leave Gaza for good. They tell me it looks too much like what genocide would look like – and that concerns them greatly.

And the bombings of the World Central Kitchen workers – the seemingly targeted and repeated bombings, despite the Israeli military knowing their location and purpose – has been one more step too far by Netanyahu’s government’s handling of this war.

Enough is enough.

The indiscriminate killing must stop. The aid must flow. The hostages must be released. A ceasefire must hold to protect every child in Gaza and Israel.

The devastation has been severe, far more severe than it ever needed to be. The world would have understood a response going after Hamas killers. But the Netanyahu government has gone too far, way too far, in its response.

That’s why I helped lead a letter, signed by 56 members of Congress, to the President, to stop any additional offensive arms transfers to Israel without a thorough investigation of the World Central Kitchen killings and a plan for aid and assistance to get to starving Palestinians.

The United States has long supported two nations, existing side-by-side, in peace – a two-state solution. But Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t support that reasoned path to peace. And that, along with his punishing innocent Palestinians while allegedly going after Hamas, has made it time to get a divorce from Benjamin Netanyahu.

I support the overwhelming majority of Israelis who want peace. They want to live safely without bombs raining on them from extremists in Gaza. They too don’t like the direction and mistakes of the Netanyahu administration. And they want the hostages returned immediately.

And the overwhelming majority of Palestinians want peace as well. They just want to live their lives with dignity and independence, as they should. But they need to be treated as equals with human rights, which too often they are not.

I urge our government to do more to help distribute aid, utilizing great groups like the World Central Kitchen and UNRWA and others that are doing this work. And our government must stop supplying any offensive weapons or equipment that damages Gaza further, especially in regards to any invasion of Rafah.

Let’s take this awful current situation and make some good come out of it. We need to double down on a two-state solution that recognizes the many, many good people of Israel and Palestine that want to live in peace.

It is achievable. And the United States is crucial to that peace. That’s what I’m hearing in my district.

I yield back.==
Title: Pocan, McGovern, Schakowsky Urge Biden, Blinken to Withhold Weapons Transfers After Humanitarian Aid Workers Killed
Date: April 5, 2024
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Jim McGovern (MA-02), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09)and 37 of their colleagues sent a letter to President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken asking them to withhold pending offensive weapons transfers to Israel after seven humanitarian aid workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, were killed in an Israeli airstrike, and to place conditions on future weapons assistance.

“We write to express our shared concern and outrage regarding the recent Israeli airstrike which killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, including an American citizen,”the Members wrote.“In light of this incident, we strongly urge you to reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel and to withhold this and any future offensive arms transfers until a full investigation into the airstrike is completed. If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable. We also urge you to withhold these transfers if Israel fails to sufficiently mitigate harm to innocent civilians in Gaza, including aid workers, and if it fails to facilitate – or arbitrarily denies or restricts – the transport and delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.”

“It is estimated that over 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of this war, nearly half of whom are children,”the Members continued.“While we appreciate your administration’s recent efforts to increase the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, these efforts will not be sufficient to meet the extraordinary need on the ground. The Israeli government’s restrictions on the flow of aid into Gaza, coupled with the death and grave harm that aid workers have faced during this war, are compounding this hunger crisis. Recent reports indicate that hundreds of aid trucks sit idle outside the Rafah border crossing due to Israel’s restrictions. And now over 200 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. These attacks and deaths are having a chilling effect with the World Central Kitchen and other humanitarian groups now suspending their operations in Gaza. Until now, World Central Kitchen has provided more than 43 million meals to Palestinians in Gaza, lending support to 68 community kitchens throughout the territory and serving more than 170,000 hot meals each day. Its services are irreplaceable, and its absence will fuel the growing hunger crisis in Gaza.”

“In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers,”the Members concluded.“We again strongly urge you to withhold any offensive weapons transfers until the investigation into the airstrike is concluded and, if it is found this strike violated U.S. or international law, those responsible are held accountable. And we again urge you to ensure that any future military assistance to Israel, including already authorized transfers, is subject to conditions to ensure it is used in compliance with U.S. and international law.”

Title: Pocan Votes to Fund Government for Remainder of FY24
Date: March 22, 2024
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, voted to advance the remaining six appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24), allowing the government to continue operating through the end of the fiscal year.

“Passing the minibus ensured we didn’t shut down the U.S. government or enact dozens of extreme policy riders or deep cuts the Republican majority tried to force. These measures include expanding access to child care, keeping workers safe, and giving our troops a raise. Any inaction toward this bill could have shut down the government, allowing the GOP leadership to give us a bill that would have been worse, riddled with extreme priorities. House Democrats played the best hand with the cards we were dealt.

“I’m not supportive of some provisions in this bill, including a delay of additional funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This is a continuation of the Administration’s current policy toward the agency which must be overturned. I support immediately providing much-needed funding toward the agency and will continue my work to do just that.”

By passing the bill, Democrats rejected many extreme Republican cuts and policy riders. Instead, this government funding package provides:

• $1 billion increase for child care and Head Start.
• $20 million increase for Title I education funding, rejecting Republican efforts to eliminate 224,000 teachers’ jobs.
• $14 million increase in funding for special education.
• Protects funding for the maximum Pell Grant at $7,395 per student.
• $1.1 billion for Senior Nutrition Programs, which includes Meals on Wheels.
• Increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, including for cancer and Alzheimer’s research.
• Provides 5.2% pay increase for servicemembers and increases the Basic Allowance for Housing by 5.4%.
• $1 billion increase for climate change and resilience activities.
• Adds 12,000 more Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the United States.
• Includes $29.9 billion to support the reunification of migrant families cruelly separated at the southern border by the Trump administration.
• Removes numerous Republican policy riders including 10 that would have limited women’s access to reproductive health, 44 that attacked the rights of the LGBTQI+ community, and banned funding for President Biden’s executive orders to address the climate crisis.

As a member of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting all federal funding legislation, Rep. Pocan looks forward to Wisconsin – and Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District – receiving the funding it needs and deserves.

This package includes the following funding bills: Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.

A detailed summary of the legislation is availablehere.

A package containing six other appropriations bills for fiscal year 2024, including all of Rep. Pocan’s earmarks, passed the House earlier this month and was signed into law by President Biden on March 9.==

“Derrick Van Orden continues to embarrass Wisconsin and the United States Congress with his constant unbecoming behavior.

This constant pattern of unnecessary outbursts, whether it’s teen pages in the Capitol Rotunda or administration officials at a classified briefing, has many of us worried about his temperament and perhaps his soberness.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), co-chair and co-founder of the Congressional Labor Caucus, announced he was bringing Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO, as his guest to this year’s State of the Union. President Shuler represents more than 12 million workers nationwide, including thousands of Wisconsinites.

“I’m honored to have President Shuler as my guest at the State of the Union,”Pocan said.“With Liz at the AFL-CIO and President Biden in the White House, workers have their strongest champions in years. In three years, President Biden has prioritized American workers, bringing them to the table when moving legislation forward and strengthening workers’ rights. From the Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, American workers will have better opportunities than ever before. I urge President Biden to call on Congress to advance legislation that helps all workers, not just reward those at the top. I look forward to hearing what he says on Thursday night.”

“Congressman Pocan is a champion for working people and I'm honored he invited me to view the State of the Union with him,”said Shuler.“Too often in DC the State of the Union gets looked at through what boxes get checked or how many times a word is said - and those details matter of course - but it’s also important to step back and realize that the sum of President Biden’s actions have resulted in launching another industrial revolution with transformational policies for workers and communities that will last for generations.”

“Having fairer and more representative legislative district maps than the Republican gerrymandered map is a win for democracy. However, if a lawsuit is filed in the 7th Circuit challenging these new maps, the GOP legislature must commit to defending them in court, just as they’ve promised not to challenge them. It’s now their maps. Further, this makes fair federal maps even more important, as the legislature only dealt with state maps. The Wisconsin State Supreme Court must act soon and enact fair congressional maps.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.  –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, wrote to Steve Womack, the Chair of the subcommittee, and Ranking Member Steny Hoyer, calling on them to invite Postmaster General Louis DeJoy for a hearing. This follows a letter Congressman Pocan sent to the Postmaster General last week after reports of increasingly widespread delays and disruptions in mail delivery and postal services affecting residents in his district.

“My office has heard from residents in the district who have been frustrated by significant delays in their mail delivery which has affected their ability to receive paychecks and Social Security checks on time, pay their bills, and receive lifesaving prescription medications, jeopardizing their health, safety, and well-being,”Pocan wrote.

“This is simply unacceptable. While I am hopeful that Postmaster General DeJoy will accept my invitation and take seriously the concerns of my constituents, I also believe that we cannot simply hope for improvements, but also have a responsibility to exercise our oversight authority of the USPS as members of the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee,”Pocan continued.

“The Postal Service is a vital lifeline for millions of Americans across the country, and although the agency has faced financial difficulties for some time, Postmaster General DeJoy’s tenure has brought an increased level of instability that cannot go unaddressed by Congress. To that end, I strongly urge you to include an oversight hearing on the United States Postal Service in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2025 appropriations hearing schedule,”Pocan wrote.

They wasted seven months trying to pass extreme appropriations bills, not a single one of which has been signed into law or even taken up by the Senate. Funding the government is the most basic function of Congress. It’s past time for Republicans to get serious and work with Democrats to fund the government for a full year instead of just a few weeks at a time.”

MADISON, WI –Today,U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after a lawsuit was announced challenging the boundaries of Wisconsin’s current congressional districts:

“Wisconsin is a purple state, however, our current congressional district maps do not reflect that. Last month, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overruled the “least changed” theory regarding Wisconsin’s gerrymandered state legislative district maps. It’s time they do the same for our congressional district maps. I fully support today’s lawsuit on behalf of Wisconsin citizens as it tries to rectify this wrong and make these federal districts fair to all Wisconsinites.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after voting against final passage of the $886 billion FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill he has never voted in favor of since being elected to Congress:

“Time and time again, Congress seems to be able to find the money to fund the defense contractors while simultaneously ignoring the needs of everyday Americans here at home. It is impossible to justify the nearly $1 trillion price tag when the Pentagon just recently failed its 6th audit in a row. We must stop rewarding failure year after year. While I’m pleased this bill does not include many of the bigoted policies that were included in the House-passed version in July, it is still a bloated bill that fails to address the Pentagon’s continued inability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars.”

The FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed the House with a vote of 310-118 and now heads to President Biden’s desk for his signature.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after he voted present on a House Republican resolution “condemning and denouncing the drastic rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world” (H.Res. 894):

“I strongly condemn in no uncertain terms the significant rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia plaguing our country. Just last month, a group of neo-Nazis marched in my district, and I unequivocally denounced this hateful act.

“However, today’s House vote on this partisan resolution is meaningless in that it does nothing to address antisemitism in a real and tangible way, but rather is a bad faith attempt by the Republican majority to use the Jewish community for political gain.

“The day that House Republicans condemn Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for her anti-Semitic comments, including on ‘Jewish Space Lasers’ causing forest fires, will be the day I start taking this House majority seriously in their rhetoric on antisemitism. Until then, because there is no button on the House floor for me to vote ‘this is in lieu of Republicans being able to govern,’ the closest option I have is to vote ‘present’ on this meaningless resolution, while we can’t even pass Appropriations bills.

“I stand with the Jewish community in South Central Wisconsin and across the globe. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this partisan charade and actually bring legislation to the floor that will help address the immediate and present threat of antisemitism.”

Title: Pocan Introduces Bills to Create National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture
Date: October 27, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.– As LGBTQI+ History Month comes to a close,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, introduced two bills to begin the process of creating a National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture.

“As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Rep. Pocan said. “It is vital to remember our collective past – particularly when certain states, and even Members of Congress, seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that harm LGBTQI+ youth and our community at large. Let’s tell these stories, the good and the bad, and honor the many contributions the LGBTQI+ community has made to this nation with a museum in Washington, D.C. I look forward to the passage of this legislation and to visiting this museum in the near future.”

Rep. Pocan introduced bills to establish a commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. Both bills are required to be signed into law to create a new Smithsonian Museum.

The first bill creates an eight-member commission – consisting of individuals with various expertise in museum planning or LGBTQI+ research and culture – to look into the viability of establishing such a facility in the nation’s Capital. The measure would require this commission to:

• Report recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture;
• Develop a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the museum through public contributions;
• Obtain an independent review of this fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the museum and its operations and maintenance without reliance on federal funds;
• Report on the availability and cost of acquiring collections for the museum, identify potential locations for the facility in Washington, D.C., and determine its regional impact on other museums; and,
• Submit to Congress a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the museum.

The bill would also direct the commission's recommendations to address whether the museum should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum and research complex. The commission would have 18 months to complete the full study.

After the commission completes its work and issues its recommendations, Congress can consider the second bill to formally create the museum.

Chair Pocan was joined by all 8 openly LGBTQI+ Co-Chairs of the Equality Caucus in introducing this legislation, including Representatives Mark Takano (D-CA), Sharice Davids (D-KS), Robert Garcia (D-CA), Becca Balint (D-VT), Ritchie Torres (D-NY), Chris Pappas (D-NH), Angie Craig (D-MN), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL).==

WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement on his call for a cessation of hostilities towards civilians by all parties in the war between Israel and Hamas and for a robust humanitarian aid package:"The situation in Israel and Gaza continues to deteriorate. While the violent attack by Hamas on the Israeli people was brutal, it has lessened, and the retaliation by Israel toward Hamas is in full swing.

“My concern, however, is that the retaliation by Israel is less targeted at Hamas or Islamic Jihad, and more closely resembles a collective punishment against all Palestinians and others living in Gaza. From public comments to the sheer volume of bombs and areas targeted, this attack does not appear to be strategically targeting Hamas as originally stated."I join the manyhumanitarian groupsworking in Gaza incalling for an immediate cessation of hostilitiestowards civilians by all parties in this war. Both the overly broad retaliation of the Israeli government and the continued random missile fires of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad must stop.

“Further, we must helpfacilitate essential and life-saving assistance, including food, water, medical supplies and more to Gaza.We must also do more to provide for humanitarian access to these supplies and corridors for people who want to leave troubled areas, and any hostages held by Hamas must be released immediately.

“Additionally, the aid needed to help in Gaza from the United States must be robust.While I appreciate the initial $100 million announced by President Biden in aid to Gaza and the West Bank, we all know much more is needed to help in the initial estimate of $3-5 billion that is necessary. As a supplemental funding bill for Ukraine, Israel, and more moves forward, we must ensure it includes robust funding for humanitarian aid for both Israel and the impoverished people of Gaza.

“There is something that clearly links the people of both Israel and Palestine: there are way too many deaths of children that should never have occurred. This must stop, without excuse or hesitation.”

“Workers made concessions when the auto manufacturers needed help – now that the companies are making record profits, they need to support their workers. While executives continue to give themselves raises, many hard-working employees who keep these plants running have struggled to make ends meet. Auto workers keep our economy running and our country moving. It was inspiring to stand in solidarity with Local 75 – and all UAW workers – in their fight for better wages, stronger safety standards, and dignity at work.”

Title: As Bullying on Campus Remains Widespread—Particularly for LGBTQ+ Students—Pocan, Murray, Baldwin, Renew Push to Pass Anti-Harassment Legislation
Date: September 22, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI-02), introduced theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2023to help prevent bullying and harassment at colleges and universities around the country. The bill would finally require colleges and universities receiving federal support to establish anti-harassment policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion, and it would require schools to recognize “cyberbullying” as a form of harassment.

Today marks the anniversary of the death of Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who tragically lost his life to suicide in 2010 after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over his sexual orientation.

“No one should be bullied or harassed because of who they are or who they love,”said Representative Pocan.“Today we honor Tyler’s life by reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to ensure that students can learn in peace and not have to worry about living in fear or humiliation for being themselves.”

“Every student deserves a safe and supportive learning environment—but bullying and harassment on college campuses remains widespread, especially for LGBTQ+ students, and federal law doesn’t currently require schools to adopt comprehensive anti-harassment policies,”said Senator Murray.“Establishing strong anti-harassment policies will help make sure every student can pursue a higher education free from bullying and discrimination. I’m proud to honor Tyler Clementi’s life by renewing our push to pass this critical legislation.”

“No one should live in fear of being bullied just because of who they are, especially in our schools,”said Senator Baldwin.“In the face of increased harassment and discrimination, particularly against members of the LGBTQ+ community, our legislation makes crystal clear that kind of hate has no place on our college campuses or universities. All students deserve to have the freedom to succeed in a safe and healthy place and pursue their dreams, free of discrimination.”

Students across the country continue to face widespread bullying and harassment on college campuses, and LGBTQ+ students are nearly twice as likely to experience harassment in higher education. A report published last year found thatone-third of LGBTQ+ studentsat four-year colleges were bullied, harassed, or assaulted, and 19% of their non-LGBTQ+ peers were similarly mistreated. This widespread harassment has detrimental effects on student’s wellbeing and educational opportunities. The same 2022 report found that 35% of LGBTQ+ students said their mental health was not good all or most of the time they were in college, and LGBTQ+ youth continue to experience a significantly higher risk of suicide—with45%of LGBTQ youth seriously considering attempting suicide in the last year.

TheTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Actwould help protect students from campus bullying and harassment and address this widespread issue by:

1. Requiring all colleges and universities receiving federal aid to prohibit the harassment of enrolled students based on their actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion;
2. Requiring schools to distribute their anti-harassment policy to all students and employees, including prospective students and employees, upon request.
3. Requiring schools to recognize “cyberbullying” as a form of harassment; and
4. Creating a grant program to help colleges and universities start or expand programs to prevent harassment and provide counseling services to students who have experienced harassment.

“We are grateful to all those who keep working to improve school environments by making them kinder, safer, and more inclusive than what Tyler experienced while attending an institution of higher education,”said Jane Clementi, Tyler Clementi’s mother and Co-Founder and CEO of the Tyler Clementi Foundation.“Special thanks to Congressman Pocan and Senators Murray and Baldwin for reintroducing theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act. We fully support this legislation because we believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. After all, every student deserves a positive educational experience free of harassment, bullying or humiliation in an inclusive learning environment where they can study, grow, and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school’s care.”

“College is hard enough without the added layer of harassment and cyberbullying that so many LGBTQ+ students experience,”said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.“The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act would set the tone that harassment on campus is not going to be tolerated, and it would provide a layer of protection for vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ students. We thank Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Congressman Mark Pocan for introducing this important piece of legislation.”

“Harassment and bullying are far too common on college campuses, which is why the National Women’s Law Center strongly supports this legislation to help ensure that all students feel safe at their college or university,”said Shiwali Patel, Director of Justice for Student Survivors & Senior Counsel at the National Women’s Law Center.“It is long past time that institutions of higher learning have the resources that they need to root out this awful discrimination, and I am grateful to Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan for their leadership in reintroducing this important bill.”

26 Senators joined Senators Murray and Baldwin in introducing the legislation today, including: Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cardin, Casey, Duckworth, Feinstein, Fetterman, Gillibrand, Hassan, Hirono, Kaine, Klobuchar, Luján, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Padilla, Sanders, Schatz, Shaheen, Smith, Van Hollen, Warren, Whitehouse, and Wyden.

41 Representatives joined Representative Pocan in introducing the legislation today, including: Representatives Bonamici, Brownley, Carbajal, Casten, Castor, Davids, Danny Davis, DelBene, Doggett, Espaillat, Garamendi, Keating, Khanna, Kilmer, Kuster, Summer Lee, McCollum, Meng, Moore, Morelle, Moulton, Nadler, Panetta, Pappas, Peters, Pingree, Quigley, Raskin, Sánchez, Scanlon, Schakowsky, Schiff, Sherrill, Adam Smith, Stansbury, Swalwell, Takano, Tonko, Ritchie Torres, Wasserman Schultz, and Watson Coleman.

TheTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2023is endorsed by: the Tyler Clementi Foundation, the American College Health Association, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, GLSEN, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC), and The Trevor Project.

Title: Pocan Reacts to Van Orden Senate Page Harassment Footage

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after he reviewed the security footage showingRepresentative Derrick Van Orden (WI-03)accosting and verbally harassing teenage Senate pages while they were enjoying the U.S. Capitol rotunda this past summer:

“This video was bad and unbecoming of a Member of Congress. There is no way to prove Derrick was drunk, but this is not behavior a sober or sane person would do. He looked unbalanced and had belligerent hand gestures when he was threatening these teenagers. He towered over many of them and then followed them when they got up to leave. This was abusive behavior intended to frighten these pages.

“It’s odd enough to have a raging party in your office until midnight. But even more concerning is taking a large group of people to tour the Capitol at midnight and pushing others around to show off, including a bow to his guests afterward. Representative Van Orden’s behavior does not reflect Wisconsin values and he owes each of the pages and his constituents an apology.”

There are privacy and safety concerns of the young Senate pages and their families about releasing the video footage for fear of retribution from MAGA activists. Due to these concerns, the video will not be released.==

“I understand there are privacy and safety concerns of the young Senate pages and their families about releasing the video footage for fear of retribution from extreme MAGA activists. It was unfortunate that these teenagers were put in this position to defend themselves from a potentially drunk and belligerent Member of Congress. However, these future leaders of America should not have to endure any harassment when MAGA trolls try to distort the truth and help defend their fellow January 6th insurrectionist. It is my understanding the video will not be released.

Title: Pocan Asks House Admin Chair Steil to Release Irate Van Orden Footage
Date: August 1, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI – Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) sent a letter to the Chairman of the House Committee on Administration, Representative Bryan Steil (WI-01), urging him to release the July 26-27, 2023 security footage from the Capitol Rotunda where Representative Derrick Van Orden (WI-03) allegedly screamed at high school-aged Senate pages.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Steil,

I am writing to you regarding recent reports that on the evening of July 26, 2023, Representative Derrick Van Orden (WI-03) verbally accosted a group of high school-age Senate pages in the Capitol Rotunda and behaved in a physically aggressive manner toward the teenagers. As Chairman of the House Committee on Administration, you have jurisdiction over matters of Capitol security. Therefore, I call on you to immediately release the security footage from inside the Capitol Rotunda on the evening of July 26 and early morning hours of July 27, 2023 to ensure greater transparency into this incident.

As you are no doubt aware, initial reports of the incident stated that the group of Senate pages were in the Rotunda that evening to take pictures during their last week at the Capitol, and while there, some of the teenagers positioned themselves and their camera on the floor in order to capture a photo of the interior of the historic Capitol dome. The vast reporting states that when Representative Van Orden came across the teenagers, who spent their summer providing vital support to daily operations at the Capitol, he “became enraged” and swore at the pages, calling them “lazy s----” and telling them to “get the f--- up” off the floor.  When given the opportunity to apologize, Representative Van Orden refused and claimed the pages were “defiling” the Capitol, an interesting choice of words for a man who stood shoulder to shoulder with insurrectionists outside the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Further, more recent reporting reveals that a witness to the incident has described Van Orden’s demeanor as “physically aggressive” toward the teenagers and that he was “screaming inches from the pages’ faces. ” This is a deeply disturbing account of the incident, and if these allegations are accurate, would indicate that Representative Van Orden engaged in potentially abusive behavior, including verbal harassment and physical intimidation, against a group of minors on Capitol grounds.

If the widely shared reports are accurate, Representative Van Orden’s behavior toward the pages on July 26 was completely unacceptable and further calls into question his fitness for office. It is critical that members of the public, including his constituents in Wisconsin’s Third Congressional District, know the truth of what happened that evening. As the Chairman of the House Committee on Administration, you have already provided security footage to members of the public, including the media. In fact, in February of this year you provided over 44,000 hours of Capitol surveillance footage from the insurrection on January 6, 2021 to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and stated at the time that the move was made in an effort to be transparent and that “this majority is focused on accountability, transparency and restoring the People’s trust. ”

Representative Van Orden’s constituents deserve to know the truth about the man elected to serve them and releasing this footage would provide much-needed transparency into this potentially very disturbing incident. Therefore, given your past demonstrated support for transparency and the serious nature of the allegations surrounding Representative Van Orden’s threatening behavior toward a group of minors, I call on you to immediately release the security footage from inside the Capitol Rotunda on the evening of July 26 and early morning hours of July 27, 2023.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Mark PocanMember of Congress

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ritchie Torres (NY-15),House Judiciary Committee Ranking MemberJerrold Nadler (NY-10),and House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Ranking MemberPramila Jayapal (WA-07)led 57 Members in a letter to DHS Secretary Mayorkas and USCIS Director Jaddou expressing concerns about the affirmative asylum application backlog at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and urging them to bolster efforts to address the backlog.

In the letter, Members of Congress state:

“As you are aware, since January 2018, USCIS has been processing asylum applications under a “last in, first out” (LIFO) approach. Except for a three-year period when USCIS briefly switched to a “first in, first out” policy, LIFO has been the approach that USCIS has used to process affirmative asylum applications for more than 25 years. As a result of LIFO, 180,000 applications have been pending for more than five years. This has caused psychological distress, uncertainty and lengthy periods of family separation for people who have no hope of being scheduled for an asylum interview.”

The letter later requests that for each of the 10 asylum offices, DHS and USCIS:

• Commit to designating asylum officers to work “back to front” to address the backlog, giving those asylum seekers moved to the back of the line by the 2018 change to LIFO the opportunity to receive more timely decisions on their cases.
• Commit to a five-year “cutoff period,” after which time a pending application is moved to the front of the line, ensuring that applicants will not wait decades for an interview.

The letter further requests additional information from DHS and USCIS to better understand the current status of the asylum queue.

Title: Rep. Pocan, Sen. Murray Introduce Bicameral Bill to Improve Training For School Food Service Workers
Date: July 25, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. —Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced theImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Act, legislation to improve training for food service employees in schools. The legislation would assist in the implementation of existing professional standards for these workers by ensuring that training occurs during work hours and at no cost, and if training is unable to occur during scheduled work hours, the bill makes clear that employees must be informed in advance and compensated appropriately. Representatives Mark Pocan (D, WI-02) and Elise Stefanik (R, NY-21) are introducing companion, bipartisan legislation in the House today. Senator Murray first introduced the legislation last Congress.

“Food service workers do really essential work in our schools every day to make surekids can learn during the school day,”said Senator Murray.“Our legislation would make sure these workers get the best training available and that they aren’t being shortchanged for their time—common-sense fixes that will help our schools recruit and maintain a professional and skilled foodservice workforce.”

“Nutritious meals are as important to a child’s development as learning to read,”said Rep. Mark Pocan,“and school food service workers play a vital role in guaranteeing every child gets the healthy food they deserve. TheImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Actwill make it easier for workers to complete needed training and ensure food service workers have the skills to safely serve our kids. I’m proud to sponsor this critical bill with colleagues from across the aisle and in the Senate because good food and good jobs should be a part of 21st-century schools.”

“When our students are hungry, they can’t learn. The dedicated food service professionals who prepare and serve school meals are committed to providing all students with the healthy meals that set the stage for learning and participation, and they need appropriate training for the expertise required,”said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association.“TheImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Actwill help ensure that our food service professionals have access to training sessions during their paid work days or are compensated if the training has to occur outside of work hours to ensure our students are getting the healthy, nutritious meals they need to thrive.”

The reauthorization of theHealthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010enacted professional standards for food service workers. These standards worked to ensure that school meals are as healthy as possible for students. TheImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Actbuilds on these standards and would:

• Ensure that training sessions occur primarily during regular, paid working hours;
• Compensate workers for training sessions that must occur outside of work hours;
• Make every effort to inform workers of training sessions that must take place outside of work hours;
• Ensure that school food service workers are not penalized if they are unable to attend training sessions outside of work hours; and
• Promote in-person, hands-on training whenever possible and appropriate.

WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), and Andrew Garbarino (NY-02) and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Roger Marshall (R-KS)introduced the “Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act,” bipartisan and bicameral legislation which would reauthorize Helen Keller National National Center for DeafBlind Youth and Adults (HKNC) for five years through 2028.

HKNC provides essential vocational training and rehabilitation to the DeafBlind community across the United States. The Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act would allow for Congress to continue funding the Center from 2024 through 2028 by means of the Appropriations process.

“The Helen Keller National Center has a long history of supporting DeafBlind people nationwide, providing them with opportunities to take an active role in their local communities,”said Representative Pocan.“For over 50 years, the Center has been an invaluable resource and solid foundation for DeafBlind Americans across the nation and in my home state of Wisconsin. I’m proud to join my colleagues and lead this effort to reauthorize the Center for five more years so this beneficial work can continue to shape the lives of so many.”

“The Helen Keller National Center, headquartered on Long Island, provides essential rehabilitation and vocational training to members of the DeafBlind community across the country,”said Representative Garbarino.“With the help of the HKNC, DeafBlind Americans are able to receive the support, training, and resources to achieve their goals and thrive as productive members of society. I am proud to support the funding of the HKNC once again and I thank Congressman Pocan and Senator Gillibrand for their leadership on this issue.”

“For over 50 years, the Helen Keller National Center has provided critical support services and resources to the DeafBlind community in New York and across the country,”said Senator Gillibrand.“I’m proud to work with my colleagues in this effort to reauthorize this vital center and ensure that members of the DeafBlind community continue to receive the support to fully participate in their communities.”

"I admire the important work that the Helen Keller National Center is doing to empower our deaf and blind community in Kansas and across the country. The HKNC does an excellent job providing crucial resources and services to help each member achieve their dreams,"Senator Marshall said."Our bipartisan legislation reauthorizes these centers and provides much-needed certainty to the members of the HKNC.”

Since it was first authorized by Congress in 1967, HKNC has established national services with regional offices based in California, Florida, Louisiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, Arizona, and Washington. It has additionally created two Community Services programs in New York and California and has deployed 12 DeafBlind Employment Specialist positions across the country that provide additional assistance and support to DeafBlind persons in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan/Ohio, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, and Arkansas. HKNC has also deployed three Youth services Coordinators in Utah, New York, and Illinois. HKNC’s goal is to deploy 20 DeafBlind Employment Specialists (two in each region) and to establish two additional Community Service Programs.

HKNC is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referral, support, and training exclusively to youths and adults who have combined vision and hearing loss. The Center also supports the families and professionals who work with the DeafBlind community.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the House passed a resolution supporting the State of Israel, which he supported:

“This resolution is aspirational: it embodies what Israel wants to be and what we hope it is. But if we want to make this vision a reality, then as friends of Israel, we must point out the significant barriers to those aspirations – as any good friend would.

“We must recognize that the expansion of illegal settlements, settler terrorism, and inhumane conditions in Gaza make meaningful peace elusive, as do rocket attacks against Israelis by extremists in Gaza.  I believe the best thing the United States can do to support Israel and Palestine and work toward peace in the region would be for the State Department to appoint a Special Envoy, with deep roots in both communities, who can bring the parties together to find a path towards peace.

“Israel is a friend of the United States. Criticism of the Israeli government and their actions is not antisemitism – it’s real and honest friendship."==

WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Jim McGovern (MA-02)sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken requesting him to call for the release of five political prisoners in El Salvador and for their charges to be dismissed. This comes after the January 2023 arrests of the five community leaders from northern El Salvador. There are strong indications that these arrests are politically motivated and intended to silence the overwhelming opposition to mining in the country.

“We write to express our serious concerns regarding the January 11, 2023 arrest of five

community leaders from northern El Salvador who were among the Water Defenders who led the successful effort to pass a historic law prohibiting metals mining in El Salvador in 2017,”the lawmakers wrote."There are strong indications that the current Salvadoran government intends to repeal that law and we are concerned these arrests are politically motivated and intended to silence the overwhelming opposition to mining in the country. We also have concerns that these men have been denied their basic right to due process. Therefore, we strongly urge you to send a clear, public message calling for their release from pre-trial detention and for the charges against the accused to be dismissed.”

The lawmakers continued,“In recent years, the Salvadoran government has taken several steps that indicate a desire to repeal the landmark 2017 metals mining ban. The five Water Defenders began to speak out against these steps last year, and in January 2023, were suddenly arrested and charged with a decades-old alleged crime. The Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office requested and obtained complete secrecy for the proceedings. However, information from the prosecution’s statements in the days immediately following the arrests indicates there is likely very little evidence to connect the Water Defenders to the alleged crimes.”

Reps. Pocan and McGovern were joined by 15 of their Democratic colleagues on the letter, and the full text can be foundhere.==
Title: Pocan Derides Nearly $1 Trillion NDAA

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after House passage of the $874 billion FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill he has never voted in favor of since being elected to Congress:

“It’s time to say ‘enough.’ Year after year, we spend more and more on our national defense – it’s too much with too little accountability. We have troops on food stamps while at the same time, price-gouging defense contractors are getting richer by the day.

“This entire process from House Republicans has been a sham. They have done away with all norms and stripped all bipartisanship from this bill. They didn’t allow debate on amendments from Democrats, including mine to cut the overall Pentagon budget by $100 billion, a fraction of the overall budget which could help address domestic priorities like housing, education, affordable healthcare, and more.  Moreover, this bill was littered with poison pill riders that attack the LGBTQ+ community, restrict access to abortion, and gut efforts to improve Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the military, undermining our national security and putting our troops in harm's way. I’ll continue to fight to ensure these provisions never become law.”

The House did adopt an amendment offered by Rep. Pocan to require the Pentagon to report to Congress detailing the progress made to date in its ongoing efforts to pass an audit, and outlining the remaining challenges and outstanding requirements to achieving a clean audit opinion.

However, Republicans refused to allow debate on a number of other priorities supported by Rep. Pocan, including the amendment to cut the topline funding level by $100 billion, as well as several others that would:

• Improve cost and pricing data transparency in government contracts,
• Require the Departments of Defense and State to report on illegal settlement activity in the West Bank,
• Require the Department of Defense to report on the potential health effects of exposure to jet noise, including from F-35 aircraft, and
• Prohibit discrimination in the military and ensure that standards for eligibility for service and equality of treatment and opportunity in service may not include any criteria relating to protected categories and gender.

The FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed the House with a vote of 219-210. The Senate will consider their version later this month.==
Title: Pocan, Casar Introduce Food Worker Pay Standards Act
Date: July 11, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)andGreg Casar (TX-35)introduced the Food Worker Pay Standards Act, which would ensure that the federal government only purchases food produced by workers who earn fair pay and benefits.

The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor to use local wages and benefits for food production workers in conjunction with local collective bargaining agreements to establish a regional prevailing wage and would prevent the federal government from purchasing food produced by workers paid less than those prevailing rates. This standard would apply to meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, and processed food workers.

“The federal government should not be in the business of rewarding companies with taxpayer-funded contracts if they aren’t adequately paying or protecting their workers,”said Rep. Mark Pocan.“Food processing is one of our country’s most dangerous industries and one that relies heavily on workers from marginalized communities. The time is long overdue to protect these vulnerable workers with federal guardrails. This bill tells food processing companies that the government is only willing to work with businesses that put workers first. Anything less will not be funded by the American people.”

“Every single worker – no matter the industry or occupation – is entitled to just wages and safe working conditions,”said Rep. Greg Casar."We can make sure that we’re doing business with companies that are paying fair wages. That way, the federal government is helping create an economy that works for all of us, not just a privileged few. It’s time for Congress to pass the Food Worker Pay Standards Act and support workers employed in one of our country’s most dangerous industries.”

Food production and processing workers face dangerous conditions and federal contracting should not undermine the high standards that workers have secured through bargaining with their employers. Animal slaughtering and processing workers suffer injury and illness at more thantwice the rateof other workers. Federal contracts should improve – not undermine – wages and benefits for workers.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)introduced a resolution honoring the 85th anniversary of the National Treasury Employees Union.

NTEU has long been at the forefront of improving the lives and livelihoods of federal workers fighting for better working conditions, benefits, protections, and opportunities. It now represents 150,000 workers employed by 34 federal agencies.

“As a card-carrying union member,”said Rep. Pocan,“I believe every worker, no matter their employer, should have the opportunity to be represented by a union. NTEU members carry out essential functions of our government and are effective advocates for fair pay and benefits. To the workers of the NTEU, congratulations on your 85th anniversary!”

Founded in Wisconsin in 1938, the Union was established to advocate for civil service protections for revenue collectors and prevent political influence in the revenue collection workforce.==
Title: Pocan Votes Against GOP Hostage-Taking Debt Ceiling Bill
Date: May 31, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, released the following statement after he voted against the Bipartisan Budget Bill:

“For months, I have been calling on Speaker McCarthy to put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor to avoid bringing our nation to the brink of an unnecessary economic catastrophe, just as we did three times under President Trump and 78 times since 1960. Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.

“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.

“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.

“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.

“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)andGwen Moore (WI-04)released the following statements after Representative Bryan Steil (WI-01) and the Republican caucus adjourned the House of Representatives for the long weekend without a debt limit deal in place, risking default on the United States and damage to the US economy:"When Rep. Steil voted for the Default on America Act last month, he voted to force a draconian 22% cut on government programs and services, like Meals on Wheels, opioid addiction services, and local police grants, effectively defunding the police,"Rep. Pocan said. "When House Republicans released four of their appropriations bills earlier this month, those cuts could now be as high as 30 percent. This is an extreme position and hardly leading in a responsible way. I urge Bryan to sign the discharge petition to force a vote on a clean debt limit. After that, then we can talk about spending levels in the normal appropriations process. But damaging the US economy by inaction is not a reasonable position for anyone to have.""I am so disappointed in my colleague, Rep. Bryan Steil,"Rep. Moore said. "As the representative of my birthplace and Wisconsin's First District, I had high hopes. He is young and intelligent and prides himself on delivering for Wisconsin families, yet he embraces the old, stagnant ideas of the Republican party. Sadly, he is now engaging in a dangerous partisan game that threatens the nation's credit rating, American jobs, and our strong economic recovery. Why does he want to default on the nation's debt? As Chairman of the House Administration and the ‘Mayor of Capitol Hill,' he should show leadership and courage by signing the discharge petition."

All 213 House Democrats signed a discharge petition to lift the debt limit cleanly. Democrats need only five rational and reasonable Republicans to do this or risk a catastrophic default on the United States' economy. Unfortunately, Rep. Steil supported his Republican leadership to adjourn the House for the long weekend without signing the discharge petition.

Rep. Steil and his Republican colleagues are holding the country hostage, risking default for a 30 percent cut to most services that help nearly everyone in his district and across Wisconsin.

Rep. Steil's 30 percent cuts would hurt Wisconsin by:

• Cutting 190 Rail Safety Inspections in Wisconsin.
• Eliminating 7,000 Preschool and Child Care Slots in Wisconsin.
• Worsening Social Security and Medicare Assistance Wait Times for 1.4 million Wisconsin Seniors.
• Denying 440 Wisconsinites Access to Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.
• Gutting Funding for 380,000 Low-Income Students.
• Cutting Support for 120,000 Students with Disabilities.
• Making College More Expensive for 86,100 Wisconsinites.
• Denying 14,000 Wisconsinites Access to Workforce Development Services.

Van Orden voted for the Default on America Act last month, he voted to force a draconian 22% cut on government programs and services, like Meals on Wheels, vital dairy subsidies, and housing vouchers for veterans, effectively kicking homeless veterans to the curb,"Rep. Pocan said."When House Republicans released four of their appropriations bills earlier this month, those cuts could now be as high as 30 percent. This is an extreme position and hardly leading in a responsible way. I urge Derrick to sign the discharge petition to force a vote on a clean debt limit. After that, then we can talk about spending levels in the normal appropriations process. But damaging the US economy by inaction is not a reasonable position for anyone to have.""After being on U.S. Capitol grounds during the attempted insurrection on January 6th, I would think that Rep. Derrick Van Orden would want to take this opportunity to demonstrate to the people of Wisconsin that he will put their interests first,"Rep. Moore said."He must go beyond his rhetoric and sign the discharge petition to help end the debt ceiling crisis his party created."

All 213 House Democrats signed a discharge petition to lift the debt limit cleanly.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)was appointed by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08) to a new task force on Agriculture and Nutrition. The Task Force will lay the groundwork for House Democrats' priorities in the upcoming Farm Bill reauthorization."The Farm Bill is one of the most vital pieces of legislation Congress must pass, and every five years it's a debate between big agriculture vs. local farmers and nutrition assistance vs. draconian work requirements,"Rep. Pocan said."Wisconsin farmers have been hit hard by the pandemic and corporate mergers, impacting our rural communities, food security, farmers' livelihoods, and even how our food is grown. The next Farm Bill should protect local farmers and rural communities from greedy corporate interests and provide strong support for food assistance, including Meals on Wheels and SNAP, which is the number one program that keeps kids out of poverty. I will use my voice on this Task Force to fight for South Central Wisconsin farmers and their families. I am humbled by this appointment by Leader Jeffries and look forward to joining Chairman Thompson on this Task Force.""In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, no one in America should go hungry,"said Leader Jeffries."Unfortunately, extreme MAGA Republicans in the House continue to relentlessly attack essential programs that address food insecurity among children and older Americans like SNAP, WIC and Meals on Wheels. This task force will help lead the way to push back aggressively. Equally significant, the task force will continue to honor our commitment to the farmers that feed our nation. From crop insurance to commodities and trade, agriculture policy forms an important pillar of our economy. We must ensure that our farmers have the resources needed to thrive in the 21st century. The Members appointed come from nearly every corner of our nation and bring a wide range of experience on both agriculture and nutrition issues. I am appreciative that Rep. Bennie Thompson has agreed to Chair the task force and will bring his leadership experience and policy expertise to this important work."

Pocan will serve on the task force alongside Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Lou Correa (D-Calif.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Josh Harder (D-Calif.), Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), and Kim Schrier (D-Wash.).==

WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Pete Sessions (TX-17), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC), and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05)reintroduced theWords Matter Act, bipartisan legislation that updates the U.S. Code by removing the more than two dozen instances of "mentally retarded" from federal law, replacing the outdated language with terminology befitting both the 21st Century and human dignity."This bill just makes sense,"Congressman Pocan said."Federal law should reflect the time in which we live and not include harmful words or slurs. The Words Matter Act will modernize our laws, and remove offensive language from the U.S. Code. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for joining this effort to update our laws in a manner that is respectful of every American. I look forward to this bill's immediate passage so we can retire this language once and for all.""I am the proud father of a Down syndrome young adult and Eagle Scout,"Congressman Sessions said."Those who know my son regard him as an able, loving, and accomplished young man, whose abilities far outnumber his disabilities. I am confident that the ‘Words Matter Act' will bring us one step closer to ushering our U.S. Code into the present. While this change is long past due, I am pleased to be a lead co-sponsor of this bi-partisan legislation which amends dated language to ‘intellectual disability' for federal laws. Those with Down syndrome are a blessing from God and deserve to be respected as such.""My oldest son Cole has Down syndrome. From the day he was born, I watched as others tried to limit his potential. But Cole has refused to let his extra 21st chromosome define him, defying his doubters at every turn,"said Congresswoman Rodgers."In America, we are not defined by the condition of our birth, and it's well-past time the text of our nation's laws reflect that. The use of outdated and derogatory language in previously written law fails to treat individuals with disabilities with the dignity and respect they deserve. I'm confident the Words Matter Act will prove that our country knows better by bringing the laws of our land into the 21st century and setting a new standard for the way we speak about others in America.""Words indisputably matter, and I'm proud to be a lead cosponsor of Rep. Pocan's bill,"Congresswoman Norton said."My own daughter, Katherine, has Down syndrome. I'm appalled at the thought of someone using the word ‘retarded' toward her, and it is inexcusable that the word is still part of the U.S. Code. Our country is better than this, as passage of Rep. Pocan's bill will show."

The 111th Congress Congress struck "mental retardation" from federal law via "Rosa's Law" (P.L. 111-256), which passed the House by voice vote and the Senate by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, it did not strike the equally offensive term "mentally retarded" which this bill will do, bringing federal law into the 21st Century.

Words Matter Act Cosponsors Include (33):Blumenauer, Budzinski, Castor, DeSaulnier, Doggett, Duncan, Evans, Fitzpatrick, C. Garcia, Grijalva, Houchin, Kaptur, Keating, Langworthy, Letlow, McCollum, McGarvey, McMorris Rodgers, Molinaro, Moskowitz, K.

Washington, D.C.—Today, Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Michael Burgess (R-TX), and Andy Biggs (R-AZ) introduced theAudit the Pentagon Act of 2023, which aims to increase transparency and accountability in the defense budget.

As of November 2022, the Pentagon has failed its 5th consecutive audit.According to arecent GAO report, the Department of Defense (DOD) continues to be unable to account for billions of dollars' worth of assets.

This bipartisan legislation would administer a 0.5% cut to the budget of any office at the Pentagon that does not receive an audit for the first year of the bill's enactment, then rises to 1.0% in subsequent years. The bill exempts funding for personnel, families, and military health care from these automatic cuts."We cannot justify continuing to increase the Pentagon budget when the agency cannot even successfully pass an audit,"said Congressman Pocan."This bill will provide a powerful incentive to Pentagon leaders to get their fiscal house in order. DoD has a history of little accountability while pouring billions into weapons systems that just don't work properly. It's past time to rein in spending on ineffective programs and restore fiscal discipline to the Pentagon.""The lack of accountability and transparency at the Pentagon is simply outrageous. Congress pours trillions of taxpayer dollars into the Pentagon, but we still have no clear idea how that money is being spent,"said Congresswoman Lee. "The Pentagon's inability to responsibly manage billions of taxpayer dollars allocated every year is unacceptable. Our bipartisan coalition of Representatives Burgess, Pocan, and Biggs are committed to finally holding the Pentagon accountable to the American taxpayer.""As stewards of taxpayer dollars, it is our responsibility to demand transparency and accountability from all government agencies, including the Department of Defense,"said Rep. Burgess."It is unacceptable that the DoD has yet to complete a full financial audit, unlike other major agencies. While some progress has been made, more needs to be done to ensure that the DoD is fully compliant with the law. By incentivizing a full audit and reducing funding for unauditable departments, we can hold the DoD accountable and ensure proper oversight. Our duty to the American people requires no less.""The Pentagon has been on a wild spending spree and it's long past time to bring accountability and enhanced oversight over its spending habits,"said Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ).The Pentagon's aimless spending approach impacts all American taxpayers—regardless of their political affiliation. I'm grateful for my colleagues across the aisle for joining me to hold the Pentagon better in check."

This legislation is supported by national organizations including Win Without War, Public Citizen, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and FreedomWorks and R Street.

MADISON, WI – Yesterday, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan and U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway to visit the Salvation Army of Dane County to highlight a $4 million federal investment to help build a new emergency shelter, affordable housing units, and community center for women and children experiencing homelessness.Senator Baldwin and Representative Pocan secured the funds as part of the bipartisan 2023 federal funding bill. The new shelter and community center are part of a $50 million, two-building campus that includes a multi-family apartment complex with affordable housing units. This campus will provide emergency housing for families and people who identify as female, and wrap-around services – such as medical respite for those needing care, mental health programs, and connecting people to permanent housing —to help end cyclical homelessness."Too many of our friends and neighbors struggle to find affordable housing, forcing many to experience housing insecurity and homelessness, and it's just not right. Housing insecurity and homelessness have lasting impacts on our mental and physical health, economic stability and sense of security, especially for children,"said Senator Baldwin."That's why I was proud to deliver this $4 million investment with Congressman Pocan that will expand access to affordable housing, emergency and safe shelter, and the wrap-around services that people need to help end the cycle of homelessness.""I'm pleased that Senator Baldwin and I were able to use the Congressional appropriations process to secure a $4 million grant to build a new emergency shelter and community center here in Madison,"said Representative Pocan."It's wonderful to see Community Project Funding heading to the Salvation Army to ensure families have a safe place to stay as they transition to permanent housing.""The Salvation Army is grateful to receive this grant for the construction of the new shelter,"said Major Andrew Shiels, Salvation Army Capital Area Coordinator."The Salvation Army Capital Area Command's goal is to improve living conditions, health, and economic well-being and provide safe shelter for those in the Dane County community. Families searching for a safe, secure place to stay rely on us for care and support while they get back on their feet. The $4 million grant spearheaded by Senator Baldwin and Representative Pocan demonstrates a commitment from our elected officials to create a stronger community here in Madison."

The City partnered with the Salvation Army to create a safe and comfortable space for families experiencing homelessness at the old Karmenta facility, and is in discussions with the agency about purchasing their current site in the Darbo Worthington neighborhood, contributing capital funding for the East Washington project."Serving women and children experiencing homelessness is a critical service for the Madison community,"said Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway."I'm grateful to Senator Baldwin and Congressman Pocan for joining the City in supporting the Salvation Army's work to create a new shelter to serve this vulnerable population."==

Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Congressional Equality Caucus Chair

Today Republicans are showing their real priorities, political priorities, by considering a trans and intersex sports ban as the opening salvo in their efforts to undermine the rights of LGBTQI+ people. Young people participate in sports, to be part of a team to learn sportsmanship and to challenge themselves. Their sports ban seeks to strip trans girls of all ages and intersex students of these opportunities. Look, there are real pressing problems impacting women's and girls' sports, including sexual harassment and assault, lack of equal resources and pay inequality. And there are pressing problems facing the kids of our nation including nearly 50,000 gun deaths a year including more than 4,700 involving kids. But rather than addressing any of those issues, anti-equality politicians on the Education and Workforce Committee will spend their first legislative markup targeting a handful of trans girls and women who participate in school sports.

When it comes to protecting women's sports, we should look to leading women's sports and gender justice organizations like Women's Sports Foundation, and the National Women's Law Center. Both organizations, as well as leading women athletes, support transgender inclusion in sports. Major athletic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, and the NCAA have guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes. And those bodies reject the type of systematic exclusion of transgender people from sports that anti-LGBTQI+ politicians are pushing. This is part of a larger, coordinated attack against transgender people and the larger gay community.

We've seen hundreds of anti-equality bills, with many specifically targeting transgender people introduced in states across the country this year. Unfortunately, this is about building the personal brand of some extreme right-wing politicians; people who fundraise from an appeal to a small subset of their political base. These bullying politicians will endanger the lives of trans kids for their own political purposes with the support of the GOP leadership. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Not one person in Republican leadership called out the comments by a conservative speaker at CPAC last week who called for the eradication of transgender people. Look, this isn't about sports. This is about attacking trans and other LGBTQI plus kids, and the politics of the issue, not the substance of letting kids play. And that's heartless, and cruel, and very wrong.

There will be few pages assigned to future chapters ofProfiles in Couragefor the politicians that bully kids for their own gain. And that's exactly what this is about today. We are really pleased to be joined by a few folks who are going to offer some really strong expertise and talking about this. In just a minute you're going to hear from Shiwali Patel, who's the Senior Counsel at the National Women's Law Center, you're going to hear from a student athlete, Rebekah Bruesehoff. And you're going to hear from her mother, Jamie, who are going to talk about how this impacts real families, as unfortunately too many extreme MAGA politicians are busy lining their campaign coffers and appealing to a political base. So with that, I'd like to introduce Shewali Patel from the National Women's Law Center.

Shewali Patel, Director of Justice for Student Survivors & Senior Counsel at the National Women's Law Center

Thank you, I'm Shewali Patel, a Title IX civil rights attorney at the National Women's Law Center, where I work every day to ensure that women's and girls' civil rights are strongly protected in schools. And I'm honored to be here alongside Rebekah and her mother Jamie and Chair Pocan to express the Law Center's strong opposition to efforts to ban transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. These efforts seek to deny trans athletes access to the many benefits; to emotional, social, and physical and academic wellbeing that participation in sports offer.

Transphobic laws and policies turn Title IX and the critical protections it offers against sex discrimination and education on its head. The Law Center was founded the same year the Title IX was enacted just over 50 years ago, and since then, we have been fighting against sex discrimination in education, including in school sports. And today we're paying close attention to the attacks against transgender, nonbinary and intersex students through hateful federal and state legislation, including the GOP's bill H.R. 734, which is about to go into markup.

While this bill is framed as protecting women's and girls' sports, we know what it really is. It's a bigoted and discriminatory attempt to target an already marginalized group, rather than address real barriers to gender equity and sports. This bill and other bills across the country like it are intentionally misleading when invoking women and girls' rights because they really seek to exclude trans women and girls from sports. It's also very telling that these bills are pushed by groups who haven't actually fought to protect women's and girls' rights in sports and elsewhere. There are actual well-documented barriers to athletics that women and girls face, including less funded and resourced teams, inadequate facilities and equipment. unequal pay for women's athletes and coaches, and rampant sexual abuse of student athletes. But these bills and H.R. 734 doesn't address those issues. And yet proponents of these sports bans continue to and wrongly claim that allowing trans athletes to compete will harm cisgender women and girls, but this divide and conquer tactic gets it exactly wrong.

Excluding women and girls who are trans hurts us all. It invites gender policing that could subject any women or girl to invasive medical test, and accusations of being too masculine or too good at their sport to be real women or girls. It subjects athletes to humiliating practices to determine their sex and makes them vulnerable to sexual abuse by being forced into sex verification procedures that may include gynecological exams or other procedures. It harms women and girls who fall outside of stereotypical notions of femininity, and especially black and brown women and girls, given racist standards of what is considered feminine. As a national women's rights organization, we have always been clear that transgender girls are girls who should have the right to participate in athletics and other school programs and activities consistent with their gender identity.

Trans and intersex girls and women have been playing school sports for many years, and yet they have not been dominating their peers. There's no evidence of it. In fact, allowing trans athletes to participate in sports correlates with increased participation by all girls. But in states that enacted trans exclusionary policies in sports, girls' overall participation in high school sports actually declined. And despite all this fear mongering from extremist lawmakers, boys are not pretending to be girls to dominate in school sports that just isn't happening. Yet unfortunately, politicians acting in bad faith are using trans women and girls as political pawns to perpetuate their hateful agenda.

The truth is like any other girl or woman, sometimes trans women and girls lose at their game, and sometimes they win. And when they win, we celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate their wins. Banning certain students from sports merely because of who they are doesn't promote fairness, or safety for women and girls. But H.R. 734 would mandate discriminatory exclusion for every age, every sport and level of competition gatekeeping which women and girls get a chance to play and clearly violating Title IX's mandate of equal educational opportunity. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

Rebekah Bruesehoff, Trans Student Athlete and Activist

Hi, my name is Rebekah. I'm a 16-year-old high school sophomore who actually loves school. I'm a straight A Honors student. I have a solo in the spring musical. French toast is my favorite food. I'm a pastor's kid and a big sister to two brothers who can be really annoying sometimes, and I still love them. I also happen to be transgender. I've been living as my authentic self for eight years. That's over half my life. I started playing field hockey when I was 10 years old, and I fell in love. It's fun, full of speed and excitement and getting to hit a ball with a stick. Who doesn't love that? But seriously, it's one of the hardest and most rewarding things I do.

Field Hockey gives me so much – confidence, strength, and a place to belong. For me, it's not just my sport, it's my community. Through field hockey, I learned how hard work and perseverance can help you make a real-time difference. That translates to everything I do in life. I've had incredible coaches and wonderful teammates. There's never been a question of whether I belonged, whether it's on or off the field. We take care of each other.

I should be in chemistry class right now. But I'm here to tell you that kids like me should get to play sports with their friends. Honestly, that feels super absurd when I say it out loud yet, that's what's happening here. Either been speaking out about the right of kids like me to play sports for over two years, I've watched with my friends and other states have had t their right to play debated and legislated. But I live in New Jersey. I live in New Jersey, where I thought I was safe, where everyone said I was safe. I don't understand why lawmakers insist on bullying kids who just want to play.

Sports are one of the most American experiences in any childhood, a federal sports ban would alienate me from my community, and prevent me from continuing to become a better version of myself. It would limit access to essential life skills that we want all kids to have, like grit, determination, and learning to work with others towards a common goal. I've been raised and taught by my parents, coaches, and teachers to be the kind of person who works actively to include people. Make sure no one eats alone in the lunchroom, and who stands up to bullies. That's what I'm doing here.

Trans kids are a part of every community across the country. We aren't going anywhere; we will keep standing up together. And we all deserve a chance to be kids and to play.

Jamie Bruesehoff, Parent & Advocate

My name is Jamie Bruesehoff and my husband Chris here and I are the proud parents of three children, including Rebecca. There are many things that make Rebecca special; her smile, her laugh, the way she cares deeply about the world. Being transgender is the least remarkable thing about her.And as a family of faith, we believe that God created her to be exactly who she is. When I think about what I want for my children, it's what most parents want. I want them to grow into functioning adults who positively contribute to society, are active in their community, and experience joy. I want them to learn how to fall down and get back up to take care of each other and the people around them.

Sports, unlike anything else, teaches them how to do those things. That's why parents all over the country commit to getting our kids to practice; washing uniforms, cutting up orange slices, and sitting all day in the bleachers where we're either freezing or getting sunburned. We all do it because we know getting to play the game they love makes our kids not just better teammates, but better human beings. But when I'm watching Rebecca play, I'm not just holding my breath hoping her team makes the next goal. I'm wondering when what's happening to kids in Texas is going to happen to Rebecca and our family.

To be categorically excluded from being a full member of her school community in this way would impact every part of her life and separate her not just from her peers, but the coaches and mentors helping her grow into the best version of herself. The idea that lawmakers would spend more time debating whether our daughter gets to play with her friends than they would protecting her from school shootings and gun violence is outrageous. Plenty of things would make school safer for youth and allow all kids a better educational experience. Keeping trans youth for and playing with their peers is not one of them.

Hundreds of thousands of families like mine are simply raising our children, like all families. And yet we find ourselves here defending our children from a radical political agenda that we've seen in state houses across America, and now making its way into Congress.

Politicians are trying to control how Chris and I parent, to legislate how we raise our kids. The terroristic nature of this kind of legislation impacts our families every day. They are censoring and surveilling our homes, our classrooms, and our doctor's offices. This isn't just about sports and trans kids. This is an attempt to dictate what an American family looks like. And American families can and do look like mine. All kids deserve a chance to be kids and to grow into thriving adults they are meant to be.==

This year Public Schools Week is February 27 to March 3, and it serves as a time to celebrate the achievements of our public schools and honor the significant contributions and accomplishments of students, parents, educators, and education advocates.

“As a public school graduate from kindergarten through college, I’m proud to recognize the 9 out of every 10 students in America that attend a public school,”Rep. Mark Pocan said.“I am committed to strengthening our public schools so that every child receives a high-quality education experience. Communities are stronger and schools are better when we all work together to support public education. Our shared future and our success depend on the support we give to public education today.”

“America’s public schools have a long and storied tradition of preparing our children to become tomorrow’s leaders,”Rep. Sam Graves said.“Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, I’m a proud product of the public school system.

As a policymaker and former public school parent, I am eternally grateful for the tireless dedication of our many teachers and school staff. I'm committed to making sure schools have the policies and resources they need to provide a quality education to all students.”

“National Public Schools Week celebrates the storied history and success of our public school system and the education it provides to our youth,”Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson said.“As a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee, and an alumnus of public schools, I am well aware of the vital role schools play in their communities. Every child deserves access to a high-quality education so that they may learn and grow. We must continue to strengthen these institutions so we can better prepare our next generation of learners.”

During Public Schools Week, national education groups representing teachers, principals, superintendents, parents, civil rights and disability advocates, and religious organizations highlight the importance of our public schools and the positive difference they make in shaping the future of our country. Public schools are open to every child – regardless of ability, wealth, country of origin, or needs, and by supporting public school systems we strengthen our country.

Title: Pocan, Doggett, Frost Introduce the Protect Social Security and Medicare Act
Date: February 2, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Lloyd Doggett (TX-37),andMaxwell Frost (FL-10), introduced the Protect Social Security and Medicare Act. This bill aims to prevent House Republicans from cutting Medicare and Social Security by raising the vote threshold to two-thirds in both the House and Senate for any legislation that would reduce benefits under either program."Medicare and Social Security are overwhelmingly popular for good reason – they provide critically important benefits to seniors and other vulnerable Americans. We all pay into both of these programs and are counting on them for essential healthcare and a dignified retirement,"said Congressman Pocan. "The Protect Social Security and Medicare Act will ensure that these benefits are protected from changes that lack widespread support.""This legislation would ensure that Republicans are not permitted to fulfill Newt Gingrich's desire of letting Social Security and Medicare ‘wither on the vine,'said Congressman Doggett. "With the ongoing Republican attempt to use the debt limit to extract cuts, this bill offers added protection for fulfilling our promise that every American worker can retire with dignity and security.""For millions of seniors and working people across Florida, Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline that means the difference between having the financial support and healthcare you need to live, or going without,"said Rep. Frost."After decades of bipartisan support for these critical programs, Republicans want to put them on the chopping block to pay for their tax cuts to the rich – but we won't let them. I refuse to turn my back on the seniors, disabled Floridians, and working families who depend on these programs and will fight to ensure cuts to Medicare and Social Security never see the light of day."

According to arecent pollby the Economist/YouGov, 70% of Americans oppose the brutal cuts proposed by House Republicans. The Washington Post described the GOP plans to rob seniors as "deeply unpopular." The Protect Social Security and Medicare Act aims to ensure that these benefits are protected from such cuts.

Endorsed by Social Security Works, the Protect Social Security and Medicare Act requires a two-thirds supermajority vote to pass any legislation that would reduce benefits under either program, protecting seniors' safety net from changes that lack widespread support.==
Title: Pocan, Khanna, Schakowsky Introduce Bill to Strengthen Medicare, Define Alternative Plans
Date: January 31, 2023
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –As we enter the second month of the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09)are reintroducing the "Save Medicare Act." This bill renames so-called "Medicare Advantage" plans, prohibits private insurers from using "Medicare" in plan titles or advertisements, and imposes significant fines for any insurer that engages in this deceptive practice.

Many cable news watchers have been inundated with commercials for private healthcare plans during this open enrollment period. Because of that, Reps. Pocan, Khanna, and Schakowskyfilmed a videoexplaining why Medicare Advantage is not Medicare."Only Medicare is Medicare. It is one of the most popular and important services the government provides,"Rep. Pocan said."These non-Medicare plans run by private insurers undermine traditional Medicare. They often leave patients without the benefits they need while overcharging the federal government for corporate profit. This bill eliminates any confusion about what is – and what is not – Medicare, and ensures this essential program will continue to serve seniors and other Americans for years to come.""It's time to call out ‘Medicare Advantage' for what it is: private insurance that profits by denying coverage and the name is being used to trick seniors into enrolling. That's not right,"said Rep. Khanna."This bill will end the scam by preventing private insurers from profiting off the Medicare brand. Our focus should be on strengthening and expanding real Medicare.""Do not be fooled, Medicare Advantage is not Medicare. I am extremely concerned about the deceptive advertisements that Medicare Advantage plans are using to trick older Americans into signing up for plans that may not cover the care they need. Not only are Medicare Advantage plans denying requests for much-needed care, but they are also falsifying medical records to make seniors appear sicker than they are so the plans can line their own pockets with taxpayer dollars,"said Rep. Schakowsky. "The Save Medicare Act, which I am proud to introduce with Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna, will help us put an end to the false advertising and will show the American people that these plans are scams.""So-called Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage,"said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. "It is simply another scheme by the insurance companies to line their pockets at the expense of consumers. I applaud Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna for introducing this vital legislation. The health care market is confusing for consumers and misleading branding like so-called Medicare Advantage just makes it worse.""Medicare is a national treasure, delivering real value to millions of older adults and people with disabilities,"Diane Archer, President of Just Care USA said. "Corporate insurance plans too often lean on Medicare's good name to mislead people into signing up with them. Rep. Pocan and Rep. Khanna's bill would put an end to this practice.""Signing up for the right Medicare coverage is a nightmare right now, a complex and tangled maze of choices,"Alex Lawson, Executive Director of Social Security Works said."The real problem is that a bunch of these choices aren't Medicare at all. They are private insurance companies preying on seniors and people with disabilities. Unlike actual Medicare, these plans deny and delay care — because that's what for-profit insurance always does. These corporate insurance plans should not be able to lie about who and what they are by calling themselves Medicare anything.""Private health insurers drive up costs and deny care to people who need it, and calling what they're up to ‘Medicare Advantage' doesn't change that fact,"People's Action Director Sulma Arias said. "This bill by Reps. Pocan, Khanna, and Schakowsky will stop these scams. The people organizing through our Our Health Care for All campaign are proud to support the Save Medicare Act. We need our elected officials to focus on expanding real Medicare to everyone, not lending its branding to greedy corporations."

According to aNew York Times articlepublished in October, "8 of the 10 largest Medicare Advantage insurers – representing more than two-thirds of the market – have submitted inflated bills…and four of the five largest players – United Health, Humana, Elevance, and Kaiser – have faced federal lawsuits alleging that efforts to overdiagnose their customers crossed the line into fraud."

Additionally, according to the federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission's2022 report to Congress, at least $12 billion in overpayments were made to Medicare Advantage plans in 2020 by the federal government.

The "Save Medicare Act" will eliminate the confusion private insurers have relied upon for years to enroll unsuspecting seniors, and restore true Medicare as the primary health plan older Americans rely on.

Title: Pocan’s 21st Century President Act Heads to President’s Desk
Date: December 21, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.– Last night,U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan's (WI-02)bill, the21st Century President Act(H.R. 3285), passed the United States Senate unanimously by voice vote. Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives also passed it unanimously by voice vote. The bill now heads to President Biden's desk where he is expected to sign it.

Pocan's bill would make commonsense updates to gendered language in the U.S. Code, reflecting the reality that a woman or LGBTQ+ person will someday hold the office of the presidency. Without this change, the law that makes it a crime to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President or the President's family would fail to explicitly include a future female president or president with a same-sex spouse."Federal law has finally caught up to times, specifically when it comes to who a future president can be,"said Representative Pocan."The last presidential election saw six women and one gay man in the Democratic presidential primary, but current federal law would have failed to fully protect them and their spouses if elected. We're closer than we've ever been to electing a woman, or someone with a spouse of the same sex, as president. Today, we've taken one more step toward guaranteed equal protection under the law, and I thank Senator Baldwin for her support in assisting its passage through the Senate."

18 U.S.C. 879 makes it a criminal act to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President, a former President, a candidate for President, or a member of their family, while referring to Presidents as men and to their spouses as wives. ​​The bipartisan 21st Century President Act would replace the terms "wife" and "widow" with "spouse," and replaces gender-specific pronouns referring to the President and presidential spouses with gender-neutral terms to extend full protection to anyone elected to become the president and first family.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Ahead of the Medicare Open Enrollment period,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Ro Khanna (CA-17)are introducing the "Save Medicare Act" to rename so-called "Medicare Advantage" plans, prohibit private insurers from using "Medicare" in plan titles or advertisements, and impose significant fines for any insurer that engages in this deceptive practice."Only Medicare is Medicare. It is one of the most popular and important services the government provides,"Rep. Pocan said."We should be working to expand this service to include coverage for dental, vision, and hearing care, as well as looking at ways to strengthen it rather than allowing these ‘Medicare Advantage' programs to provide pale alternatives to what Medicare does. These non-Medicare plans run by private insurers undermine traditional Medicare. They often leave patients without the benefits they need while overcharging the federal government for corporate profit. This bill eliminates any confusion about what is – and what is not – Medicare, and ensures this essential program will continue to serve seniors and other Americans for years to come.""‘Medicare Advantage' is just private insurance that profits by denying coverage and the name is being used to trick seniors into enrolling. That's not right,"said Rep. Khanna."This bill will prevent these private insurers from labeling themselves as ‘Medicare' and allow us to focus on strengthening and expanding real Medicare instead.""So-called Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage,"said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy."It is simply another scheme by the insurance companies to line their pockets at the expense of consumers. I applaud Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna for introducing this vital legislation. The health care market is confusing for consumers and misleading branding like so-called Medicare Advantage just makes it worse.""Medicare is a national treasure, delivering real value to millions of older adults and people with disabilities,"Diane Archer, Senior Advisor at Social Security Works and President of Just Care USA said."Corporate insurance plans too often lean on Medicare's good name to mislead people into signing up with them. Rep. Pocan and Rep. Khanna's bill would put an end to this practice."

According to a recentNew York Times article, "8 of the 10 largest Medicare Advantage insurers – representing more than two-thirds of the market – have submitted inflated bills…and four of the five largest players – United Health, Humana, Elevance, and Kaiser – have faced federal lawsuits alleging that efforts to overdiagnose their customers crossed the line into fraud."

Additionally, according to the federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission's2022 report to Congress, at least $12 billion in overpayments were made to Medicare Advantage plans in 2020 by the federal government.

The "Save Medicare Act" will eliminate the confusion private insurers have relied upon for years to enroll unsuspecting seniors, and restore true Medicare as the primary health plan older Americans rely on.

Title: Pocan Introduces Bills to Create National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture
Date: September 29, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – As the nation prepares to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus introduced two bills to begin the process of creating a National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture."As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations," Rep. Pocan said. "It is vital to remember our collective past – particularly when certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that harm LGBTQ+ youth and our community at large. Let's tell these stories, and honor the many contributions the LGBTQ+ community has made to this nation with a museum in Washington, D.C. I look forward to the passage of this legislation and to visiting this museum in the near future."

Rep. Pocan introduced bills to establish a commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. Both bills are required to be signed into law to create a new Smithsonian Museum.

The first bill creates an eight-member commission – consisting of individuals with various expertise in museum planning or LGBTQ+ research and culture – to look into the viability of establishing such a facility in the nation's Capital. The measure would require this commission to:

• Report recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture;
• Develop a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the museum through public contributions;
• Obtain an independent review of this fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the museum and its operations and maintenance without reliance on federal funds;
• Report on the availability and cost of acquiring collections for the museum, identify potential locations for the facility in Washington, D.C., and determine its regional impact on other museums; and,
• Submit to Congress a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the museum.

The bill would also direct the commission's recommendations to address whether the museum should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world's largest museum and research complex. The commission would have 18 months to complete the full study.

After the commission completes its work and issues its recommendations, Congress can consider the second bill to formally create the museum.

All 9 openly LGBTQ+ Members of Congress as well as 50 other members are sponsors of this legislation.==
Title: Pocan Introduces Constitutional Amendment Guaranteeing Right to Vote
Date: September 21, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)reintroduced legislation that would amend the Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to vote. At a time when voting rights are under attack nationwide, this amendment would provide all Americans of voting age the affirmative right to vote and further empower Congress to protect this fundamental right."Democracy works best when everyone participates,"said Rep. Pocan."Across the country, elected officials are attempting to disenfranchise voters and restrict access to the ballot box through any loophole they can find — all for their own political gain. The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy; it's too important to be left open to interpretation. A constitutional amendment would ensure every voice is heard and every vote counts the same. As one of the world's leading democracies, we must demand of ourselves what we demand of others: a guaranteed right to vote for all."

Pocan has introduced identical legislation every term since the 113th Congress, and is joined this year by 22 original cosponsors and 11 endorsing organizations."Our Constitution is in many ways an aspirational charter. And it is far from perfect,"Sarah E. Turberville, Director, The Constitution Project said."While it prohibits the government from denying the right to vote under numerous circumstances, the Supreme Court and policymakers across the country have exploited gaps in our founding document to suppress the right to vote in other nefarious ways. Congressman Pocan's resolution is an apolitical and obvious solution needed to ensure we have a democracy that is truly representative of the governed.""The right to vote is fundamental to a democracy,"Daniel Schuman, policy director, Demand Progress said."Our democracy has a long, unfortunate history of limits on that fundamental right in furtherance of granting political minorities the power to rule over political majorities. This cannot be tolerated and we cannot rely on the courts as a guarantor of this basic right. For now, and for all time, the right to vote must be enumerated in the Constitution and enforceable by an act of Congress.""Our democracy is built on the promise of one person, one vote. We applaud Congressman Pocan on his leadership and commitment to protecting that right with this amendment,"Tiffany Muller, President, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund said."Already enshrined in many state constitutions, a federal right to vote amendment will provide a national guarantee of the right of every eligible voter to participate in our elections. Affirming that right will ensure that voting is accessible, fair, and secure in every corner of the country,"said Rob Richie, President and CEO of FairVote,a nonpartisan organization seeking better elections for all. "This amendment comes at a particularly important time – a moment of great promise and peril for our republic, in which too many Americans are distrustful and dissatisfied with our elections and seek a better way forward.""Republicans are relentless and systematically working to chip away at the foundational right to vote and undermining our basic democratic principles,"said MoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting."As we anticipate the Republican-packed Supreme Court further stripping away voting rights protections, it is critical to continue fighting to enshrine people's right to vote – I am grateful to Congressman Pocan for his leadership on this important resolution.""This is simple. We fully endorse Rep. Mark Pocan's joint resolution, a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote,"said Pablo DeJesús, Executive Director, Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice."Unitarian Universalists want a healthy, inclusive democracy. We envision an America where all eligible voters participate, with ease, in the election of our leadership. Where every voice within our Nation is treated with dignity and valued, even in disagreement. Our foundation for this desire is clear. As a matter of faith, we uphold 'the inherent worth and dignity of every person.' We do so right alongside a belief in 'the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large.' We, therefore, endorse Rep. Pocan's constitutional amendment with our loudest voice and most fervent commitment to love and justice."

Endorsing Organizations Include:Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Demand Progress, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund, FairVote, Fix Democracy First, Indivisible, MoveOn, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, Project On Government Oversight, Sojourners, and Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice.

The full text of this resolution is as follows:

Section 1.Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.

Section 2.Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Tom Cole (OK-04), and Tom Suozzi (NY-03)led a bipartisan group of representatives to pass the "Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act," which would reauthorize Helen Keller National National Center for DeafBlind Youth and Adults (HKNC) for five years through 2027.

HKNC provides essential vocational training and rehabilitation to the DeafBlind community across the United States. The HKNC Reauthorization Act passed the House today and now heads to the Senate."The Helen Keller National Center has a long history of supporting DeafBlind people nationwide, providing them with opportunities to take an active role in their local communities,"said Pocan."For over 50 years, the Center has been an invaluable resource and solid foundation for DeafBlind Americans across the nation and in my home state of Wisconsin. I'm proud to join my colleagues and lead this effort to reauthorize the Center for five more years so this beneficial work can continue to shape the lives of so many.""To this day, the Helen Keller National Center for DeafBlind Youths and Adults is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referrals, support and training exclusively to Americans who have combined vision and hearing loss. The work the Center performs is essential and life changing for the people they are able to serve, and this work and this population deserves all our support,"said Chairman Robert C. "Bobby" Scott (VA-03), House Committee on Education and Labor."Following its passage in the House, I am very pleased that legislation to reauthorize the Helen Keller National Center for DeafBlind Youth and Adults is now one step closer to the finish line. For more than 50 years, the Center has admirably served DeafBlind communities and also supported those who care for and work with these individuals,"said Cole."Certainly, the Center's valuable mission, important work and role as a resource is worth affirming through reauthorization by Congress.""The Helen Keller National Center for DeafBlind Youths and Adults, which is located in my district, is unique in that it is the only organization of its kind nationwide that serves a population that is both deaf and blind. HKNC enables DeafBlind Americans to live, work, and thrive in our community,"said Suozzi."It is my privilege to support this legislation and do what I can to support and strengthen this organization, one that truly represents miracles in people's lives.""On behalf of Helen Keller National Center I would like to express a special thanks to Representative Pocan for championing the reauthorization of the HKNC Act,"said Susan Ruzenski, CEO of Helen Keller Services."By doing so, he has made visible to Congress a community that strives to realize their aspirations and has demonstrated time and time again that given access to quality services and opportunities they too can achieve self-actualized lives."

Since it was first authorized by Congress in 1967, HKNC has established national services with regional offices based in California, Florida, Louisiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, Arizona, and Washington. It has additionally created two Community Services programs in New York and California and has deployed 12 DeafBlind Employment Specialist positions across the country that provide additional assistance and support to DeafBlind persons in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan/Ohio, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, and Arkansas. HKNC has also deployed three Youth services Coordinators in Utah, New York, and Illinois. HKNC's goal is to deploy 20 DeafBlind Employment Specialists (two in each region) and to establish two additional Community Service Programs.

HKNC is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referral, support, and training exclusively to youths and adults who have combined vision and hearing loss. The Center also supports the families and professionals who work with the DeafBlind community.==

Title: Pocan, House Democrats Send Inflation Reduction Act to President’s Desk
Date: August 12, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. This legislation will lower the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, lower household energy bills, reduce health insurance premiums, and invest in American clean energy to take on the climate crisis — all while closing tax loopholes for big, billion-dollar corporations, making them pay their fair share."This is a huge deal," said Pocan. "Only one party is focused on putting people over politics, and this legislation is just the latest example of how stark that contrast is. As our world continues to recover from a global pandemic, Democrats worked to address some of the biggest needs facing our communities and our planet. This bill takes concrete steps to lower healthcare costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and capping out-of-pocket expenses for seniors. On top of that, the Inflation Reduction Act will save people money on energy costs, address the climate crisis, and close tax loopholes to ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share. I'm grateful to see this bill come together at long last, and look forward to it receiving President Biden's signature soon."

The Inflation Reduction Act:

• Reduces the cost of health care for millions by extending ACA subsidies for three more years,
• Allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs,
• Combats the climate crisis by reducing carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030,
• Lowers energy costs and advances energy security,
• Limits out-of-pocket expenses to $2,000 per year for seniors on Medicare.

The Inflation Reduction Act reduces the deficit and helps fight inflation by allocating a historic $300 billion for deficit reduction. It is fully paid for by:

• Implementing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax; and
• Strengthening IRS enforcement.==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Lee Issue Statement on House Vote to Reduce Defense Budget
Date: July 14, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.– U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Barbara Lee (CA-13), co-founders and Co-Chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus and members of the House Appropriations Committee, released the following statement on the House vote on their amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would cut the Pentagon's budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 by $100 billion. Reps. Pocan and Lee also proposed a $37 billion dollar cut to bring the FY23 NDAA topline back to the President's request of $813.3 billion.

Since the beginning of the Trump administration, defense spending has increased every year — over $100 billion total, an almost 20% increase. Military spending now represents more than half of all federal discretionary spending. A 2021 CBO study found that Pentagon could cut $100b per year without compromising our national defense priorities."An $839 billion defense budget is too much with too little accountability,"Rep. Pocan said."Cutting just a fraction of the Pentagon's budget could help address domestic priorities like housing, education, clean energy, and more. I'll continue fighting alongside Rep. Lee until our budgets are an accurate reflection of our priorities. Until then, I can't support this unaccountable increase to the Defense budget.""Congress should not increase the Pentagon's budget beyond what the administration has requested, and we certainly should not be adding more funding to an unauditable and unaccountable Pentagon,"said Congresswoman Lee. "The House again stands poised to pour over $800 billion dollars into a defense establishment that does little to answer the biggest threats to the safety and welfare of our people. Imagine what we could do with even a fraction of that? We could hire more than 300,000 nurses to address the nation's nursing shortage, provide free, quality child care for more than 800,000 children to help caretakers get back to work, or fully fund Build Back Better's provisions for child and earned income tax credits, improved health care access, and Medicare hearing benefits for seniors."The $100 billion dollars Rep. Pocan and I proposed to cut from the Defense budget is sorely needed for other key national priorities. We face an array of threats in America today, including the continuing COVID health emergency and the impacts of the climate crisis. It is our duty to look for savings at the Pentagon and meet the urgent needs of the American people. Enough is enough."

The proposed $100B dollar cut (Roll Call 316) failed on a vote of 350 to 78, with 1 Republican voting for passage.

The proposed $37B dollar cut (Roll Call 317) failed on a vote of 277 to 151, with 14 Republicans voting for passage.###==

Jackson Women's Health Organization,overturning 50 years of precedent affirming the constitutional right to an abortion:"This decision is awful. Throwing out nearly 50 years of settled law to eliminate fundamental human rights is outrageous and an insult to our democracy, where a significant majority of Americans wantedRoeto stand. I share the sadness, fear, and anger of that majority today."This ruling takes Wisconsin back to 1849, criminalizing abortion with no exception for rape or incest. Earlier this week, Governor Evers called the legislature back for a special session to repeal this antiquated and cruel law, but right-wing extremist Republicans gaveled in and out immediately without rectifying this terrible wrong. The deeply personal decision to terminate a pregnancy should be made by individuals and their doctors, not politicians."Though this extreme ruling is rooted in misogyny and disproportionately impacts women, it also undermines every American's right to bodily autonomy and threatens other essential protections for privacy and self-determination. Justice Thomas's concurring opinion calls on the Court to revisit prior rulings on marriage equality, contraception, and private relationships between consenting adults."The fight for basic human rights like abortion doesn't end here. The Senate must codify Roe today and not a day later."==

WASHINGTON, DC –Today,U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)introduced theNational Scenic Trails Parity Act,bipartisan legislation that will increase funding access and improve maintenance for three National Scenic Trails, including two in Wisconsin. The three trails, which are already part of the National Park System but currently lack full unit status, are the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, the North Country National Scenic Trail, and the New England National Scenic Trail."Every year, thousands of volunteers – including many of my constituents – contribute hours and hours of their time to ensure their neighbors and visitors can enjoy these beautiful trails,"Congressman Mark Pocan said."These trails are invaluable natural resources that provide communities like mine with unique outdoor experiences and economic opportunities. These trails have been particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic when outdoor recreation became essential for physical and mental well-being. This bill will level the playing field for some of the nation's most beautiful trails.""As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I am proud to be from a state with such a beautiful natural environment,"said Congressman Grothman (WI-06)."I am happy to support this bipartisan effort to ensure the Ice Age Trail has the opportunity to participate as a unit of the National Park System.""Despite being visited by millions of people, despite having more volunteer service hours than Yellowstone National Park, despite bringing people face-to-face with internationally significant geologic features, the Ice Age National Scenic Trail remains under-represented in the National Park System,"Mike Wollmer, Executive Director/CEO, Ice Age Trail Alliance said. "As a result, the Ice Age Trail faces considerable obstacles for funding and other programming. The National Scenic Trails Parity Act will bring the Ice Age Trail, as well as the North Country Trail and New England Trail, the recognition and status they deserve. We thank Rep. Pocan and other sponsors of the Act for their support to ensure the Trails' equal involvement in the National Park System.""American Hiking applauds Rep. Pocan's introduction of the bipartisan National Scenic Trails Parity Act to provide equitable access to federal resources for all National Park Service managed national scenic trails."said Kate Van Waes, Executive Director, American Hiking Society."As the 57 million strong hiking community enjoy the benefits of these world renowned congressionally designated trails, it's critical that the North Country, Ice Age, and New England National Scenic Trails have access to the same funding and management opportunities as other NPS managed national scenic trails.""The New England National Scenic Trail provides accessible outdoor recreation opportunities to millions of New England residents living in urban and rural communities,"said Susan Arnold, Interim President and CEO of the Appalachian Mountain Club."The National Scenic Trails Parity Act would provide access to vital federal funding and support to ensure continued public access and stewardship of this essential resource. AMC is grateful to Representative Pocan, Senator Baldwin, and to all original cosponsors of this bill in the House and Senate, for their work advancing this important legislation.""Each park service-administered National Scenic Trail is a national park, and they all deserve that treatment,"said Brendan Mysliwiec, Appalachian Trail Conservancy Director of Federal Policy."The Appalachian Trail Conservancy supports the recognition of national park ‘unit' status that Representative Pocan's Parity Act would provide for all National Scenic Trails, and we are committed to working with Representative Pocan to ensure the best administration of our National Scenic Trails.""The Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC) celebrates the opportunity for the North Country National Scenic Trail, Ice Age National Scenic Trail, and New England National Scenic Trail to be formally recognized as units of the National Park System,"Teresa Martinez, Continental Divide Trail Coalition Executive Director said."These trails, along with all National Scenic Trails, provide fantastic opportunities for both local communities and visitors from around the globe to enjoy the beauty and restorative powers of the outdoors.""Just as ‘all men are created equal' I believe it was the intent of the National Trails Act that all of our trails were also meant to be ‘created equal,'"Ellen von Karajan, Executive Director of the National Washington Rochambeau Revolutionary Route Association said."Our sister trails who do not have parity are hampered in their effectiveness, are not eligible to compete for certain funds for important projects they are well qualified to undertake and are denied important benefits allowed to other trails. Granting parity - leveling the playing field for all trails -isn't just ‘equitable', it's an investment that will produce real and lasting results.""The National Scenic Trails Parity Act is simple and common sense legislation that corrects an inequity in the management of National Scenic Trails by the National Park Service,"said Andrea Ketchmark, North Country Trail Association Executive Director."The North Country Trail Association, representing thousands of partners and volunteers along one of these forgotten trails, is so grateful for Rep. Pocan's leadership. His support will help ensure the agency does its part to see that these national treasures get managed properly and in line with the National Trails System Act."

Title: Pocan’s 21st Century President Act Passes House
Date: June 21, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan's (WI-02)bill, the21st Century President Act(H.R. 3285), passed the House unanimously by voice vote.Pocan's bill would make commonsense updates to gendered language in the U.S. Code, reflecting the reality that a woman or LGBTQ+ person will someday hold the office of the presidency. Without this change, the law that makes it a crime to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President or the President's family would fail to explicitly include a future female president or president with a same-sex spouse."In the last presidential election, six women and one gay man entered the Democratic primary in the race to be president, but current federal law would have failed to fully protect them and their spouses if elected,"said Representative Pocan."We're closer than we've ever been to electing a woman, or someone with a spouse of the same sex, as president. Let's not wait until that day comes to ensure the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law is guaranteed.""Words have meaning, and in 2022, our laws should reflect that a President and their spouse can be any gender,"said Congressman David N. Cicilline (RI-01), Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus."I was proud to vote today for the 21stCentury President Act, which -- by replacing certain gender-specific references in the U.S. code -- makes it clear that LGBTQ+ people and women can be President. Thank you Equality Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Mark Pocan for introducing this important bill, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler for helping shepherd this bill through the House Judiciary Committee and through the House.""I am thrilled that the House voted today to pass the 21st Century President Act,"said Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee."This bill takes direct action to modernize the language we use criminalizing threats against former Presidents and their families by removing gendered terms. As it stands, the statute defines immediate family with terms such as ‘wife,' ‘her,' and ‘widow,' which presumes the President will always be a man married to a woman. When first enacted, Congress did not account for issues of gender equality, an area in which we have made significant, though incomplete, progress. I am proud to have helped pass this bill out of the Judiciary Committee, and I am grateful to Congressman Pocan for his tireless leadership on this issue."

18 U.S.C. 879 makes it a criminal act to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President, a former President, a candidate for President, or a member of their family, while referring to Presidents as men and to their spouses as wives. ​​The bipartisan 21st Century President Act would replace the terms "wife" and "widow" with "spouse," and replaces gender-specific pronouns referring to the President and presidential spouses with gender-neutral terms to extend full protection to anyone elected to become the president and first family.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today,Defense Spending Reduction Caucus Co-Chairs Reps. Mark Pocan and Barbara Leeintroducedlegislationto cut $100 billion from the Defense budget and reallocate the funds to prioritize people over the Pentagon."The Pentagon's budget continues to grow year after year, even as our forever wars have finally wound down,"Rep. Pocan said."The United States spends more on defense than the next nine countries combined and cutting it by $100 billion will still keep the United States safe at the top spot. The amount of money the defense industry convinces Congress to spend each year doesn't protect us from real threats like climate change, pandemics, or cyber-attacks. It only lines contractors' pockets. Just imagine for once if we led the world in funding peace and not wars.""For far too long, this country has put profits ahead of its people. Nowhere is that more apparent than in our Pentagon topline budget,"said Congresswoman Lee."Just last year, key priorities like Build Back Better were left on the negotiating table, while Congress approved a $782 billion defense budget—higher than the military even requested. Meanwhile, our constituents continue to struggle with the cost of living and barriers to basic needs like housing and health care. It is time that we realign our priorities to reflect the urgent needs of communities across this country that are healing from a pandemic, ongoing economic insecurity, and an international energy crisis—none of which will be resolved through greater military spending. Taking this step to downsize our military budget by $100 billion will ensure that our national security truly centers on the American people, not weapons industry profits.""The Lee-Pocan bill disproves the claim that there's not money to feed the hungry, care for the sick, cut child poverty or protect the planet,"said Robert Weissman, President of Public Citizen."With U.S. military spending totaling more than China and the next 8 biggest military spenders combined, the Lee-Pocan bill will reclaim $100 billion in Pentagon spending and free it to be reallocated to domestic and human needs priorities. Thank you, Reps. Lee and Pocan. This is how we advance our true national security interests."

Title: Labor Caucus Celebrates JEC Report on Unions
Date: June 13, 2022
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Labor Caucus Co-Chairs Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Steven Horsford (D-NV), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Mark Pocan (D-WI) Linda Sánchez (D-CA), and Tom Suozzi (D-NY) applaud the publishing of the joint report from the House Education and Labor Committee and the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) titled"Unions Provide Major Economic Benefits for Workers and Families.""Labor unions are having more than a moment," the Co-Chairs of the Labor Caucus said. "Unions have helped level the playing field in the United States for years and this report from the Joint Economic Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee proves what we already knew: unions are not just good for workers, they're good for the entire economy. The statistics speak for themselves, creating yet another compelling reason for the Senate to immediately pass the PRO Act and protect the right to organize. Thank you to JEC Chairman Beyer and Education and Labor Chairman Scott for putting this excellent report together.""Unions are the foundation of America's middle class. For too long, the wealthy have captured an increasing share of the economic pie," JEC Chairman Beyer said. "As this report makes clear, unions help address economic inequality and ensure workers actually see the benefits when the economy grows. Even better, the positive effects of unions extend beyond just those workplaces that have formally organized. By boosting wages industry-wide, narrowing the gender and racial wage gaps and improving job quality, unions generate benefits that are economy wide. Supporting the right to organize puts more money directly into workers' pockets. That is why I continue to firmly support legislation to strengthen labor protections, including the PRO Act, which passed the House last year and would further strengthen the right of workers to join a union.""This report offers the latest evidence that labor unions are workers' best tool to access higher wages, better benefits, and safer workplaces," Education and Labor Chairman Scott said. "In fact, the benefits of union membership extend even to nonunion members and the children of unionized workers. The need to protect workers' right to organize is greater than ever. While wealthy individuals and the largest corporations continue to boost their profits, workers across the country have been forced to work in unsafe conditions for insufficient pay, because they lacked the ability to stand together and negotiate with their employer. As Chair of the Education and Labor Committee, I am committed to addressing the decades of anti-worker attacks that have eroded workers' collective bargaining rights. With the release of this report, I once again call on the Senate to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would take historic steps to strengthen workers' right to organize, rebuild our middle class, and improve the lives of workers and their families."==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and John Garamendi (CA-03) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin requesting him to scrutinize mergers in the defense industry. This comes after a Department of Defensereportin February 2022 that identifies consolidation in the defense industry as a threat that can "reduce the availability of key supplies and equipment, diminish vendors' incentives for innovation and performance in government contracts, and lead to supply chain vulnerabilities.""We write to express concern with defense industry consolidation and urge the Department to assist the Federal Trade Commission in assessing past merger impacts on defense programs; namely […] the 2018 Northrop Grumman - Orbital ATK merger," the lawmakers wrote. "In January 2022, the Federal Trade Commission blocked the proposed merger of Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne over concerns that Lockheed would use its control of Aerojet to increase prices, and the increased industry consolidation would result in lower quality goods and services to the Department of Defense."

The lawmakers continued, "We remain concerned that the 2018 merger between Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK poses the same threats […] Post-merger, Northrop enjoys virtually unilateral power to set prices on some of the most expensive military weapons on the planet, nuclear weapons […] It is critical that this merger, and all defense industry mergers, are subject to adequate scrutiny, both to keep defense contractor profiteering at bay and to advance national security priorities."

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) voted to pass the Protecting Our Children Act (H.R. 7910), a package of gun safety measures to help stem the tide of gun violence which has afflicted the United States for decades."Gun violence is a uniquely American problem," Pocan said. "There are widely popular steps we can take – steps most other countries have taken – to help stop these horrific tragedies. 321 people are shot every day in the United States, and 111 are killed. Moments of silence mean nothing without moments of action. Thoughts and prayers mean nothing if we don't take steps to prevent future tragedies. Our children are watching. Will my colleagues in the Senate stand by while kids live in fear, or will they have the strength to finally act?"

The Protecting Our Children Act includes the following titles that take steps to reduce gun violence in this country and keep people safe:

• Raising the purchasing age for semi-automatic weapons from 18 to 21 years old (Title 1)
• Cracking down on gun trafficking and straw purchases to get illegal guns off of our streets (Title 2)
• Subjecting ghost gun purchases to background check requirements (Title 3)
• Strengthening safe storage requirements to protect children from accidental shootings (Title 4)
• Closing the bump stock loophole to ban these deadly tools from civilian use (Title 5)
• Outlawing high-capacity magazines, which are designed for killing en masse and have been the accessory of choice in the bloodiest mass shootings (Title 6)

Jackson Women's Health Organization was leaked:"If this draft is any indication of how the Supreme Court will formally rule on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court will have lost the faith of all Americans. To rule against nearly 50 years of settled law to take rights away is despicable."Safe abortions will always be accessible to the wealthy. This ruling would take away bodily autonomy from so many, particularly affecting minority and low-income communities."To be clear: abortion is still the law of the land and will remain available as a healthcare choice until any rulings are officially announced. The fight for reproductive rights doesn't end here. The Senate must codify Roe today and not a day later."

Title: Pocan, Omar Urge Administration to Expedite Resettlement Applications of Refugees

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), and 24 of their colleagues sent a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ur M. Jaddou. The letter urges them to expedite the resettlement applications of refugees who were in the final stages of processing when the refugee-specific Muslim Ban was issued in October 2017.

More than 300 refugees were in the final stages of being admitted to the U.S. when former President Trump issued the Muslim Ban, including some who were just one flight away to resettle in Rep. Pocan's district with family."We write to express our concern that refugees who were in the final stages of resettlement when the Muslim Ban was issued continue to be banned from the United States. Media reports highlight the challenges these refugees face, whether in the form of unexplained denials or undue delays, when attempting to enter the country. While President Biden revoked the ban on January 20, 2021, for hundreds of refugees the "Muslim Ban" has not ended. We urge you to remedy this situation immediately."We applaud President Biden's commitment to ending the Muslim Ban and to welcoming more refugees into the country. We urge your agencies to act on this commitment by fully implementing the settlement in JFS of Seattle v. Trump as quickly as possible and by expediting the resettlement applications of those who were in the final stages of entering the U.S. when the refugee-specific Muslim Ban was announced,"the letter continues."[Government data released as part of a settlement] suggests that these denials are a result of the Muslim Ban or agency actions taken in furtherance of the Ban, and we call on your administration to fulfill the commitment it made to review and remedy such discriminatory impact.""We must ensure that the Muslim Ban and the hate it signified are truly a thing of the past."

The letter was also signed by Representatives Donald S. Beyer Jr., Jamaal Bowman, Yvette D. Clarke, Mark DeSaulnier, Debbie Dingell, Adriano Espaillat, Dwight Evans, Jesús G. "Chuy" García, Raúl M. Grijalva, Henry C. "Hank" Johnson, Jr., Barbara Lee, Andy Levin, Alan Lowenthal, James P.

WASHINGTON, DC –Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, released the following statement on President Biden's fiscal year 2023 budget request:"Just two weeks ago, Congress enacted the fiscal year 2022 spending package that overwhelmingly put working families first. This morning's budget request continues that trend with a 9.5% increase in non-defense spending, including a boost in funding for health, manufacturing, and environmental programs. I thank the president for this budget, which invests in our future, lowers costs on everyday families, and increases workers' paychecks. His budget also takes steps to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes which will, in turn, reduce the national deficit."However, now more than ever, I am convinced that we spend too much on defense contractors and not enough onnational defense. Pandemics, climate change, and cyber-attacks are real threats to our national security, yet little of the Pentagon's budget goes to these important items. Instead, we still operate on an old-fashioned model of enriching defense contractors in the guise of protecting jobs. We need a modern paradigm that protects Americans from real threats, not just the bottom lines of unaccountable defense contractors."I look forward to beginning the appropriations process and working with President Biden to uphold these vital programs while reducing our bloated defense budget."==

WASHINGTON, D.C.— Representatives Barbara Lee and Mark Pocan, Co-Chairs and Founders of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus, sent a letter to President Biden urging him to resist pressures to increase defense spending in his Fiscal Year 2023 budget request."We support your strategic response to Russia so far, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the pursuit of peace in the region. As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 budget request, we know some Members of Congress will seek an increase in defense spending. Respectfully, we ask that you do everything in your power to resist such increases,"the lawmakers wrote."You resisted calls for historic increases…in your first budget, and you requested $753 billion in defense spending. The U.S. House of Representatives more than doubled your desired increase and included $768.2 billion in the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act. Ultimately, in the omnibus appropriation legislation signed into law earlier this week, the new enacted defense spending level is $782 billion…"they continued."Some of our colleagues will continue to seek virtually unlimited amounts of funding for the Department of Defense, no matter the Department's own assessments of its needs for the coming fiscal year. This mission creep is dangerous to peace-seeking efforts, and it will continue to starve our domestic priorities of needed funding."

MADISON, WI – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee,celebrates the final passage of the fiscal year 2022 omnibus appropriation legislation. This $1.5 trillion piece of legislation will fund the federal government through the remainder of the fiscal year and is expected to be signed by President Biden later today."It's a momentous day for Wisconsin. This government funding bill sends tens of millions of dollars in projects to Wisconsin's 2nd District. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I'm proud to have fought to ensure these projects were included in the bill, and I look forward to seeing the impact they have on our community,"Rep. Pocan said.

The omnibus contains numerous provisions that will benefit Wisconsin's 2nd Congressional District directly, including (but not limited to):

• $39.7 millionfor constructing a newPlant Breeding Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The existing World War II-era building, which is shared by U.S. Dept. of Agriculture researchers, is outdated and in severe need of replacement.
• $2 millionfor aMen's Homeless Shelter in Madison.
• $1 milliontoward theconstruction of the Center for Black Excellence & Culture in Madison.
• $500,000for a newBoys & Girls Club in Beloit.

• $5 millionfortraumatic brain injury research at UW-Madison.
• $26 millionfor the U.S. Geological Survey's Cooperative Research Units which includes theWisconsin Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit at UW-Madison.

Congressman Pocan also fought to remove a funding offset originally included in the bill that would have eliminated $225 million in state and local government funds previously promised to Wisconsin in the American Rescue Plan passed last year. A report on Wisconsin's plans for its total allotment of funding is availablehere, Dane County's initial report to the U.S. Treasury Department is availablehere, and the City of Madison's report is availablehere.

Rep. Pocan continued,"I'll always put Wisconsin first, which is why I helped lead the effort with Governor Evers and Senator Baldwin to protect $225 million allocated for our state through the American Rescue Plan. A small provision in this bill would have stripped this vital funding away for 30 states had my colleagues and I not intervened. Fortunately, Wisconsin's promised funds have been preserved."

This legislation contained numerous historic increases in federal funding, including:

• $550 millionforRural Broadband Expansion(on top of $2 billion provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act)
• $26.9 billionforChild Nutrition Programs($1.77 billion increase)

WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee,voted to pass a $1.5 trillion package to fund the United States government and provide aid to Ukraine as part of the FY2022 Omnibus Appropriations agreement."This historic government funding package is huge for Wisconsin and the rest of the country.

This bill also makes sure all of the funds promised to Wisconsin through the American Rescue Plan, more than $1 billion outstanding, are delivered to the state."

The bill also provides critical humanitarian relief to Ukraine." Since Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked war, millions of Ukrainian civilians have suffered unnecessarily, creating a humanitarian crisis not seen in Europe since World War II.

WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)issued the following statement in response to a report released by former Justice Michael Gableman questioning the legitimacy of the free and fair 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin:"Justice Gableman's pointless investigation was an amateur clown show from the beginning. Not only was this incompetence a national embarrassment, but an enormous waste of tax dollars, yielding nothing but a set of recommendations that attack our democracy. It's time for the GOP to end this charade, start working for the American people, and accept that Joe Biden won the election nearly 16 months ago."==

Despite this coordinated corporate anti-union campaign, the Starbucks workersformed a union."On Tuesday, it wasreportedthat Starbucks fired nearly the entire union organizing committee at a store in Memphis, Tennessee. The rationale offered by Starbucks is that these employees violated company policy, but a former manager at the Memphis store has goneon the recordto refute this."This type of reported behavior underscores the need for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which passed the House over one year ago withsupport from the Labor Caucus. The PRO Act will offer workers protections and guarantee their right to organize without interference or fear of reprisal by their employers."We have had it with corporate spokespeople and lobbyists saying they're pro-worker when asking for meetings on Capitol Hill, while at the same time using every trick in the book to stop unionizing efforts cold in their tracks. Workers have the right to organize – it's time they had a level playing field to do so.We once again call on theSenate to pass the PRO Actand send it to President Biden's desk to be signed into law."==

This transformational bill will help families across the country. Tens of millions of American families will get a tax break. It lowers the cost of childcare for parents and prescription drugs for seniors. It creates millions of jobs, many of which tackle climate change. And it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have not paid their fair share of taxes.

"I'm confident we will pass both the Build Back Better Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure agreement because this is something that's a priority for Democrats from Joe Biden down to every member of the House and Senate. We support the values that are in the Build Back Better Act and the infrastructure bill, and you have several hundred people right now all rowing together, including Democrats in the House and Senate, to get this done. There's a couple handfuls that are still picking what kind of wood they want their oar to be made out of, but we'll get there. I am as confident as Speaker Pelosi that we're going to get both of these big bills done, and really provide some help to American families.""These are twin bills that are going to move together. The process isn't important, and everyone right now is focusing on the process. It's the product, and at the end of the day, this is going to be a tax cut for 40 million American families who have children via the tax credit, it's going to reduce the costs for American families through paying less for prescription drugs and child care and family leave, and a whole lot of other areas to create millions of jobs, many of which have a green focus, a climate change focus, and it's paid for. This is a popular agenda, and the real opponents of this bill is Big Pharma and the special interests who don't want to pay for this. We will get this done because Democratic values are exactly what's in this bill.""These values are Democratic values. We know our constituents want these things, including affordable child care, family leave policies, and expanding health care options. There's so much in here that's good for American families and they are Democratic values. Even the people who are a little slow to come to the party, there's several hundreds of us who are there. As Nancy Pelosi said, this is not an inner party fight. The opposition out there is Big Pharma and the special interests, many of which are running commercials, trying to pressure members of Congress. I think we're bigger than this, and Joe Biden has done a great job in rallying us as well, and this will happen. It may not be Monday, it may be Wednesday, maybe the following Wednesday. At the end of the day, what matters is the product, and we will deliver."==
Title: Pocan Statement on Voting Against the NDAA

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after he voted against the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill he has been opposed to since being sworn into Congress in 2013."This is proof that the military-industrial complex is alive and well. We have serious threats facing our nation, like COVID-19 and climate change. Even just a small cut to the Pentagon's bloated budget could help fight these very serious threats. The fact that the Pentagon budget continues to grow year after year is an embarrassment. In fact, we spend more on our defense budget than the next 11-highest spending countries combined. I won't stop fighting to limit the Pentagon spending that's being used to fund the slush funds of defense contractors."

Rep. Pocan also championed two defense spending reduction amendments to this year's NDAA. One, offered with Rep. Barbara Lee (CA-13) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), sought to reduce overall defense spending by 10%, and the other, also offered with Rep. Barbara Lee, sought to cut spending back to the level requested by President Biden – approximately a $25 billion reduction. 86 Democrats voted for the first amendment and 142 Democrats voted for the second.==

Title: Pocan, Murray, Baldwin Reintroduce Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to Address Campus Bullying and Harassment
Date: September 22, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)andU.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)re-introduced theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2021,legislation to address bullying and harassment, including cyberbullying, at colleges and universities around the country. The lawmakers introduced the bill on the anniversary of the death of Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who tragically lost his life to suicide in 2010 after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him due to his sexual orientation.

The bill would require colleges and universities to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion, and require schools to recognize "cyberbullying" as a form of harassment."Today we honor the life of Tyler Clementi by reintroducing this critical legislation. No one should be bullied because of who they are or who they love,"Rep. Pocan said."This bill will help ensure that students can learn in peace and not have to worry about living in fear or humiliation for being themselves.""Every student deserves to feel safe, full stop. But for too many students, campus bullying and harassment just devastates their mental, emotional, and physical health—in particular LGBTQIA+ students, who are nearly twice as likely to face this type of abuse. And this is all in the middle of a pandemic that has made mental health issues even worse,"said Senator Patty Murray."Our legislation would require colleges to establish strong policies that ensure everyone—no matter who they are or who they love—can pursue higher education free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. I'm proud to join my colleagues in honoring Tyler Clementi's life by working to make sure what happened to Tyler, never happens to another student.""No student should live in fear of being who they are at school,"said Senator Baldwin."By reintroducing this legislation, we are taking a strong step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to learn and succeed in safe and healthy environments. Everyone at our colleges and universities deserves to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying."

Today, bullying and harassment are still widespread in higher education—and LGBTQIA+ students arenearly twice as likelyto experience it as their non-LGBTQIA+ peers. The consequences can be severe for students' mental health, and the pandemic compounded existing mental health challenges. In fact, throughout the pandemic,65% of LGBTQIA+ college studentsfaced moderate or severe mental health challenges—and 22% felt that they had no social or emotional support system.

TheTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2021would help address campus bullying and harassment and keep students safe by:

• requiring all colleges and universities receiving federal aid to prohibit the harassment of enrolled students based on their actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion;
• requiring school to recognize "cyberbullying" as a form of harassment; and
• creating a grant program to help colleges and universities start or expand programs to prevent harassment and provide counseling services to students who have experienced harassment."We are grateful to Congressman Pocan and Senators Murray and Baldwin for reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, and fully supporting this legislation. We believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. Because every student deserves a positive educational experience in a safe environment free of harassment, bullying or humiliation, where they can learn, study and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school's care,"said Jane Clementi, CEO and Co-Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation and Tyler's mother."The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is an important step toward making America's colleges and universities safer and more affirming for LGBTQ+ students by requiring the establishment of policies that prohibit harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity,"said JoDee Winterhof, Human Rights Campaign Senior Vice President, Policy & Political Affairs."Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan's steadfast leadership championing this crucial bill will not only save lives, the legislation will support institutions in fostering inclusive and supportive learning environments that allow all students to thrive.""All students deserve to learn with safety, dignity, and respect. This bill ensures schools treat harassment against all students seriously, including online harassment, which has unfortunately increased during the pandemic. No student should have to endure what Tyler Clementi experienced, and we are proud to support this important bill,"said Emily Martin, Vice President for Education & Workplace Justice at the National Women's Law Center.

The legislation has been endorsed by: the Tyler Clementi Foundation, Human Rights Campaign (HRC), National Women's Law Center (NWLC), American Association of University Women (AAUW), American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA), and the Trevor Project.

"Fort McCoy is a really well-run operation. By the weekend, they're going to have some people going into communities throughout the country. This is our obligation, and it's also our opportunity to thank the people who protected our soldiers who were in Afghanistanfor20 years. They and their families now are out of harm's way with the Taliban, and we're going to make sure that they're a part of this country.""These refugees have been really great atFort McCoy. There's been nothing but great stories. They're getting vaccinated. In fact, the capacity is 13,000 people, and one person has turned down the COVID vaccine. Wouldn't you like to see that in the United States population? They're ready to be a part of this country. They served and protected our soldiersfor many, many years. Any kind of rhetoric about whatever background they may have, we have to remember, if we want to ever be able to work with another country, in a future situation, we're going to have to deliver. And I think right now, this country is certainly lifting both its hands and hearts to those people.""It's going near perfect in the transition, and now they're finding 50,000 places across the country to host folks. This is really important that we get it done right, and we're on the right track. I give President Biden a lot of credit because he made a very tough but important decision to leave Afghanistan, and at the end of the day, people agree with that decision.""Joe Biden got things done by August 31st as he said, and we've got ourselves out of this situation. I just hope that the next time someone decides they're going to go into a country that's very different than the United States, that they don't do what Dick Cheney and George Bush did, which is think that we're going to leave with a bunch of Dunkin Donuts and Disneylands. That was never going to happen, and it's the right thing to get out of there, but let's make sure we pause next time someone looks at nation-building in a country like this."###==

The United States has real threats here at home – we should be reducing defense spending and redirecting and reinvesting it to fight COVID-19, climate change, and help strengthen our cyber security systems. This bloated budget is already significantly more than what the President requested, and I will not standfor it.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)andBarbara Lee (CA-13), both co-founders and Co-Chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus and members of the House Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith today urging him and the committee to not pass a National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA) that is larger than the level requested by President Biden earlier this year."At a time when the United States is withdrawing from wars abroad, we should be committed to cutting our defense spending now more than ever,"Congressman Pocan said."The FY22 NDAA should absolutely be lower than current spending levels, and in no way should it be even a penny more than what the Commander-in-Chief requested or what the House Appropriations committee approved. The threats of today are different than those of years past and cannot be solved by military might alone. COVID-19 remains the greatest threat to our country and the world, yet only a small percentage is vaccinated against this deadly disease. Climate change is destroying neighborhoods in the blink of an eye. We should be fighting these very real threats instead of authorizing more than what was requested to fund the slush funds of defense contractors.""As we watch the tragic humanitarian situation unfold in Afghanistan, we must reevaluate our priorities when it comes to cutting the bloated defense budget that has enabled 40 years of blank check wars around the globe,"said Congresswoman Barbara Lee."Despite trillions of dollars poured into our endless military spending, this budget has failed to meet the greatest threats that our nation and our world faces today, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and the needs of 140 million people living in poverty. Now is the time to shift our investments away from endless wars and toward addressing human needs."

The Honorable Adam Smith

Chairman

House Armed Services Committee

2216 Rayburn House Office Building

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Smith:

We request that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA) reported by the House Armed Services Committee not exceed an authorization level larger than the level requested in President Biden's budget submission to Congress or the amount of appropriations already approved by the House Appropriations Committee.

We are aware that the Senate Armed Services Committee recently passed an FY22 NDAA that is $25 billion larger than what the Commander-in-Chief requested. This number is above and beyond the more than one percent increase in funding requested by President Biden and approved by the House Appropriations Committee. Surpassing the President's request by such a large and unwarranted amount should not be the starting position of the House Armed Services Committee, particularly when current defense spending levels should already be reduced.

America spends more on its military than the next 11 largest defense-spending nations combined. This will remain true if the President's budget request were enacted, and the ratio will only increase under the Senate's proposal. At a time when America's largest national security threat is a global pandemic, our spending priorities should embrace efforts such as increased COVID vaccination efforts abroad instead of continually increased military spending – especially during a period of military withdrawal from foreign wars.

Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward to working with you to produce an FY22 NDAA that is no larger than President Biden's budget request and that is aligned with the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan

WASHINGTON, D.C. –U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) issuedthe following statement after House passage of the $3.5 trillion budget resolution that will shape the United States economy for years to come:"Today is a great day. Historians will look at today's vote as a pivotal point in American history. One that forever changed the trajectory American values. Today we put workers, families, and our nation's future first. While this is just the first step in strengthening the social safety net, it shows that elections matter. This will be a long process, but one that I am hopeful that will result in expanding the child tax break for years to come, free Pre-K to 3- and 4-year-olds, free community college, paid family leave for all, a reinvestment in the care economy, a commitment towards fighting climate change, and citizenship for dreamers. This investment in America will make our country safer, healthier, greener, and better for all."

Title: Pocan Introduces The “COVID Defense Act” to Direct Just Over 1 Percent of Pentagon Spending Towards Vaccinating 30% of the World’s Poorest Populations
Date: August 18, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)introduced the COVID Defense Act, which would transfer a 1.3% of U.S. military spending, $9.6 billion, to global vaccination efforts, vaccinating potentially an additional 30% of the world's low-income population within a year."We can't bomb our way out of a global pandemic,"Congressman Pocan said."Right now, COVID is the greatest risk to our national security as well as the world's security. Shifting funds from weaponry and military contractors to producing COVID vaccines will save hundreds of thousands – if not millions – of lives around the world. At a time when America spends more on its military than the next 11 closest nations combined, we should be able to sacrifice a little over 1% of that to save lives, build global goodwill, and actually make the world a safer, healthier place."

The $9.6 billion in additional COVAX funding for vaccine procurement could lead to an additional 1.8 billion COVID vaccine doses for lower-income countries in 2021 and early 2022, combinedto protect potentially 60% of the populationin low-income countries as part of the 91 nations participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment program. By more than doubling the amount of funds available for vaccine production, procurement, and distribution internationally, the COVID Defense Act could enable up to another 30% of the world's vulnerable population to have access to a COVID vaccine – greatly curtailing the ongoing spread of COVID-19 variants."I can think of no effort that would do more to positively position the United States around the world as a caring nation, while directly showing our global position, than distributing vaccines. The United States is the greatest democracy in the world, and we best show that by sharing our wealth and knowledge,"said Pocan.

The COVID Defense Act would remove $9.6 billion in defense spending – 1.3% of the $740.5 billion authorized in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act – and authorize President Biden to direct the same amount of funding to COVID vaccine production and distribution efforts benefitting the low-income international community. The bill protects funds intended for our U.S. military personnel from any possible transfer.###==

Title: Pocan Calls on OpenGate Capital to Abandon Plan to Extract Jobs from Hufcor Factory, Reaffirms Need to Hold Predatory Private Equity Firms Accountable
Date: July 28, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement expressing his concerns about OpenGate Capital's plans to outsource 150+ jobs at the Hufcormanufacturing plant in Janesville, WI to Mexico. He also reaffirmed the need for his bill, the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, which will be reintroduced in the coming months. This legislation would fundamentally reform the private equity industry by forcing private equity firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over, empowering workers, and protecting investors."The fallout from OpenGate Capital's decision to extract over one-hundred and fifty good union jobs from Janesville could have devastating consequences on Hufcor workers and their families, and I am calling on OpenGate to abandon their plan immediately. This isn't the first time we've seen private equity firms swoop into a community, squeeze a business for cash, and leave workers with absolutely nothing. It's time that we finally hold these predatory private equity firms accountable for the damage they've done in communities across the country.

I look forward to reintroducing my bicameral legislation with Senator Warren, the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, which would ensure private equity takes responsibility for the outcomes of businesses they take over and would end their practice of looting portfolio companies. This legislation would also put a stop to extractive practices that incentivize buying companies to sell them for parts, and most importantly, protect workers like those at Hufcor, many of whom I represent in Congress, from the consequences of firms' greed."###==
Title: Pocan Votes to Curb Dangerous PFAS Chemicals Found in Wisconsin’s Drinking Water
Date: July 21, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, voted to protect Wisconsin families from exposure to dangerous PFAS chemicals with H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act. This legislation seeks to address "forever chemicals," which pose a direct threat to public health, and implement stronger protections against future pollution."In Madison, Wisconsin, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in every single one of our city wells. Fifty other cities across the state have also found the same chemicals in their water,"Congressman Mark Pocan said."For far too long we have allowed these toxic chemicals that have been linked to cancer, infertility, and more to pollute our air, land, and water. That's why I proudly voted for the PFAS Action Act, which will finally ban these toxic forever chemicals from our communities, introduce stricter protections against PFAS pollution, and hold polluters accountable."

PFAS chemicals represent a serious public health risk to nearly all Americans. The CDC has reported that PFAS is present in nearly every American's blood, exposing countless people to life-threatening illness and disease, including cancer, liver disease, asthma, thyroid dysfunction, infertility, and impaired child development.

A new study using EPA data shows that an estimated 30,000 industrial sites are known or suspected of using toxic PFAS: twelve times what had been previously estimated. American servicemembers and their families are also at particular risk of exposure, as more than 400 U.S. military sites are known to have PFAS contamination.

By passing the PFAS Action Act, the House makes important progress toward cleaning up our communities and holding contaminating companies accountable for their pollution. This legislation designates the two most studied PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances immediately and sets a deadline for the EPA to make designation decisions about all other PFAS chemicals – which has been a key barrier to cleaning up industrial and military sites. The bill also creates new grants and partnerships to help states with clean-up and remediation efforts. To prevent future contamination, the bill introduces stricter limits on PFAS pollution and the introduction of new PFAS chemicals, as well tougher testing, reporting and monitoring requirements.

These projects were included in the "Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation in America (INVEST in America) Act," which seeks to revitalize America's infrastructure."I am proud to have secured $18 million in critical funding to rebuild South Central Wisconsin's transportation infrastructure,"Congressman Pocan said."For too long, we have failed to act boldly when it comes to investing in our infrastructure, and this has left us with unsafe bridges, congested roads, failing sewer systems, and many other critical structural issues. The INVEST in America Act would also help create millions of good-paying jobs and support U.S. manufacturing, while setting our country on a path toward zero emissions in the transportation sector. This bill takes a step forward in getting us on the right track to create economic opportunity for all in the 21stcentury and beyond."

Congressman Pocan's surface transportation projects included in the INVEST in America Act are listed below.

Title: Pocan, Scott, Hirono, Murray Introduce Bill to Double Pell Grant, Make College More Affordable
Date: June 16, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, DC—Today, Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Robert C. "Bobby" Scott (VA-03), chair of the House Education & Labor Committee, and Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Patty Murray (D-WA),chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, reintroduced the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, legislation that would double the Pell Grant award, index the award to inflation, and make other changes to expand the awardfor working students and families. The bill also makes the Pell Grant funding fully mandatory to protect it from funding shortfalls, expands the program to includeDREAMers, and restores lifetime eligibilityfor the program to 18 semesters, among other changes that will benefit students."No one should be denied a chance at a higher education if they are smart enough and capable enough, but are unable to afford it. As a recipient of the Pell Grant myself, I know just how instrumental of a tool it is to make college accessibleforall,"Congressman Pocan said."Unfortunately, rising tuition costs and perpetual underfunding continues to undermine this critical program. The Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act would not only double the maximum Pell Grant, it would protect the program from future cuts, expand eligibility to includeDREAMers, and ensure that postsecondary education is attainablefor every student—regardless of their socioeconomic status.""The Pell Grant is the most important tool we have to help students afford college. Unfortunately, due to the rising cost of college, the purchasing power of Pell Grants has severely eroded over time,"Chairman Scott of the House Committee on Education and Labor said."By doubling the maximum Pell award, and adjusting future awardsfor inflation, the Pell Grant Preservation & Expansion Act will go a long way to restore the purchasing power and help millions of students earn a quality degree, without beingforced to take on excessive debt.""Every year, Pell Grants make college more affordablefor millions of students in the United States—including tens of thousands of students in Hawaii. But over the last decade, the value of the Pell Grant has steadily declined—from covering nearly fourth-fifths of the cost of attendance at a public, four-year institution at its height, to less than one-third,"Senator Hirono said."With the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, we have a real opportunity to restore the value of the Pell Grantfor generations of students. I join my colleagues Senator Murray and Representatives Scott and Pocan in introducing this important legislation that will help more students pursue higher education.""It's thanks to Pell grants that I was able to graduate and get a great education from Washington State University—but today's students are being asked to pay morefor college with less financial support. Students should never beforced to give up their higher education dreams because they can't afford it—and this legislation will take a significant step in helping to make sure college is within reachfor more students,"Senator Murray said."I'm proud to introduce the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act alongside my colleagues, and I'll be working hard to get this across the finish line and ensure that every student—no matter how much money their family makes—has the opportunity to succeed."

Representative Scott andformer Representative Susan Davis (D-CA), along with Senators Hirono and Murray, introduced a similar version of this legislation during the 115thCongress. Last year, several provisions from that bill were included in the year-end spending package, which restored Pell Grant eligibilityfor incarcerated individuals, students who have been defrauded, and students with drug-related offenses; raised the "auto-zero" thresholdfor the program; and increased the income protection allowance—improving the programfor students.

In addition to Representatives Pocan and Scott, and Senators Hirono and Murray, the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act is cosponsored by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris VanHollen(D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ed Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), JeanneShaheen(D-NH), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Representatives JakeAuchincloss(D-MA), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), SuzanneBonamici(D-OR), Brendan Boyle (D-PA), Cori Bush (D-MO), Andre Carson (D-IN), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), Joe Courtney (D-CT), Val Demings (D-FL), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Mike Doyle (D-PA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), John Garamendi (D-CA), Raul M.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Labor Caucus co-chairsRepresentatives Linda T. Sánchez (D-CA), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Tom Suozzi (D-NY), andSteven Horsford (D-NV)led 36 members of Congress in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urging them to rescind former AG William Barr's petition with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to exclude immigration judges from eligibility for membership in the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ). The NAIJ has been the recognized representative of immigration judges for collective bargaining purposes since 1979, advocating on behalf of immigration judges on issues including performance evaluations and discipline, judicial security, COVID response, and efficient docket management."Immigration judges—like all public sector workers—deserve the right to be represented by a union,"said the Labor Caucus Co-Chairs. "The Trump Administration was ideologically hostile to collective bargaining, but we believe federal agencies should act in alignment with President Biden's directives in support of the right of employees to organize and join a union.

The Honorable Lisa MonacoDeputy Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, DC 20530

Dear Attorney General Garland and Deputy Attorney General Monaco:

As Members of the Labor Caucus, we write to express our deep and urgent concern regarding the Department of Justice's (DOJ) policy regarding the right of immigration judges to be represented by a union.

The Trump Administration was ideologically hostile to collective bargaining. President Trump himself issued three executive orders in 2018 that undermined public sector unions and the statutory right of federal employees to be represented by unions.[1]Under then-Attorney General Barr, DOJ also took steps to effectuate President Trump's opposition to collective bargaining by filing a petition with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to exclude immigration judges from eligibility for membership in the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ).

The NAIJ has been the recognized representative of immigration judges for collective bargaining purposes since 1979. For years NAIJ has advocated on behalf of immigration judges on many issues including performance evaluations and discipline, judicial security, COVID response, and efficient docket management. NAIJ's collective bargaining agreement has protected judges from unfair discipline. Further, NAIJ has advanced the causes of due process, transparency, accountability, efficiency, and professionalism in the Immigration Court.

DOJ's petition was denied by the FLRA's Office of General Counsel in July 2020. Attorney General Barr then filed an application for review, pursuant to which the previous denial was reversed by the two-member Republican FLRA majority just days before the election in November 2020. In his dissenting opinion, then-FLRA Member and current FLRA Chairman Ernest DuBester characterized the majority decision as "the antithesis of reasoned decision making" and stated that "it is abundantly clear that the majority's sole objective is to divest the [immigration judges] of their statutory rights." NAIJ filed a motion to reconsider this ruling which is currently pending.

Elections have consequences. One of President Biden's first actions was to rescind the Trump anti-union executive orders. Now it is up to you to rescind former Attorney General Barr's anti-union petition with the FLRA. Should the FLRA's decision be allowed to stand, the ramifications and the legal basis for the decision will have an immediate negative effect on NAIJ and all its bargaining unit members. But it will have an equally, if not far more, profound impact on federal employees' right to form and join a union. Any professional employee will be vulnerable to being characterized as a manager because the FLRA decision is so broad and provides no rationale for the departure from its prior precedent.

We believe federal agencies should move forward in alignment with President Biden's values and directives in support of the right of employees to organize and join a union. Therefore, we urge you to rescind this anti-union petition before the FLRA.

Sincerely,

Rep. Mark Pocan

Title: Labor Caucus Leads 100+ Members Urging Biden to Issue OSHA Standard for Frontline Workers

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, Labor Caucus Co-ChairsRepresentatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Linda T. Sánchez (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Steven Horsford (D-NV), and Tom Suozzi (D-NY)led over 100 members of Congress in a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to immediately issue the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect frontline workers from COVID-19. President Biden initially set a March 15 deadline for an ETS to be issued and the delay continues to put workers' safety in jeopardy."Our nation's workers need an enforceable federal standard that will ensure that their employers provide the comprehensive protections they need, including ventilation, respiratory protection, testing and screening, exposure notification, and on-site vaccinations,"said the Labor Caucus Co-Chairs. "Frontline workers are working to provide health care, groceries, meatpacking, transportation, and other essential services that keep our country running, often without enforceable health and safety standards specific to COVID-19. We urge the President to issue the OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard immediately.""Nurses and other health care and frontline workers across the nation continue to work without the critical protections we need to prevent Covid exposure, illness, and death,"said Deborah Burger, RN, president of National Nurses United (NNU)."The failure to protect workers has cost thousands of lives. For more than 15 months, NNU has been advocating for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue an emergency temporary standard to ensure that employers protect their workers during the pandemic, a standard that has yet to be issued. We are grateful to the co-chairs of the Congressional Labor Caucus and the 106 Members of Congress who signed this letter, for standing with nurses and other frontline workers and demanding the workplace health and safety protections that we need," she continued. "NNU strongly urges the Biden Administration to immediately issue an OSHA emergency temporary standard as mandated by the president's Jan. 21 executive order."

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

President of the United States

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear President Biden:

We write to congratulate you on progress your administration has made in combatting the Covid-19 virus. Your administration's efforts have saved the lives of countless Americans and have put our country on the path towards recovery. However, we urgently request that your administration immediately issue the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect frontline workers from Covid-19.

While your administration has made significant strides to protect workers and the public from the Covid-19 virus, frontline workers remain at risk as they face continuing exposure to Covid-19 in the workplace. As you know, many frontline workers are working to provide health care, groceries, meatpacking, transportation, and other essential services that keep our country running, often without enforceable health and safety standards specific to Covid-19.

On January 21st, you issued an Executive Order directing the Department of Labor to "consider whether any emergency temporary standards on Covid-19, including with respect to masks in the workplace, are necessary, and if such standards are determined to be necessary, issue them by March 15, 2021." The ETS was only formally sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on April 26th, beginning a two-week Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) review.

More than two months have passed since your original deadline for an ETS to be issued, and OMB has had a month to review the proposed ETS. The consequences of these delays are dire, and for some workers the delay has been fatal. Our nation's workers need an enforceable federal standard that will ensure that their employers provide the comprehensive protections they need, including ventilation, respiratory protection, testing and screening, exposure notification, and on-site vaccinations.

Further, on May 13th, the CDC issued new Covid guidelines which state that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, avoid crowds or large gatherings, or need to isolate after exposure or get tested unless they are symptomatic. We are concerned that these new guidelines may put frontline workers across the country at further risk of illness and death while no OSHA ETS is in place. We respectfully urge you to issue the OSHA ETS and ensure it covers all at-risk workers without further delay.

Sincerely,

Rep. Mark Pocan

Title: Education Dept. Confirms, WI GOP Throwing Away $1.5 in Federal Aid for Education

MADISON, WI—After reaching out to the Department of Education to ask whether the state GOP's insufficient education budget proposal would disqualify Wisconsin from receiving $1.5 billion in federal COVID aid,Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)received confirmation that Wisconsin would lose the federal aid if they move forward with the GOP's budget proposal. Congressman Pocan released the following statement and shared the Department of Education's letter to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and Governor Tony Evers."The GOP majority in the state legislature is playing budgetary games that will cost Wisconsin taxpayers at least $1.5 billion in federal aid for state schools. The Department of Education has confirmed that Wisconsin Republicans are on track to ensure our state loses out on billions in aid to students, schools, colleges & universities. It's time for the Republican-led legislature to stop playing games, fund education like they are supposed to, and use billions in additional federal aid to help Wisconsin get out of this COVID downturn. Anything less is insufficient."

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Barbara Lee (D-CA), co-chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus, released the following statement in response to President Biden's proposed FY2022 budget for the Department of Defense."If budgets are moral documents, a $13 billion increase in defense spending is a failure that doesn't reflect this country's actual needs. In the last year, the biggest threat to our nation was a global pandemic and we were drastically unprepared for it. Now, we're proposing a defense spending increase that alone is 1.5 times larger than the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention's entire $8.7 billion budget. We need to redefine what defense and national security means in this country. Job security, healthcare security, housing security, climate security—these are the national security crises we should be defending the American people against—not more futile wars abroad or lucrative contracts for private defense contractors."The Pentagon cannot even pass an audit, why on earth would we throw another $13 billion at an agency filled with fraud, waste, and little to no oversight. Congress must act this year to cut what we spend on war and refocus on the most pressing challenges confronting Americans and the world."==
Title: Pocan: GOP Ready to Throw Another $1.5 Billion in Federal Funding with Education Aid Away
Date: May 28, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement in response to the Wisconsin Republican Party's refusal to fund K-12 and higher education at the level necessary to qualify for $1.5 billion in federal COVID aid."Once again, Wisconsin Republicans are selfishly screwing Wisconsinites out of $1.5 Billion in federal COVID relief,"said Congressman Pocan. "For the last year, the GOP-led state legislature has barely shown up to work, yet found time to threaten billions in federal food aid, COVID relief, healthcare assistance, and now relief for our students, schools, colleges, and universities. As a member of Congress, I work hard to ensure the people of Wisconsin receive the billions in federal aid that they deserve. At a certain point, the Wisconsin GOP must recognize that they have become the party of fiscal irresponsibility in the name of partisan pageantry. Wisconsinites elected these state legislators to help them—not to repeatedly stand in the way of relief, in the middle of an economic and healthcare crisis."

In order to qualify for federal aid to Wisconsin schools—under the Consolidated Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan—states must maintain the same budget for K-12 and higher education in 2021-22 and 2022-23 as their average allocations in 2016-2019. In Wisconsin, the state legislature would need to add $387 million in funding for K-12 education and $41.2 million for higher education. However, the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee in the state legislature is falling short once again—adding only $128 million to K-12 education—risking $1.5 billion in federal COVID relief for Wisconsin. In response to possibly losing billions in education funding, the state GOP is trying to claim that a $350 billion fund that can be used for any purpose it wishes - even purposes not related to education - will "fix" the problem. Unfortunately, GOP budget tricks will not guarantee federal aid to Wisconsinites.==
Title: Pocan, Kind & Moore Request Full ARP Funds for Wisconsin

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Gwen Moore (WI-04), and Ron Kind (WI-03)sent a letter today to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen opposing the Treasury's reduced allocations for the state of Wisconsin from the American Rescue Plan's Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. When the American Rescue Plan was signed into law, the Congressional Research Service estimated Wisconsin would receive $3.2 billion—$700 million more than the Treasury's final issuance of $2.5 billion. Additionally, the lawmakers requested the Treasury provide Wisconsin with its funds in one single payment—rather than a two-part payment separated by a full year."We passed the American Rescue Plan to provide $3.2 billion in relief for Wisconsinites, and Wisconsin deserves the full sum of those funds now,"said the Representatives."We look forward to working with the Treasury Department to provide Wisconsin with the full amount of funds it was initially promised.

See the full letter below.

May 12, 2021

The Honorable Janet Yellen
Secretary of the Treasury
U.S. Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20220

Dear Secretary Yellen:

Thank you for publishing the Interim Final Rule for Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. The billions of dollars that Wisconsin will receive from these funds will be invaluable to ensuring our state successfully recovers from the economic and public health harms caused by the coronavirus pandemic. That is why we write to express our deep concern about the approximately $700 million discrepancy between the Congressional Research Service's (CRS) estimate of what Wisconsin should receive from the American Rescue Plan and what Treasury has published as Wisconsin's final allocation. Additionally, we are troubled by your decision to split Wisconsin's allocation in half and release the second tranche of funding one calendar year from now.

Section 9901 of Public Law 117-2, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, states that the amount of funding payable to each state is:"…an amount which bears the same proportion to such remainder as the average estimated number of seasonally-adjusted unemployed individuals (as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] Local Area Unemployment Statistics program) in the State or District of Columbia over the 3-month period ending with December 2020 bears to the average estimated number of seasonally-adjusted unemployed individuals in all of the 50 States and the District of Columbia over the same period."

When the American Rescue Plan was signed into law on March 11, 2021, CRS estimated Wisconsin's allocation to be $3.2 billion based upon BLS unemployment data covering "the 3- month period ending with December 2020." The Treasury Department, however, has chosen to utilize subsequent BLS data in the issuance of its interim final rule that lowers Wisconsin's allocation to $2.5 billion. We do not agree with this decision by the Department, and request that it be resolved immediately.

Similarly, section 9901 of the American Rescue Plan Act provides you the authority to separate payments to states into two tranches, but it does not require it: "The Secretary shall have the authority to withhold payment of up to 50 percent of the amount allocated to each State […] for a period of up to 12 months…". We do not support the implementation of a two-tranche payment structure, and request that full payment be made immediately – particularly in light of the current $700 million reduction in Wisconsin's allocation.

We look forward to working with you to expeditiously resolve these matters and stand ready to address any questions you may have.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan
Member of Congress

Title: Pocan Helps Protect Wisconsin Workers’ Pensions

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—In September 2020,Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)ledRepresentative Gwen Moore (WI-04),Representative Ron Kind (WI-03), and Senator Tammy Baldwinin a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to request a full and fair consideration to the State Wisconsin Investment Board's (SWIB) August 10th settlement proposal regarding State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Transferee v. Commissioner. The letter triggered a review by both the IRS and eventually the Department of Justice, eventually resulting in a more favorable settlement this week for the SWIB for less than the maximum potential liability."Over 650,000 public employees in Wisconsin rely on the Wisconsin Retirement System for their pensions, and this settlement ensures their retirement funds are not unnecessarily harmed,"said Congressman Pocan. "From first responders to teachers, Wisconsin's state and local workers depend on these funds for their retirement. Ensuring the continued financial health of the Wisconsin Retirement System is critically important to our state and we will continue to do everything possible to protect public employees' hard-earned pensions."

SWIB is a tax-exempt organization charged with the management of funds in Wisconsin's main public employee pension system, the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). Due to the WRS's unique "shared risk" structure, any payment made in connection with this case affects the retirement funds available to the WRS's 652,000 participants.

Since declaring 16 trade unions and other labor rights organizations illegal in the wake of their coup, the Burmese military has issued arrest warrants for at least 45 union leaders and carried out raids on multiple union leaders' homes and worker dorms. Just last week, soldiers raided the Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar's offices and arrested and disappeared Daw Myo Aye, the union's director. At least 22 active union members have been killed by the Burmese military and police since the February 1 coup."We join Burma's workers in their plea to multinational brands, including American companies, to respect workers' rights to demonstrate and refrain from firing these workers fighting for their country. We urge the Biden administration to keep diplomatic and economic pressure on the military regime—including through the thoughtful and deliberate imposition of additional sanctions that will cut off military resources without harming the Burmese people or impeding the delivery of humanitarian aid."Finally, we commend all Burmese citizens who continue to fight for their democracy in the face of injustice and violent repression.

Dear President Biden:

As Co-Chairs of the Congressional Labor Caucus, we thank you for your recent release of the American Jobs Plan. Like you, we believe that America's infrastructure needs have been neglected for far too long, that investments included in this once-in-a-generation piece of legislation should be targeted domestically, and that every worker deserves access to a good-paying union job. Toward that end, we write to offer our support for the following principles included in your American Jobs Plan proposal:

• Passing the PRO Act.
• Ensuring a prevailing wage in any funded project.
• Building, preserving, and retrofitting more than 2 million homes and buildings.
• Replacing 100% of lead pipes and service lines, supporting clean drinking water and wastewater system investments, and remediating PFAS contamination.
• Modernizing 20,000 miles of road and repairing 10,000 bridges.
• Committing $85 billion to public transit.
• Injecting $100 billion into the push for high-speed broadband for all Americans.
• Providing $100 billion for workforce development and worker protection programs.
• Creating 1 to 2 million new registered apprenticeship slots and growing preapprenticeship programs that are more inclusive and diverse.
• Modernizing America's education infrastructure including electrification of school buses.
• Investing $400 billion to expand access to quality and affordable home and communitybased care for the elderly and differently abled persons.
• Establishing a Child Care Growth and Innovation Fund and investing $25 billion in upgraded childcare facilities and childcare jobs.
• Ensuring that as many goods and materials as possible are made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag, U.S. crewed vessels.
• Curbing offshoring of jobs and ensuring multinational organizations pay their fair share.

Respectfully, we ask you to work with us to achieve the following priorities:

• Allowing the deduction of union dues.
• Cracking down on companies deducting union-busting efforts as business expenses.
• Requiring labor standards, at minimum prevailing wage, are a requirement for any and all government-supported construction activities, including those pursued through tax incentives, bonds, grants, loans, etc.
• Creating new and enhanced federal bridge corrosion remediation requirements.
• Ensuring states that receive education funds agree to "maintenance of effort" – providing a minimum amount of future education funding in exchange for federal funding.

MADISON, WI—Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI)released the following statement in response to the results of the union election for Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama."The brave workers in Bessemer, Alabama have made history in a state that is not known to be friendly to organized labor against a corporation that has built an empire off too often exploiting its workers. Despite a coordinated campaign of intimidation, union-busting and interference by Amazon, workers stood up to describe their awful working conditions, organized to form a union with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) and did not back down against Amazon's corruption."We support the RWDSU's filing an objection to the conduct of the election and related Unfair Labor Practice charges (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board—a right that they clearly have under the National Labor Relations Act. Amazon's workers deserve to be treated better than they have been on the warehouse floor and better than they have been during this election."This election has made one thing abundantly clear, workers across the country need the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Right now, the deck is stacked against working people and if the PRO Act was law, Amazon would not have gotten away with much of their union-busting tactics. In fact, Amazon workers would like already have a union.

Overturning the Governor's emergency order means Wisconsin could very likely lose $50 million per month in additional federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds that so many Wisconsinites have relied on during this pandemic."I urge the Republican-controlled legislature to step in for the people of Wisconsin to issue an emergency order to protect Wisconsinites and ensure we don't lose crucial food assistance for Wisconsin families. The state legislature has already opposed expanding Medicaid to cover nearly 91,000 additional low-income people—which would have saved Wisconsin $1.6 billion over the next two years. Pair that with the $50 million we will lose monthly in federal food benefits, and the Wisconsin GOP is not only forcing hundreds of thousands of families to go hungry, but they are being inexplicably fiscally irresponsible. Acting now will not only help people in need, but also protect taxpayers from an unneeded loss of federal funds. Any other action is fiscally irresponsible."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Agriculture has allocated additional emergency SNAP aid to states that have enacted emergency orders. Governor Evers' emergency order—which included the statewide mask mandate—ensured that Wisconsinites would receive millions in additional federal food assistance. Without the emergency order or additional action by the state legislature, Wisconsin could lose that aid.==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement regarding Colectivo workers organizing to form a union."Supporting essential workers means supporting their right to organize to form a union, collectively bargain, and fight for better wages, benefits & protections in the workplace. Every worker deserves a union and no worker should fear retaliation from an employer for organizing. Workers are the backbones of businesses like Wisconsin's Colectivo Coffee and CEOs should treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. No one should be laid off for organizing, no one should be targeted for demanding better workplace protections, and no one should feel unsafe in their own workplace. I stand in strong support of every worker's right to unionize—including the frontline workers at Colectivo Coffee."==
Title: Pocan, Lee & Auchincloss Lead 50 Members Urging Biden to Cut Defense Budget

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, co-chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus,Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) & Barbara Lee (D-CA), as well as Marine veteran Representative Jake Auchincloss (D-MA)led a letter of 50 colleagues to President Biden urging him to decrease the Pentagon's budget in his forthcoming proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2022. Under Donald Trump, the defense budget ballooned to $740 billion—a more than 20% increase during his tenure. As over 535,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19, now is the time to show the American people that the Biden-Harris administration prioritizes their health, housing, education, and jobs over billions more towards forever wars abroad."We cannot build back better if the Pentagon's budget remains just as large as it was under Donald Trump," saidRep. Pocan. "This crisis has proven that American national security should not be defined by the number of nuclear weapons collecting dust in storage, but by healthcare security, job security, housing security—the security of working families surviving with a roof over their heads, food on the table and money in the bank. We have a duty to invest in the American people more than we invest in defense contractor profits and Pentagon slush funds.""As we face a global pandemic and unprecedented economic crisis, the needs of American families far outweigh the need to continue feeding our bloated military defense budget,"said Rep. Lee. "Analysis from experts across the political spectrum show that we can make significant cuts to our defense budget without compromising our national security or reducing the support, pay or benefits provided to our men and women in uniform and their families. This issue has broad based support from faith groups, conservatives and progressives alike. As Co-chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus, we are calling on the President to rebalance our priorities to build a safer, peaceful, and more prosperous world, at home and abroad.""As the United States pivots away from the failed forever wars, our generation needs to lay down a marker for the Pentagon"said Rep. Auchincloss. "We can defend America and protect the global commons without the Trump increases to the budget. You don't have to be a veteran to know that the defense budget is out of control when you have a trillion-dollar fighter jet that can't dogfight."

Representatives Lee and Pocan previously led the National Defense Authorization Actamendmentto cut the defense budget in the 116thCongress.

President Joseph R. Biden

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, DC 20500

Dear President Biden:

As Members of the United States Congress sent to Washington by voters urging us to rebuke the values of the Trump Administration, we are eager to work with you to fulfill that mandate.

Our federal budget is a statement of our national values, and part of undoing the damage of the last four years is re-evaluating our spending priorities as a nation. That re-evaluation should begin with the Department of Defense. Hundreds of billions of dollars now directed to the military would have greater return if invested in diplomacy, humanitarian aid, global public health, sustainability initiatives, and basic research.

Recent reporting indicates that your first budget request to Congress will recommend the same level of Pentagon spending as the last fiscal year. While we are heartened that your Administration is not contemplating expanding the Pentagon's already inflated budget, our new Democratic majorities in Congress along with your Administration should go further. Rather than requesting a flat Pentagon budget, we urge you to seek a significantly reduced Pentagon topline. Thoughtful analysis from experts across the political spectrum shows that significant cuts can be achieved without reducing the support, pay or benefits provided to our men and women in uniform and their families. We could cut the Pentagon budget by more than ten percent and still spend more than the next ten largest militaries combined.

The United States' war on terror has lasted two decades and cost the U.S. approximately $6.4 trillion. Our men and women in uniform have served bravely and honorably. Yet, the premise of a military-centric foreign policy is a failure. We must end the forever wars, heal our veterans, and re-orient towards a holistic conception of national security that centers public health, climate change, and human rights.

You have spoken frequently about the need to not only reject the destruction of Trumpism, but to build things back better. A broad cross-section of voters and organizations, including conservative, faith-based and progressive groups, support responsible spending reductions at the Pentagon. The same voters who sent you to the White House on this promise sent us to Congress, expecting us to make this vision a reality and to chart a new course. Therefore, we strongly urge you to request a reduced Pentagon budget when you send your Fiscal Year 2022 budget to Congress.

Thank you for the consideration of this request, and we look forward to working with your Administration to implement the changes Americans expect from our leadership.

Sincerely,

Barbara Lee

Title: Pocan Celebrates Estimated $5.7 Billion for Wisconsin in American Rescue Plan
Date: March 16, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today,Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)announced the details of how much funding Wisconsin is estimated to receive through the passage of the American Rescue Plan. In total, Wisconsin isestimatedto receive over $5.7 billion in relief funding—$3.2 billion for state governments, $1.1 billion for counties, over $780 million for cities, and almost $400 million for other non-counties."I was proud to vote for the American Rescue Plan to ensure that almost $6 billion in relief funds comes back to the great state of Wisconsin,"said Congressman Pocan. "Wisconsinites have been demanding relief for months and Congress provided a long overdue stimulus to our state at all levels. These crucial funds will go towards supporting Wisconsin businesses, workers, and families at a time when they need our help the most."

In Wisconsin's 2ndDistrict, the county-by-county breakdown of estimated funds expected to be delivered directly to country governments, on top of payments directly to the state government, is:

• Dane: $106 million
• Green: $7.1 million
• Iowa: $4.5 million
• Lafayette: $3.2 million
• Rock: $31.6 million
• Sauk: $12.5 million

The American Rescue Plan outlines allowable uses for these funds, including: to respond to the pandemic or its negative economic impacts, including assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits, or aid to impacted industries such as tourism, travel, and hospitality; for premium pay to eligible workers performing essential work (as determined by each recipient government) during the pandemic, providing up to $13 per hour above regular wages; for the provision of government services to the extent of the reduction in revenue due to the pandemic (relative to revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year prior to the emergency); and to make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.==
Title: Pocan, Carson Lead Letter Urging Israel to Vaccinate Palestinians

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today,Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and André Carson (D-IN)led a letter of 17 colleagues to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken requesting the State department take additional action to ensure that the Israeli government provide COVID-19 vaccines and facilitate vaccination programs for Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza."The Israeli government has implemented one of the most successful vaccination plans in the world but has excluded Palestinians living under its own control in occupied territories,"said Congressman Pocan. "Israel has a legal responsibility, under international law, as the occupying power to provide the Palestinian people with necessary medical care—including the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The United States must stand up for the needs of Palestinian people during this global pandemic and ensure that they receive the same level of care from the Israeli government that we request in our own communities.""Unfortunately, Israel is not living up to its moral and legal responsibility to provide vaccines for Palestinians,"said Congressman Carson. "I hope that our letter to Secretary Blinken underscores to the Biden Administration the important role that the United States must play in pushing Israel to comply with international law. In addition, our letter highlights America's key role in defeating the pandemic worldwide. We must ensure all of our allies are doing everything possible to stop the spread of COVID-19."

According to the World Health Organization 200,000 Palestinians have already contracted COVID-19 and over 2,000 Palestinians have died. As of March 1, Israel has committed to providing 5,000 vaccines, but up to this point only provided 2,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.

March 15, 2021

The Honorable Anthony Blinken

Secretary of State

2201 C Street NW

Washington, DC 20520

Dear Secretary Blinken,

We write to request that the State Department take additional action to ensure that the Israeli government provide COVID-19 vaccines and facilitate vaccination programs for Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.

The recent announcement that Israel will vaccinate Palestinians with Israeli work permits is a step in the right direction. However, until Israel takes action to provide a comprehensive vaccination program for Palestinians, continued pressure is needed to ensure Israeli action to meet its obligation as an occupying entity. Even senior Israeli health officials have urged the government to vaccinate the entire Palestinian population.[1]

Over the last months COVID-19 rates in the West Bank and Gaza have risen significantly. According to the World Health Organization 200,000 Palestinians have already contracted COVID-19 and over 2,000 Palestinians have died. The humanitarian situation facing Palestinians in Gaza was already dire prior to the global coronavirus pandemic, where 90 percent of the population does not have regular access to clean water and more than 50 percent of the population lives in poverty.[2],[3]On February 28th, the schools in the West Bank were shut down due to a sharp rise in COVID-19 variant infections and intensive care units there reached 95% occupancy.[4]In the absence of a vaccination program in the West Bank and Gaza these numbers will continue to rise.

The Israeli government has implemented one of the most successful vaccination campaigns in the world. It has now vaccinated nearly 50% of its population and hopes to move towards a quick reopening as vaccination rates continue to increase. At the same time, Israel has not provided vaccines for Palestinians living under its control in the occupied Palestinian territories and in some instances has blocked the transfer of vaccines to Palestinian recipients. Even if Israel vaccinates the majority of its population, continued spread of COVID-19 in the West Bank and Gaza increases the risk of viral mutations and other challenges that may not remain limited to Palestinian areas.

As the occupying power, Israel has a legal responsibility under the Geneva Conventions to ensure that the occupied Palestinian population is provided with adequate medical care including "adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventative measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics" to "the fullest extent of the means available to it." Even though, under the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority maintains responsibility for the management of health care for Palestinian's living in the occupied territory, this does not negate Israeli obligations under international law, nor does it lessen Israel's control over Palestinian movement, access to medical imports, and other factors which directly impact vaccination efforts.

Outside of the legal and moral obligations it should be clear that it is in Israel's self-interest that Palestinians receive vaccines.

As of March 1, Israel has committed to providing 5,000 vaccines, but up to this point only provided 2,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority has worked to secure vaccines from the World Health Organization's COVAX initiative and other entities, however, they have so far secured less than 50,000 vaccine doses total for the millions of people living in the West Bank and Gaza.[5]This amount provides protection for less than one percent of the total Palestinian population. Additionally, Prime Minister Netanyahu had pledged at least twice as many doses to Honduras, Guatemala, Czech Republic and Syria than it has to the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.[6]If Israel continues to lead the world with its inoculation plan, it must send a moral message by assisting a population that has been deprived of the means to assist itself.

We understand that you have asked Israel to facilitate the transfer of vaccines to the West Bank and Gaza and we welcome and appreciate your intervention. We believe you must continue to push the Israeli government to take action until there is a comprehensive vaccination program in place for Palestinians living under Israeli rule.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan André Carson

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement ahead of the House of Representative's vote on the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act."The Protecting the Right to Organize Act is the strongest investment in American workers in decades. For far too long, workers have been stripped of their voices, losing their power to organize for better wages and benefits. With the PRO Act, we fight back against corporations and anti-union special interests that have attacked and eroded the labor movement for decades. Building a fair economy for anyone requires strong labor rights for everyone."This pandemic has proved that our economy is set up to benefit corporations and billionaires at the expense of workers in every industry. The PRO Act ensures every worker's right to unionize is protected by creating enforceable penalties for companies that break the law, expanding collective bargaining rights, and securing access to fair union elections that corporations must respect."In Wisconsin, we've seen the firsthand effects of the attacks on labor, as Republicans have gutted labor protections and turned my home state into a ‘right-to-work' state. The PRO Act would eliminate those state right-to-work-for-less laws and ensure that unions can receive the full support of the workers it represents."With stronger unions, workers can secure higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions. It's time to give workers the tools they need to survive in an economy rigged against them. Every worker deserves a union."

Title: Labor Caucus Votes to Protect Workers’ Right to Organize and Make Our Economy Work for Everyone
Date: March 9, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, members of the Labor Caucus voted to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, comprehensive labor legislation to protect workers' right to stand together and bargain for fairer wages, better benefits and safer workplaces. The Labor Caucus Co-Chairs – Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Steven Horsford (D-NV), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Linda T. Sánchez (D-CA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY) –endorsed the PRO Actin January."I know how important it is to give workers a voice and protect them from unfair labor practices because I lived it,"said Congressman Norcross, a former business agent for the IBEW Local 351 and President of the Southern New Jersey AFL-CIO."I fought for New Jerseyans at the negotiating table for decades. Workers win when they can band together and collectively bargain for safer workplaces, higher wages and better benefits. Today, my fellow co-chairs and I took a major leap forward in restoring fairness to an economy that's rigged against workers and building back better. As we continue to move forward with the Biden-Harris Administration, I urge the Senate to pass the PRO Act to level the playing field for American workers and their families.""The PRO Act is a monumental defense of workers that have been targeted by corporations and anti-union special interests for too long,"said Congressman Pocan."As a small business owner and union member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades for 30 years, I know how important it is that every worker has a union. This pandemic has proven that corporations put profits over the health and safety of their workers, so it's up to Congress to ensure that every worker's right to organize is protected and enforced. It's time to give workers the tools they need to survive in an economy rigged against them.""Unions don't just lift up workers and their families, they keep our economy and our communities strong,"said Congresswoman Dingell."For decades, labor and working families have weathered attacks to reduce their wages, erode their rights, and eliminate their workplace protections. But the PRO Act will restore economic power in the hands of the workers who carry our economy on their shoulders. Today, we begin to write a new chapter of American economic leadership by protecting labor unions and the workers they represent.""Over the past several decades the United States has created enormous wealth but working men and women have been left behind with stagnant wages,"said Congressman Suozzi."The PRO Act is the single most important piece of legislation to help restore the middle class and the American Dream.""After spending a decade helping to train Nevadans for good-paying union jobs in the hospitality and service industries, I know the power of unions to uplift working people and strengthen our middle class,"said Congressman Horsford, the former CEO of the Culinary Training Academy of Las Vegas."With the passage of the PRO Act, the Labor Caucus and House Democrats have advanced major legislative progress to restore fairness in our economy, protect the right to organize, and strengthen workplace protections for millions of unionized and non-unionized workers. President Biden is ready to sign the PRO Act into law, and I hope the Senate will move quickly to bring this important bill to his desk.""Middle class Americans and working families were being left behind before the COVID-19 pandemic – and they have suffered the most from job loss and layoffs over the last year,"said Congresswoman Sánchez."That's why it is more important than ever to protect our workers and their right to unionize as we rebuild our economy. Working people in Southern California and across the country work day in and day out and are still just barely scrapping by. The right to collectively bargain is critical in the fight for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Especially after decades of anti-labor attacks, we must protect workers from retaliation and intimidation. The PRO Act is an important step in making sure we acknowledge the dignity of working families in this country."

Unions are critical to increasing wages and addressing growing income inequality – with studies showing that union members earn on average19 percentmore than those with similar education, occupation, and experience in a non-union workplace. The PRO Act would reverse years of attacks on unions and restore fairness to the economy by strengthening the federal laws that protect workers' right to join a union and bargain for higher wages and better benefits.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Jimmy Gomez (D-CA)wrote a letter today to Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman and CEO of Facebook, demanding information as to why anti-vaccination activists that shut down Dodger Stadium—one of the largest COVID-19 vaccination centers in the nation—were allowed to organize and spread misinformation about COVID-19 on Facebook and what new actions Facebook will take to find and remove similar efforts on their platform. The letter comes after a Facebook page with almost 3,000 followers was able toorganizean anti-vaccination protest across multiple groups on the platform and successfully shut down Dodger Stadium this weekend—a vaccination center administering up to 8,000 vaccine shots a day."Big Tech corporations like Facebook have a duty to combat deadly misinformation as our nation combats a global pandemic that has taken the lives of over 430,000 people in our country,"said Representative Pocan. "Time and time again, we hearpromisesfrom companies like Facebook that vow to root out misinformation from their massive platforms and time and time again they fall short of doing their jobs. Los Angeles County leads the nation in COVID cases and deaths—with 6,411 dead in January alone. California and our country cannot afford anymore interruptions to our vaccine distribution, Facebook has a job to do, it's time they do it.""Facebook prides itself on being a place where users can make meaningful connections, but as we've seen over the weekend in my congressional district, ‘anti-vaxxers' leveraged this social network to disrupt the largest COVID-19 vaccination site in the City of Los Angeles during a time when the virus is killing a neighbor of ours every six minutes,"said Representative Gomez. "The conspiracy theories exchanged on Facebook on a daily basis are cultivating a perilous environment for our constituents during this public health emergency. Social networking companies like Facebook not only have to take responsibility for their role in this crisis, but also work to take swift action in ridding their platform of dangerous misinformation."

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, Labor CaucusCo-Chairs Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Linda Sánchez (D-CA), and Tom Suozzi (D-NY)released the following statement announcing the Caucus' endorsement of a slate of pro-labor bills introduced in Congress: The Raise the Wage Act, the National Apprenticeship Act, and the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act."The Labor Caucus is proud to endorse these pro-union, pro-worker bills that will not only strengthen our labor movement, but will ensure workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."It has been over a decade since Congress raised the federal minimum wage, and the Raise the Wage Act is the first step in making a living wage a reality for every worker in this country. The National Apprenticeship Act invests over $3 billion into apprenticeship opportunities and will create almost one million new Registered Apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship positions—building a reliable pipeline of union jobs for years. Finally, the PRO Act would reverse decades of anti-union policies and strengthen our labor movement by eliminating so-called "right-to-work" laws, ensuring every worker's right to unionize is protected by creating enforceable penalties for companies that break the law, expanding collective bargaining rights, and securing access to fair union elections."At a time when workers continue to suffer through an economic crisis and public health disaster, it is integral that we fight to protect their right to unionize, increase their wages, invest in union jobs and protect their health and safety in the workplace. With these bills, we can finally tip the scales back towards the American worker."###==
Title: Pocan Tells State Legislature Not to Overturn Mask Mandate
Date: January 28, 2021
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI–Congressman Mark Pocan(WI-02)released the following statement in response to the Wisconsin State Legislature voting to overturn Governor Tony Evers' statewide mask mandate."There is no excuse for Wisconsin potentially being one of only ten states without a statewide mask mandate. With new variants of COVID-19 emerging from England, South Africa and Brazil, masking is the most effective defense we have against this pandemic as vaccines are still in the early stages of rollout."Over and over again, we hear excuses from Republican state leaders that this mask mandate is an ‘overreach' by the Governor. If that is the honest objection, then the legislature should immediately pass a bill themselves requiring masks to be worn statewide. If this is simply about appealing to the lowest common denominator of science deniers for political purposes, then shame on our legislature. Without a mask mandate, too many Wisconsinites will have long-term health consequences or die, our rates will increase again, and businesses will have even more difficulties in recovering economically. We cannot afford this kind of raw partisanship."==

MADISON, WI–Congressman Mark Pocan(WI-02)released the following statement in response to President Joe Biden signing an executive order strengthening the federal government's "Buy American" rules."At a time when American businesses, manufacturing, and workers are facing an economic crisis, our government has a duty to invest in their futures. President Biden's executive order promoting a "Buy American" agenda is welcome news for American workers and businesses that desperately need federal investments for their survival. President Trump's failed promises of encouraging and supporting American workers and businesses were filled with loopholes exploited by his corporate friends. President Biden is closing those loopholes and appointing a new position to limit waivers granted to companies seeking to circumvent "Buy American" rules."Since my days in the Wisconsin State Assembly through my time in the House, I have championed numerous pieces of legislation to ensure that American taxpayer dollars go to American manufacturing and jobs—instead of outsourcing federal contracting to companies with minimal labor standards or poverty wages. America needs a massive relief in the coming months, and we owe it to taxpayers to ensure that recovery supports American union jobs, American manufacturing and American small businesses."==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, Labor CaucusCo-Chairs Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Steven Horsford (D-NV), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Linda Sánchez (D-CA), and Tom Suozzi (D-NY)released the following statement supporting President Biden's firing of National Labor Relation Board (NLRB) General Counsel Peter Robb."The Congressional Labor Caucus strongly supports President Biden's removal of Peter Robb from his position as General Counsel of the NLRB. Peter Robb is an anti-union extremist appointed by Donald Trump to undermine organized labor and the rights of workers. Since his appointment, he has willfully failed to do his duty to protect union rights, interfered in union elections, and refused to hold employers accountable for their treatment of workers."This is a major step forward to reverse the previous administration's destructive anti-union policies and a welcome sign for working families that desperately need a President committed to their survival. We look forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to pass legislation that strengthens unions, raises wages, and protects workers."###==

The Labor Caucus is ready to work with the labor movement and the Biden-Harris Administration to strengthen unions, fight for pandemic relief and build back a better, brighter future for America's workers.""I want to applaud the Labor Caucus Co-chairs. You've united 75 members of Congress together in this Labor Caucus, which sends a strong signal to those of us working every day to grow the labor movement,"said AFL-CIO President Trumka. "We need a Workers First Agenda that starts with passing the PRO Act for worker empowerment, worker safety, good union jobs, racial justice and economic security.""I want to thank Representatives Suozzi, Norcross, Dingell, Horsford, Pocan and Sánchez for all that they have done to bring together a dynamic Labor Caucus to seize the moment and champion a legislative agenda that puts power and prosperity in the hands of working people,"said AFT President Randi Weingarten."In this time of deep national crisis, there's no more essential task than protecting democracy and delivering the relief and tools for workers to thrive. The path to a better America runs through the labor movement, as the largest organized force for equality and justice. With this united caucus in place, we can repair our frayed national fabric and place workers' concerns at the center of our debates and decision-making."

The Labor Caucus, intended to advance the needs of the labor movement, combat the issues facing working families and connect legislators directly with unions and union leaders, was announced in November and now has 75 members.==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The Labor Caucus announced four additional co-chairs today,Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Steven Horsford (D-NV), Linda Sanchez (D-CA),andTom Suozzi (D-NY)will joinCongressmen Mark Pocan(D-WI)andDonald Norcross (D-NJ)as co-chairs of the Labor Caucus.

In order to unite pro-worker efforts in Congress, we are combining the existing Labor and Working Families Caucus, as well as another labor-focused caucus members were considering forming, under one cohesive banner. Formed this month, the Labor Caucus now has over 50 members."A Biden-Harris administration is an opportunity for Congress to centralize the needs of the labor movement and working families once again,"said Congressman Pocan. "Donald Trump has greenlighted union-busting, weakened labor rights, and refused to protect workers livelihoods or safety during this pandemic. I am eager to begin work with my co-chairs to reverse his actions and ensure working people have a voice in Congress again.""While the Trump Administration has tried to dismantle labor rights, the incoming Biden-Harris Administration understands the dignity of work and knows that America succeeds when workers succeed,"said Congressman Norcross,a proud, card-carrying member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) for over 40 years. "Everyone should have a voice in their workplace to advocate for fair wages and safe spaces, and the Labor Caucus will advance the cause of working families by being their voice in Congress. I look forward to working together with my co-chairs and our brothers and sisters in the labor movement to strengthen unions and build a bright future for America's workers.""The formation of the Labor Caucus is great news for working families across this country, and I welcome my like-minded colleagues to leadership on these key issues,"said Congresswoman Linda Sánchez. "I've had the privilege to lead the Labor and Working Families Caucus for more than a decade, where we have helped members speak with one voice on important issues. I'm glad this work will continue under this new banner, which will be especially important as we usher in the Biden-Harris administration and begin to undo the incredible damage of the last four years. As a card-carrying union member, my work in Congress has always put working families first. Now, more than ever, I won't stop fighting for them and the relief they've earned.""Working families will lead our recovery from this pandemic and the economic devastation it has caused,"said Congresswoman Dingell. "In Michigan, we know that those efforts must include strong union protections, revitalized labor laws, and an intentional legislative focus on the everyday issues that matter most to working Americans. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, our Labor Caucus will demand economic justice for our workers in every corner of this country.""I'm honored to co-chair the new House Labor Caucus. In these challenging times, workers' rights and protections are important now more than ever. Creating good-paying jobs, protecting healthcare and security in retirement for working families should be a top focus in the next Congress,"said Congressman Horsford. "Union workers built and continue to be the backbone of my home state of Nevada, and I look forward to fighting for them and their families.""Over the past several decades the United States has created enormous wealth but working men and women have been left behind with stagnant wages. Climate change, immigration, civil rights, trade, economic growth and every other issue must be analyzed through a pro-labor perspective,"said Congressman Suozzi. "The American Dream, where hard work is rewarded with wages sufficient to guarantee a home, health insurance, children's education and retirement security, is no longer in reach for too many. We must reclaim the American Dream and that starts with a pro-labor, pro-growth agenda. Our Labor Caucus will work with the Biden Administration, our diverse labor unions, and other caucuses and committees of jurisdictions to advocate for a new, robust, middle class and all those that aspire to be part of it."###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Congressmen Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Donald Norcross (D-NJ)are announcing the creation of the Labor Caucus, intended to advance the needs of the labor movement, combat the issues facing working families, and connect legislators directly with unions and union leaders. The new caucus will be organized by union members of Congress—Representatives Pocan and Norcross are both decades-long union members in the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), respectively."President-Elect Joe Biden's new administration gives the Democratic Party the opportunity to reprioritize working families at the center of our legislative agenda,"said Congressman Pocan. "Under Donald Trump, we've seen the erosion of labor rights, rise in union-busting, and the prioritization of corporate profits over working people's livelihoods and safety. In the 117thCongress, we must reaffirm our dedication to strengthening unions and helping works by urgently passing legislation like the PRO Act and the Raise the Wage Act. It's time for working people to have a voice in Congress again.""Labor has shaped my life, taking me from the construction site to Congress,"said Congressman Norcross."While the Trump Administration has tried to diminish labor rights, President-Elect Joe Biden's incoming Administration understands the dignity of work and that workers' rights are human rights. Every American worker should have the opportunity to earn a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, and working families deserve a bigger voice in Congress. I look forward to working together with our brothers and sisters in Labor to pass legislation for American workers and their futures.""It is absolutely imperative that we return this country back into the hands of working people and the Labor Caucus will do just that," saidShane Larson, Senior Director for Government Affairs and Policy at the Communications Workers of America."Congressman Pocan and Norcross are card-carrying union members and we are proud to support their efforts to prioritize workers' rights and the labor movement in Congress. The Democratic Party has long been the party of unions and working families, and the Labor Caucus will ensure that legacy endures in every Congress to come."###==
Title: Pocan Announces RALLIES Act

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), today announced the Refusal to Accept Losses or Liability In Every Situation Act (RALLIES) Act, which would prevent liability waivers from being enforced for indoor gatherings of 1,000 or more people if the 14-day COVID case trend is increasing in the locality the gathering is being held. President Trump is planning to host his first large rally since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic this Saturday at an indoor arena in Tulsa, OK. The Trump campaign is requiring all attendees to sign liability waivers due to the high likelihood of contracting COVID-19."Since the beginning of this pandemic, the President has refused to take ownership over his administration's disastrous response to COVID-19,"said Congressman Pocan. "As we see cases continue to rise—including over 300 new cases in Tulsa County over the last week alone—this President wants the right to endanger thousands of people at an indoor stadium with impunity. We refuse to let a candidate for re-election threaten the lives of the people of this country for political gain. With over 2 million COVID cases in the United States and over 116,000 deaths, I would hope this president's actions would prioritize recovery, not a resurgence in cases nationwide."

Congressman Pocanpreviouslywrote to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield last week, asking whether he believes states and localities should permit large indoor public events like the rally, attended by thousands of participants not practicing recommended social distancing or face-covering practices—particularly if organizers require liability waivers to attend due to the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the absence of a response from the CDC, the Congressman introduced the RALLIES Act to prevent the president from evading accountability for his dangerous actions.

From housing to healthcare, we need equity in all areas of American life. The House passed the Equality Act over a year ago, but the Senate has refused to affirm the rights of LGBTQ people in this country.

Dr. Robert R. Redfield

Director

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

1600 Clifton Road

Atlanta, GA 30329

Dear Director Redfield:

As a leading public health official and Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should states and localities permit large indoor public events attended by thousands of participants not practicing recommended social distancing or face-covering practices, particularly if organizers require liability waivers to attend due to the likelihood of contracting COVID-19?

Common sense, science, and current data lead me to believe that such indoor gatherings should not be permitted, but I am interested in your professional opinion.

More than half of the states in America are experiencing an increase in new daily cases of COVID-19.[1]Eight states have more than a 50 percent increase in daily cases when compared to two weeks ago, and Arkansas, Utah, South Carolina, and Oregon all have more than a 100 percent increase. Arizona has the unique distinction of leading all states with a 232 percent increase in coronavirus cases compared to two weeks ago.

Now is not the time to yield to talking points, Dr. Redfield. Cases are increasing, and so will deaths. As CDC Director, I implore you to be honest with every American about the dangers of large indoor gatherings and signing their liability protections away, and to lead the President and other elected officials in a manner consistent with current data. To operate in any other manner will not only irrevocably stain any legacy of public service you leave behind, it will cost Americans their lives.

Sincerely

Mark Pocan

Title: Pocan Introduces Police Training and Accountability Act
Date: June 5, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—As the nation mourns the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of police violence, Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI) is introducing the Police Training and Accountability Act. The bill would establish a national training standard for all law enforcement officers and a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights for anyone having contact with law enforcement. A civilian commission would be named to set standards of training for police, to bridge the wide gaps of what training for law enforcement looks like nationwide. The act would require federal funding to police departments to be contingent on these standards being met."The police violence we've seen in the past month is tolerated long before it is called out, and the people of this country are fed up with systemic racial injustice constantly being met with inaction,"said Congressman Pocan. "Everyone needs to believe that all law enforcement officers have met national standardized requirements for training and civilian interaction. Federal dollars should not go to police that communities simply do not trust. From de-escalation to use of lethal force, police nationwide must meet new standards before they receive additional funding from the federal government."

The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG), is the largest source of federal funds for state and local law enforcement agencies—$547.2 million were appropriated for the program in FY2020. The Police Accountability and Funding Act would require those federal funds to be conditional on police departments meeting the training requirement and standards created by a civilian commission. Those requirements must include, at minimum, standards for: a minimum level of education attainment and training hours, use of force, use of lethal force, implicit bias, conflict resolution, mediation, and de-escalation practices, pursuit, video technology, stop and search procedures, and intervention programs.

The bill would also require police departments to adhere to a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights prior to receiving any Byrne JAG funding."Communities should not only understand what to expect from interactions with law enforcement, but they should have a voice in setting those expectations,"continued Pocan. "A Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights lays out national standards and expectations for anyone in contact with law enforcement, no matter where they live in our country. We need equal enforcement of the law for everyone.""From Florida to Washington, Maine to California, there should be a common standard for law enforcement. We cannot continue to fund new initiatives for police departments to improve while the same systemic problems continue,"said Pocan. "Police departments nationwide must use existing funds to meet these new standards. Law enforcement must be held accountable to the standards of the community they are tasked to serve and protect. Anything less is a continuation of injustice."

Title: Pocan & Baldwin to FEMA: “We Need Better Emergency Management for Wisconsin NOW”
Date: June 1, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—This morning,Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)sent a letter to Peter Gaynor, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator, detailing continued problems with the amount and usability of medical and testing supplies FEMA has delivered to Wisconsin. FEMA's support is critical to Wisconsin's ability to respond to the coronavirus. But, without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and supplies from the federal government, Wisconsin will be left even more vulnerable in the face of this global pandemic that has already taken the lives of over 100,000 Americans."This administration turned its back on the people of Wisconsin early on in this pandemic,"said Congressman Mark Pocan. "First, the Trump administration failed to get our state the supplies it needs to expand testing and protect our communities. Then, when they finally get us supplies, they send many that are unusable for the pandemic. This pattern of apparent negligence from the top has a human cost and our state cannot tolerate this administration's incompetence any longer.""President Trump has not provided Wisconsin all the medical supplies we have requested,"said Senator Tammy Baldwin. "Shortchanging Wisconsin and sending us unusable medical supplies is simply not acceptable and it's not going to help our state move forward. The President's mismanagement of the medical supply chain throughout this pandemic is just one of the many failures of this administration's response to the public health crisis we continue to face. This White House needs deliver the medical supplies Wisconsin desperately needs to shut down this pandemic, safely reopen our economy and put people back to work."

There were systematic problems in late March and April with getting supplies to Wisconsin. There appeared to be a renewed interest, specifically from FEMA, in getting supplies to the states in later April, but according to actual records of items received, the problems continue.

Most recently, Governor Tony Evers laid out the supplies that state needed in an April 30 letter to FEMA. Almost a month later, we've received only about 22% of what we have requested—including zero surgical gowns.

Even when Wisconsin has received supplies from FEMA, some of the most critical materials have been completely unusable. 17,000 saline tubes are too short to transport the nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs used for the majority of COVID-19 tests, and 67,983 foam applicators that cannot be used for NP swabs either."We still are not getting the supplies we need in the quantities necessary to fight Covid-19,"continued Congressman Pocan. "And too often, when we received supplies, they weren't usable for the purposes required. More than 60 days into a national emergency, these mistakes cannot continue to be made – they will cost human lives."

In some cases, confusion has been the major problem. The federal government has failed to provide adequate supplies for our state's clinical and private labs—paralyzing our ability to expand testing capacity statewide. Originally, FEMA was the procurer of tests and the reagents needed to run them, then it became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but during that shift the majority of labs in the state were refused help. The majority of labs conducting COVID-19 tests in Wisconsin are clinical or private labs experiencing severe shortages of reagents, yet this administration refuses to supply those reagents."FEMA has been very helpful in setting up testing facilities in several parts of Wisconsin which has been appreciated,"noted Congressman Pocan. "But this far into the pandemic, we need far quicker and more robust help in getting PPE, reagents and other supplies to Wisconsin and the rest of the nation. That's the real emergency management we need from this White House."

Title: Pocan, Blunt Rochester & Crist Introduce COVID-19 Emergency Production Act
Date: May 21, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Charlie Crist (D-FL) will be introducing the COVID-19 Emergency Production Act tomorrow. The bill allows, by a vote of Congress, to force the President to use the Defense Production Act (DPA). Specifically, it requires him to use the DPA to designate PPE, all testing supplies and any future COVID-19 vaccine as critical material essential to the national defense. It would direct materials to be produced and distributed to states and territories based on their requests for supplies and in proportion to their populations.

The first COVID-19 case in America was reported on January 20, but four months later states and hospitals are still reporting shortages of critical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 tests due to this administration's failure to act on a national level to combat this pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that we have tested less than 4% of our country's population and 13% of those we have tested have come back positive. The President has refused to use the full force of the Defense Production Act to combat this crisis on the grand scale it demands. We need to massively ramp up our testing and supply production to support the states and hospitals that have repeatedly requested them."The President's complete failure to respond to this crisis in a national manner has led to over 1.5 million cases and over 90,000 deaths in the country,"said Congressman Pocan. "For months, states have begged for additional testing supplies and PPE and received crumbs from this administration in response. We cannot reopen states without expanding testing capacity nationwide—it's just that simple. This president has refused to act as a leader and instead delights in states competing for scarce supplies. Our nation won't survive without national action.""For the country to reopen and recover, we need a strong strategy that will ensure testing supplies and PPE are available to everyone that needs it," saidCongresswoman Blunt Rochester. "But we must also put a plan in place to ensure we will be ready and able to produce and efficiently distribute a future vaccine. This bill will not only solve the real shortages experienced today, it will allow the President to use the Defense Production Act proactively to encourage the right investments and developments that so the issues with PPE and testing don't affect vaccine deployment. The health and safety of our communities are depending on us all to work together and get America back on track.""We still don't have enough tests for everyone who wants one and our hospitals, health agencies, and first responders continue to compete with each other and the rest of the world for personal protective equipment. All 50 states are in some stage of reopening, and shortages will get worse if we see another spike,"said Congressman Crist. "Everybody should have access to testing; every worker should have the PPE they need to do their jobs safely; and eventually, everyone should be able to get a vaccine. If the President won't use his authority under the Defense Production Act to get Americans what we need to beat this virus, Congress must step in and require it."

Title: Pocan, Lee Lead 29 Dems Demanding Defense Spending Decrease
Date: May 19, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) led a group of 29 Democrats demanding that this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorize a level of spending below last year's budget, in a letter to House Armed Services Committee (HASC) leadership this morning.

Since the start of the Trump administration, defense spending has increased every year—over $100 billion, almost 20%, in three years. Now more than ever, in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot allow this ballooning spending to be directed towards this president's warmongering. Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and we must focus our spending efforts on the expansion of testing, contact tracing, treatment, vaccine development and relief for the people of this country. Last year's NDAA authorized $738 billion in defense spending for FY20, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got 1/90thof that: less than $8 billion."We are facing a crisis in this country and billions of dollars in defense spending increases won't solve it,"said Congressman Pocan. "Year after year, we see taxpayer dollars line the pocket of defense contractors instead of supporting the American public. The enemy we're fighting right now is COVID-19, so our sole focus should be on expanding testing, tracing and treatment, funding towards vaccine development, and relief for the American people. Increasing defense spending now would be a slap in the face to the families of over 90,000 Americans that have died from this virus.""Year after year, the Pentagon budget has inflated to historic levels while the vital needs of everyday people are left unmet,"said Congresswoman Lee. "The COVID pandemic has laid bare how America has failed to make its budgets reflect the real needs of our everyday families. It's long past time that we address our bloated military budget and retarget resources towards policies and programs that matter the most for keeping us safe, healthy, and secure."

Last year's House NDAA passed out of the House of Representatives in July with zero Republican votes and eight Democratic "NO" votes—both Pocan and Lee voted against last year's defense spending increase.Republicans withstanding, 19 Democrats would need to vote "NO" this year for the bill to fail. 29 Democrats signed this letter.

This letter was co-signed by Representatives Blumenauer (D-OE), Cohen (D-TN), DeFazio (D-OR), DeGette (D-CO), Espaillat (D-NY), Evans (D-PA), J. Garcia (D-IL), Grijalva (D-AZ), Huffman (D-CA), Jayapal (D-WA), H. Johnson (D-GA), Kennedy (D-MA), Khanna (D-CA), A.

WASHINGTON, DC–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)yesterday sent a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue urging him to take immediate action to help dairy farmers suffering economic hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic.

April 2, 2020

The Honorable Sonny Perdue

Secretary

U.S. Department of Agriculture

1400 Independence Avenue, S.W.

Washington, D.C. 20250

Dear Secretary Perdue:

Thank you for your work supporting American farmers as our nation grapples with the COVID-19 outbreak. As you are aware, the pandemic and resulting economic fallout has put tremendous strain on agricultural producers. I am particularly concerned about the impact of this outbreak on Wisconsin dairy producers, some of whom have already been forced to dispose of milk because of reduced demand. I urge you to take the following steps to help shore up this critical industry and ensure Americans have continued access to dairy products:

Reopen Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) Signups

Outlook for dairy prices has changed significantly since producers last had the opportunity to sign up for DMC. Giving producers the opportunity to sign up now would allow more producers to enroll in the program and allow currently enrolled producers to select coverage that better suits their needs.

Purchase Dairy Products

The recently enacted CARES Act significantly expanded USDA's ability to purchase agricultural products. It is critical that you use this power to purchase dairy products and support producers so they can weather this difficult time.

Taking these steps would be a critical first step towards stabilizing the dairy economy. Thank you again for your work to address this pandemic. I look forward to continuing to work with you to support agricultural producers during this challenging time.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan

Member of Congress

Records of ICE's now infamous history of mistreating immigrants are a necessary tool in uncovering the agency's abuse and malpractice on behalf of the Trump administration and NARA is now threatening to destroy those archives. Documentation slated to be destroyed includes information on detainee deaths, sexual assault and abuse, civil rights violations, inhumane solitary confinement practices and violations of ICE's own detention standards."At a moment when the American public is demanding full transparency of the government's actions, allowing ICE to destroy records of its abuses is wholly unacceptable," saidCongressman Pocan. "As a Congressman, I cannot hold this cruel agency accountable if I have no records of their cruelty. This is a blatant attempt to erase the Trump administration's racist and inhumane immigration policies. There is no excuse that would make this decision tolerable. NARA needs to cease its partisan antics and do its duty to preserve our nation's records—good and bad."

March 31, 2020

Dear Mr. Ferriero, Mr. Albence, Mr. Stern and Mr. Pham:

I write to urge you not to proceed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's document destruction schedule. By law, the National Archives and Records Administration may only approve an agency's proposed document destruction schedule if the documents "do not, or will not after the lapse of the period specified, have sufficient administration, legal, research or other value to warrant their continued preservation by the Government."[1]As a Member of Congress, I rely on access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) records that would be destroyed this year under this place to conduct oversight of the agency's activities. Because the records continue to have legal and research value to Members of Congress, you must not move forward with the schedule of document destruction.

Without access to the records set to be destroyed under ICE's plan, it would be impossible to fulfill my obligation to hold ICE accountable for abuse and mistreatment of its detainees. ICE's document destruction schedule would allow the agency to destroy documentation of detainee deaths, sexual assault and abuse, civil rights violations, inhumane solitary confinement practices and violations of its own detention standards. As a Member of Congress, holding ICE accountable for such abuses is an important part of my job, and I cannot effectively do my job if ICE and NARA move forward with destroying these documents. I urge you to abandon your document destruction schedule.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan

Member of Congress

Title: Pocan, DeLauro to Introduce Layoff Prevention Bills
Date: March 20, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—Today,Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)andCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03)announced they will introduce two bills to prevent working people from being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic. ThePreventing Layoffs During a Public Health Emergency Actand theLayoff Prevention Actwould provide federal support for states' work sharing programs, which give employers the flexibility they need to maintain their workforce and keep American workers on the job. Struggling companies will be able to reduce hours instead of their workforce—helping them save on rehiring costs—while employees will keep their jobs and receive a portion of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits to make up for lost wages.

DeLauro championed these provisions during the financial crisis and secured inclusion of parts of theLayoff Prevention Actin theMiddle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. By 2016, work sharing programs were established in 29 states, including Connecticut. However, the federal financing and grants lapsed in August 2015 despite DeLauro'seffortsto extend them."Businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs right now because of the coronavirus pandemic,"said Congresswoman DeLauro."Working people and families are facing an unprecedented threat to their economic security, and many do not know how they are going to be able to put food on the table and pay their bills. Fortunately, Congress can help make a difference in people's lives right now. By expanding federal support for work sharing programs, workers would be able to keep their jobs and companies can avert layoffs and costly rehiring. Moreover, with fewer workers unemployed, there is less of a burden on the Unemployment Insurance benefits system—which is currently being strained in many states. Work sharing programs were a bright spot in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and we should immediately reinstate federal support for them in the next coronavirus response package.""Work sharing is one of the most impactful tools we can utilize to reduce widespread layoffs nationally during this pandemic,"said Congressman Pocan."A public health emergency doesn't mean we have to leave small businesses to face this crisis alone. More than half of all states already have work sharing programs that give small businesses and their workers the flexibility to reduce employee hours while allowing workers to collect partial unemployment insurance to compensate for lower hours. At a time when workers live in fear of losing their next paycheck, we must do everything in our power to protect their livelihoods."

DeLauro serves as Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Labor, and Pocan serves as a Member of the Subcommittee.

WASHINGTON, DC–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and David Cicilline (RI-01)today sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, requesting direct and immediate financial assistance to small businesses, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and gig economy workers in the House's next legislative package to combat the effects of the coronavirus outbreak."We want to ensure that working people—from small businesses to gig workers and independent contractors—are able to survive now," saidCongressman Pocan. "As a small business owner myself, I have seen firsthand the effects of this outbreak on a business owner's ability to afford expenses and pay employees. It is imperative that any further action the House takes includes direct relief for small businesses.""Small businesses and their employees are the backbone of our economy. We have an obligation to do everything we can to keep them afloat during this unprecedented crisis,"Congressman Cicillinesaid. "As Congress works to provide additional emergency funding in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it's crucial that we take steps to provide direct assistance to small businesses."

The letter was also co-signed by Representatives: Lisa Blunt Rochester (DE), Suzanne Bonamici (OR), André Carson (IN) , Yvette D. Clarke (NY), Gilbert R.

Rush (IL), Darren Soto (FL), Susan Wild (PA).

See the full letter below andhere.

Dear Speaker Pelosi,

Thank you for your leadership during this global pandemic. As you develop a third legislative package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, we encourage you to include additional, immediate, and direct financial assistance to America's millions of small businesses, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and gig economy workers.

The initial House-passed coronavirus measures included strong first steps to begin to ensure many workers are provided the resources they need to survive lost wages during this time. Unfortunately, the tax credits offered to impacted employers are unlikely to address the revenue loss that will occur in the coming months. Small business enterprises will struggle to pay rent, service existing debt, cover utilities, continue to pay insurance, and meet the myriad other expenses they face.

As Congress moves toward a third coronavirus legislative package, we encourage the inclusion of direct cash assistance to cover lost expenses during a time of forced closure or limited operations that is on a scale consistent with the cash assistance likely to be provided to workers soon. We are pleased that policy discussions for the initial coronavirus packages focused on workers, but we fear that if small business concerns aren't addressed in the near-term workers may not have jobs to return to when this pandemic ends. We also believe that small business interests are just as deserving of assistance as large business interests, particularly when they are far more likely to have paid a larger relative share of their income in federal taxes.

We thank you for your consideration of these views and look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of America's workers, independent contractors, sole proprietors, gig economy workers, and small business community.==

WASHINGTON, DC–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today sent a letter to Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, to follow-up on previous outreach to the Department of Defense (DoD) on the lack of coronavirus testing capabilities available to military personnel stationed abroad as well as seeking additional information about the DoD's response strategies to the coronavirus outbreak.

See the full letter below andhere.

March 13, 2020

Dr. Mark T. Esper

Secretary of Defense

United States of America

1000 Defense Pentagon

Washington, DC 20301

Dear Secretary Esper:

Global pandemics know no boundaries, neither should responses to them. For that reason, I write to inquire about the Department of Defense's (DOD) preparedness and response planning for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Domestically, America's response to COVID-19 has been disturbing. The severity of the threat has been underestimated and understated from the beginning; and, as a result, the Administration has proven incapable of developing a coherent strategy to combat the disease.

In times such as this, it is imperative that every American receive the care they need. That is especially true for our servicemembers who will inevitably be called upon to assist in the global response to COVID-19. Unfortunately, however, I have been told that there are members of our military stationed in Afghanistan who have flu-like symptoms, have tested negative for the flu, and are being denied testing for COVID-19. If true, this is deeply distressing and must be remedied immediately. Senior military officials who travel from installation to installation may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of COVID-19 among servicemembers serving in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.

Therefore, I wish to know the following:

1. Does DOD have COVID-19 tests?
2. If so, how many?
3. How many tests can DOD labs process per day?
4. Can any servicemember who wishes to be tested for COVID-19 receive a test?
5. Has any servicemember who has requested a test for COVID-19 been denied a test for COVID-19?
6. If so, how many?
7. How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed abroad?
8. How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed in Afghanistan?
9. How many servicemembers currently have COVID-19?
10. How many servicemembers have been quarantined because of COVID-19 concerns or exposure?
11. Because sample specimens taken as part of COVID-19 test collections typically degrade beyond many labs' testing capabilities within 72 hours, how many servicemembers would currently be unable to have a collected sample tested for COVID-19 within 72 hours of collection?
12. What new Defense-wide procedures have you implemented in response to COVID-19?
13. What is the implementation date for each of the procedures listed in response to the previous question?
14. Is DOD concerned about any possible drug shortage during this COVID-19 outbreak?
15. If so, what steps are being taken to address those concerns?
16. What medical supplies and medical care capacity (such as medical care facilities, hospitals, isolation units, intensive care beds, etc.) for servicemembers do you anticipate will be most stressed during this pandemic?
17. Finally, how much additional funding do you anticipate requesting from Congress in order to adequately respond to threats posed by COVID-19?

I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and encourage you to publicly announce to all servicemembers, including their families, the COVID-19 procedures you have established and the level of care they can expect to receive. Given the seriousness of this inquiry, I request a response to the questions contained in this letter in no less than 48 hours.==
Title: Pocan Receives CDC Answers on Coronavirus Testing Capacity

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded today to Rep. Pocan's inquiry into lab capacity to process coronavirus tests in the United States."After questioning the CDC about lab capacity to process coronavirus tests in the United States, today they replied with the following answers:

• Every state public health lab has the CDC test validated and up and running.CDC has the capacity to run 350 a day and are in the process of standing up more CDC labs to increase CDC's capacity.As of 3/12, 81 state and local public health labs have the CDC diagnostic test validated and running.The throughput and daily capacity of those labs is a moving target, but on an upward trajectory. The state and local public health labs are likely capable of processing at least 2,000 tests a day, and this capacity will only increase.This week, higher throughput testing platforms were authorized for use under our Emergency Use Authorization; as a result the state and public health laboratories are bringing more daily testing capacity online.

• This week, higher throughput testing platforms were authorized for use under our Emergency Use Authorization; as a result the state and public health laboratories are bringing more daily testing capacity online.
• While the state and local testing capacity is increasing, it will ultimately be dwarfed as more commercial sector testing becomes available.Lab Corp, MAYO, Quest, and ARUP are already up and running.Quest reports it can currently run 1300 a day.LabCorp reports it can run hundreds a day and reports that it will be capable of running thousands of test a day as it ramps up.Mayo reports it can run 300-500 a dayARUP, which started testing on 3/12, projects capacity of running 1,000-2,000 tests a day.We anticipate major commercial diagnostic manufacturers to obtain FDA Emergency Use Authorization for their own COVID-19 diagnostics, which will increase daily testing capacity by thousands of tests a day.
• Lab Corp, MAYO, Quest, and ARUP are already up and running.Quest reports it can currently run 1300 a day.LabCorp reports it can run hundreds a day and reports that it will be capable of running thousands of test a day as it ramps up.Mayo reports it can run 300-500 a dayARUP, which started testing on 3/12, projects capacity of running 1,000-2,000 tests a day.

• We anticipate major commercial diagnostic manufacturers to obtain FDA Emergency Use Authorization for their own COVID-19 diagnostics, which will increase daily testing capacity by thousands of tests a day."Unfortunately, this response is incomplete and still fails to give us a complete picture of the country's ability to process coronavirus tests. We continue to follow former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb's daily tracking of these numbers. Hisestimatesof coronavirus testing capacity across the country is that 25,175 people can be tested per day, as of Friday 3/13, 9:00 AM."As of Wednesday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has noted that 2.5 million coronavirus tests were available, and since multiple tests are needed per person, he explained that these are only enough to test 989,000 people. However, if we can only process 25,175 people/day—the most important metric is how many tests we can process. And we are clearly failing that metric. (At the current rate, processing 989,000 people could take over 39 days (989,000/25,175)."The good news is that testing capacity numbers are ramping up, and the FDA is approving new types of tests that could speed up processing. Bad news is that would have been good news a month ago. By denying that a problem could exist for so long, it has cost us mightily in executing a timely and coordinated response. Now, we are seeing how far behind we are compared to countries like South Korea who have been ramping up testing and processing at pace with the outbreak."It is imperative that we must:

1. Ramp up even faster testing and expand lab capacity and proactively test people showing any signs in any medical settings as well as health personnel;
2. Consider more accessible testing methods like drive-thru testing;
3. And have Dr. Fauci be the only official spokesperson to ever talk about this outbreak—period.
4. Please re-read Point 3."We thank the administration for sharing these initial numbers they have compiled, and we hope they continue to track and share these numbers consistently. It is their responsibility to do so."==

The base is only a few miles from a town in Afghanistan with 5 known positive cases for coronavirus."We asked the Department of Defense whether the Army has coronavirus testing kits physically at all bases abroad. After following up, they are still unable to tell us yes or no answer—does every military base overseas have current access to coronavirus kits?"The fact that we cannot figure out this basic answer for our troops serving abroad is very concerning.

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after the Trump administration repeatedly was unable to answer questions about our country's coronavirus testing capacity."At yesterday's hearing with FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn as well as this morning's briefing with members of the Trump administration, Commissioner Hahn was unable to confidently tell me what our capacity is to process the coronavirus testing kits we are now increasingly distributing."Commissioner Hahn has noted that 2.5 million coronavirus tests are available, and since multiple tests are needed per person, he explained that these are only enough to test 989,000 people."However, after a person is tested, the test needs to also be processed by labs in the United States. Former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, has explained that labs in the United States currently only have the capacity to process about 17,000 patients a day. That means that with the current supply of test kits for 989,000 people, it would take over 58 days to process just these tests. New info from the CDC indicates they may be able to double their processing capacity soon, however that still means it could potentially take almost a month to process tests. That is a huge problem."The administration must stop misinforming the public on their capacity to test patients in the United States. We demand the administration provide us with the full capacity numbers for labs in the United States as well."==

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement in response to the Trump administration's launch of their Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs initiative."President Trump's latest apprenticeship plan is just the most recent reminder that this Department of Labor has never prioritized working people. Instead of investing in the Registered Apprenticeship program--a proven and effective federal workforce training program built in strong partnership with trade unions nationwide—President Trump has chosen to pursue an untested and unauthorized industry—run plan that does not protect the welfare of apprentices."Trump's ‘Industry Recognized Apprenticeships' (IRAPs) avoid accountability by leaving some oversight to third-party entities, undermining the assurance of quality and protection that the Registered Apprenticeship model ensures. I also have serious concerns with the political influence of non-union construction contractors in the rulemaking process."President Trump and the Department of Labor should abandon this plan, and instead work with Congress to expand Registered Apprenticeships to provide high-quality, proven workforce training programs for workers and employers nationwide."==
Title: Pocan, Gillibrand Announce Bill to End Rampant Outsourcing And Protect American Jobs
Date: March 6, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) announced bicameral legislation, the End Outsourcing Act, which would utilize the tax code and federal grants, loans and contracts to end the outsourcing of jobs overseas.

The bill would prevent employers from deducting expenses related to outsourcing, deny certain tax breaks to outsourcing employers, and require federal agencies awarding contracts, loans, loan guarantees, and grants to establish a negative preference for employers who have outsourced in the last three years.

It also further disincentivizes sending jobs overseas by taxing foreign profits at the same rate as domestic profits. The bill also prevents outsourcing companies from bidding on federal contracts or grants without disclosing their outsourcing practices."It's time to stop helping companies that ship jobs overseas, and reward those bringing jobs back home," saidSenator Gillibrand."For far too long, companies have been allowed to use tax incentives to move facilities overseas for cheap labor, leaving hundreds of New Yorkers — and millions of Americans — struggling without jobs. I'm proud that my End Outsourcing Act would eliminate tax benefits for outsourcers and impose significant penalties on companies that outsource, while also providing incentives for companies that invest in the United States. No one should fear losing their job because their company doesn't want to invest in American labor. This legislation will be a key step to bringing jobs back to the United States and employing workers across New York State.""For too long, we have allowed federal contracts, loans, grants and the tax code to reward companies that prioritize their own profit over the livelihoods of American workers," saidRep. Pocan."Congress must incentivize companies to invest in American jobs, workers, and communities. In the first two years of the Trump administration, almost 200,000 jobs were outsourced and federal contractors that offshored jobs received almost $51 billion in contracts. This administration is bleeding the middle class dry while showering tax breaks on corporations that outsource strong family-supporting jobs – we must take action to stop it. The End Outsourcing Act is a necessary first step to bring jobs back to our country and put American workers first."

Too many businesses in the United States have sent domestic manufacturing jobs overseas to low-cost, low-wage countries as companies aim to cut costs and increase profit. Meanwhile, families and communities in states across the country are feeling the loss. Between 2001 and 2015, the United States lost more than three million jobs to China alone--nearly three quarters in manufacturing. The End Outsourcing Act is designed to reverse this trend and ensure that federal contracts, loans, and grants funded by taxpayers support companies that employ American workers.

The End Outsourcing Act is cosponsored in the Senate by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Gary Peters and will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI-02). The legislation has also received the endorsement of several labor unions, including: the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, United Steelworkers, Communications Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the American Federation of Labor.==
Title: Pocan Introduces Food Worker Pay Standards Act

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.–U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), today introduced the Food Worker Pay Standards Act which would ensure that the federal government only purchases food produced by workers who earn fair pay and benefits.

The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor to use local wages and benefits for food production workers in conjunction with local collective bargaining agreements to establish a regional prevailing wage and would prevent the federal government from purchasing food produced by workers paid less than those prevailing rates. This standard would apply to meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, and processed food workers."The federal government should not be in the business of rewarding companies with taxpayer-funded contracts if they don't pay or protect their workers adequately," saidRep. Mark Pocan. "Workers in the food processing industry are disproportionately workers of color, and the time is long overdue to protect their dangerous jobs with federal guardrails. This bill will signal to food processing companies nationwide that the federal government is only willing to work with businesses that put workers first. Anything less will not be funded by the American people.""The Food Worker Pay Standards Act is a strong investment in American workers in our country's meatpacking and food processing industries," saidMarc Perrone, International President of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)."By setting high standards for companies that receive billions of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts, Congress is sending a powerful message that these jobs need to be good jobs that put food safety and workers first. As the largest union representing America's food workers, UFCW is proud to support this legislation. We urge Congress to stand up for good jobs in this industry by passing this bill and sending it to the president's desk for his signature."

Food production and processing workers face dangerous conditions and federal contracting should not undermined the high standards that workers have secured through bargaining with their employers. Ice cream producers suffer injury and illness at more thantwice the rateof other workers and pork slaughterhouses have a turnover rate ofnearly 100%annually. Federal contracts should improve - not undermine – wages and benefits for workers.

The legislation is endorsed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW); AFL-CIO; Bakery, Confectionery, and Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers (BCTGM).

This legislation is co-sponsored by Anthony Brown (D-MD), André Carson (D-IN), Danny Davis (D-IL), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Marcia Fudge (D-OH), Jesus "Chuy" García (D-IL), Deb Haaland (D-NM), Jahana Hayes (D-CT), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Robin Kelly (D-IL), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Dan Kildee (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Andy Levin (D-MI), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Linda Sánchez (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Paul Tonko (D-NY), Norma Torres (D-CA), Lori Trahan (D-MA), David Trone (D-MD), Maxine Waters (D-CA).==

Dr. Robert R. Redfield, M.D.

Director

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

1600 Clifton Road

Atlanta, GA 30329-4027

Dear Director Redfield:

I am concerned by your decision to stop publicly reporting the number of Americans tested for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on your agency's website.

Until last night, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported publicly on its website the number of travel-related COVID-19 cases in the United States, the number of person-to-person spread COVID-19 cases, the total number of persons tested for COVID-19, and the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19.[1]Inexplicably, today, the CDC's public webpage dedicated to COVID-19 data no longer displays how many persons have been tested for, or who have died from, COVID-19. I would like to know why.

Americans are dying. We deserve to know how many Americans have perished from COVID-19, and we deserve to know how many people have been tested for it. According to former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, "Right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases…that aren't reported yet."[2]Knowing that CDC testing is keeping pace with the likely number of cases is imperative to maintaining public trust. With that in mind, when will you return to publicly reporting the total number of deaths and tested persons on your website?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.==
Title: Pocan Fights for Air Wisconsin Flight Attendants’ Wages

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
U.S. RepresentativeMark Pocan (WI-02)led a letter on behalf of Air Wisconsin flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA), urging the National Mediation Board (NMB) to give fair consideration to AFA-CWA's request to advance the contract negotiation process.

The Air Wisconsin flight attendants' wages have been frozen since 2007, and after negotiating contracts for almost four years, and over two years in mediation, the flight attendants voted to authorize a strike in November of 2018. However, due to restrictions in the Railway Labor Act, the NMB is the only body that can intervene and progress negotiations to allow for arbitration or subsequently a strike. Despite repeated requests from the AFA, the NMB has failed to take action."Air Wisconsin flight attendants are trapped in poverty wages as their voices are ignored by executives at Air Wisconsin and United Airlines," saidRep. Mark Pocan. "Four years of contract negotiations and over a decade of stagnant wages is not good faith bargaining, it's not even good management. When workers organize and vote to strike, they deserve to exercise that right. The National Mediation Board must take action to allow these negotiations to progress. Anything less is inadequate and does not do justice to the hard work of flight attendants that keeps airline passengers safe each and every day.""There is no excuse for the pace or length of negotiations with Air Wisconsin," saidSara Nelson, AFA International President. "While contracts do not expire under the Railway Labor Act, the statute has clear parameters to move to a strike deadline when the parties are no longer moving toward an agreement. It has been two years since this management made any movement in negotiations, even with the assistance of federal mediators. Flight Attendants meanwhile are earning poverty wages and often can't afford a place to live. The National Mediation Board needs to move forward as the law intended to bring negotiations to a close. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA thanks Representative Pocan and all of the co-signers for calling on the agency to follow the law and bring these negotiations to a close."

The letter was also signed by Linda T. Sánchez (D-CA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Susan Wild (D-PA), Norma Torres (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Jared Huffman (D-CA), Andy Levin (D-MI), Angie Craig (D-MN), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Mark Desaulnier (D-CA), Deb Haaland (D-NM), Peter A.

U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Debbie Dingell (MI-12)today sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging the administration to immediately restore all U.S. funding for humanitarian aid in Gaza, including United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) funding. The letter also urges an end to the blockade on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza."Palestinians in Gaza are facing a humanitarian crisis and unless the United States acts now, we will be complacent in the starvation and poverty of millions of people," saidRep. Pocan."Eighty percent of the population in Gaza depends on international assistance to survive, and without our support that means an overwhelming amount of families are living in poverty and a majority of Palestinians in Gaza have undrinkable water, food shortages, and inadequate healthcare. Restoring U.S. assistance to Gaza as well as urging the Israeli government to end the blockade is a necessary step to secure a peaceful and stable future for the region.""The humanitarian situation in Gaza is untenable. Cutting US aid to Palestinians puts stress on the already stretched thin UN and non-profit humanitarian organizations struggling to provide access to water, food, employment, and healthcare," saidRep. Dingell. "Further, cutting aid raises tensions and will make it more difficult to address the root causes of the conflict. The Administration must work with our international partners to restore humanitarian aid in Gaza, and reiterate our commitment toward a just, two-state solution."

The letter was endorsed by numerous international groups, including J Street, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), OXFAM, Churches for Middle East Peace (CMEP), Friends Service Committee for Legislation (FCNL), Global Ministries of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), United Church of Christ, Amnesty International, Win Without War, the Reformed Church of America, and Christian Reformed Church Office of Social Justice.

Title: Pocan Condemns Pompeo Deportation of Hmong People

U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)today sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging the Secretary to immediately cease efforts to deport Hmong people living in the United States. The letter was co-signed withRep. Gwen Moore (WI-04)andSenator Tammy Baldwin."As members of Congress for the state of Wisconsin, we will not stand for this Administration's blatant racism against the 49,000 members of the Hmong community living across our state," said Rep. Pocan. "I refuse to let our friends and neighbors be deported to a country that too many of them fled as refugees. We will not allow this administration to unilaterally deport an ethnic community whenever they see fit. Wisconsin is their home and it will remain their home.""Trump has launched an agenda rooted in fear, xenophobia, and paranoia against immigrant families," saidRep. Gwen Moore. "This Administration's decision to deport thousands of Hmong people hits Milwaukee particularly hard. The Milwaukee area has the fourth largest population of Hmong people in the country, many of whom were admitted as refugees after the end of the Vietnam War. In the mid-1970's, many families fled persecution, hardship and oppression in Laos and started a new life in Wisconsin. Deportation would not only be dangerous for them, but also isolating for those who have known no other home than this country."

Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement ahead of the vote on the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act."In Wisconsin, we've seen the firsthand effects of the attacks on labor, as former Governor Scott Walker gutted labor protections and turned my home state into a ‘right-to-work' state. The PRO Act would eliminate those state right-to-work-for-less laws and ensure that unions can receive the full support of the workers it represents."For far too long, workers have been stripped of their voices, losing their power to organize for better wages and benefits. With the PRO Act, we fight back against corporations and anti-union special interests that have attacked and eroded the labor movement for decades.Building a fair economy for anyone requires strong labor rights for everyone."The PRO Act ensures every worker's right to unionize is protected by creating enforceable penalties for companies that break the law, expanding collective bargaining rights, and securing access to fair union elections that corporations must respect."With stronger unions, workers can secure higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions. It's time to give workers the tools they need to survive in an economy rigged against them. Every worker deserves to have a union. Every worker deserves the PRO Act."==

Make no mistake, Donald Trump committed two impeachable offenses—abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress—and acquitting him of those crimes is a refusal to uphold one's oath of office."At every step of this impeachment trial, Republican Senators have acted as the President's personal bodyguards. By refusing to allow any witnesses or documents, they're engaging in a cover-up. Pronouncing his innocence before the trial even began, these Senators did not even attempt to act as impartial jurors. They suspended their oaths to the Constitution in favor of protecting a tyrant, long ago."If we can't trust the Senate to hold this President accountable, then they must at least uphold their basic duty and pass legislation to protect our democracy from further foreign interference. Our democracy is now too vulnerable to afford another election unprotected."==
Title: Pocan Announces Kathy Honerbaum as State of the Union Guest
Date: February 3, 2020
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today announced Kathy Honerbaum, a retired nurse of over 50 years in Dodgeville, as his guest for the State of the Union. Honerbaum, after recently being diagnosed with breast cancer, was prescribed Ibrance, a $13,000 per month drug, with a $2,800 copay with Medicare Part D. If H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, were passed, Ibrance would be included in the list of drugs to be negotiated because it is the seventeenth-most costly drug to Medicare part D.

For months, Honerbaum could not afford Ibrance, despite repeated attempts to request financial support from the drug's manufacturer, Pfizer. Honerbaum finally cut back on her working hours and entered an early retirement, so that she could meet the low-income threshold Pfizer has set for drug waivers. Finally, the pharmaceutical company covered the cost of her drug, but months later she found out the drug was not working. Luckily, her new drug, Xeloda, has no co-pay. Everyone isn't so ‘lucky.'"Big Pharma's tight grip on life-saving drugs for millions of Americans has gone unchecked for far too long. When people across the country know the name of the drug that could save their lives, but cannot afford it without taking out another mortgage on their home or going into bankruptcy—that's a problem,"said Rep. Pocan. "Kathy's story is a heartbreaking one that is all too familiar for the millions of people in this country who have to upend their entire lives to afford their medications. If the Lower Drugs Cost Act Now Act was law, Kathy would not have had to go into an early retirement to afford her cancer drug—it would have been affordable. Kathy's story is a story that must be told to every Senator and President Trump as they continue to drag their feet on lowering the cost of drugs, and that's why I am lucky to have her as my guest for the State of the Union.""No one should have to go through what I had to go through to afford medication that could help save a life,"said Kathy Honerbaum. "It is appalling that even basic medication like insulin costs families thousands of dollars. After pouring my heart out to Pfizer, I was lucky to have my drug covered, but luck should have nothing to do with our healthcare."

The Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which passed in the House in December, is sweeping legislation that would dramatically reduce drug prices by giving Medicare the power to negotiate directly with drug companies, ensuring lower drug prices for Americans. The bill would give the Department of Health and Human Services the power to negotiate on 50 of the highest cost and highest utilized drugs, including Ibrance.###==

We have no trust in an administration that has provided zero evidence of an imminent threat to America, destroyed all diplomatic channels with Iran, and deployed over 15,000 additional troops to the Middle East since last May. The American people do not want an endless war with Iran, they want diplomacy and de-escalation."Now, Congress must also move forward in passing Rep. Barbara Lee's legislation to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Iraq and Rep. Ro Khanna's legislation prohibiting funding for a war with Iran.

Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement following the House of Representatives vote on the implementing bill for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."Today, I voted against the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Though this new deal is a definitive improvement from NAFTA, I cannot be confident that this trade deal would correct its core flaws that led to the outsourcing of hundreds of thousands of American jobs, as well as serious environmental concerns."This was not an easy vote. The original USMCA proposed by President Trump was an unacceptable handout to pharmaceutical companies as well as failing to protect workers or our planet. Democrats, unions, and progressive advocates stood up to the President, and made this new deal better—including improving labor standards, removing the big, sloppy kiss to Big Pharma and strengthening enforcement mechanisms."Unfortunately, I cannot be confident that this trade deal would heal the wounds inflicted by NAFTA including, rampant outsourcing of American jobs, the closing of factories and manufacturing facilities across the country, and decades of harm to working and middle-class communities. The deal also fails to take a once in a generation opportunity for North America to take bold, collective action to address the climate crisis that threatens the future of our entire planet."Assuredly, this trade deal will provide some certainty to Wisconsin farmers and dairy producers, struggling in our current economy. However, this is not a wholesale solution to the issues of dairy or other segments of agriculture in the Midwest. I call on the administration to cease their chaotic tactics and trade war by tweet that have put family farmers in harms way and contributed to the closing of over 1900 dairy farms since the start of Donald Trump's presidency."Our goal should be a trade deal that is a model for future deals—not merely a marginal improvement to existing law, with questions about its ultimate effectiveness."==
Title: Pocan: ‘A Vote That Sets the Precedent for All Future Presidents’
Date: December 19, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following videoafter the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump. See the full text of his video below.

On January 3rd, 2013, I was sworn into Congress. On that day, I swore an oath—an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all its enemies. Unfortunately, President Trump has made it clear: he doesn't support our Constitution.

In July of 2019, President Trump blocked $400 million in Congressionally-approved aid that Ukraine desperately needed to defend itself against Russia. But he needed Ukraine to do him a favor first though. President Trump asked that the President of Ukraine launch an investigation into his political rival, Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, military aid and a meeting with the president would only come after.

But this is not about a single call or a single transcript. This is about a perfect storm—months of activity directly ordered by the President to his senior Cabinet and political appointees. Months of activity led by this President to pressure the Ukrainian government to conduct investigations into his political rivals.

There is no question about it—this was a clear and orchestrated plan laid out by this President, inviting a foreign power to interfere in our democracy.

President Trump betrayed his oath of office. He abused the power of his office—the highest office in the land—for personal and political gain. Since then, he has refused to cooperate with a co-equal branch of the federal government—the United States Congress—by refusing to provide any documents or allowing any government witnesses to testify. This obstruction of Congress coupled with his shameless abuse of power make up the articles of impeachment the House of Representatives passed today.

Our vote to impeach the president should not have been a partisan vote. It was a vote for our Constitution and a vote for the future of our country. It was a vote that sets the precedent for all future presidents—Democrat or Republican.

In his long life, Donald J. Trump has never been held accountable for his actions. Today, Democrats sent a clear signal to this president and all future presidents: No one is above the law.==

Also, this is the first time we have necessarily expressed that a viable two-state solution must include explicit support for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent pledge to annex the West Bank eliminates any possibility of a future Palestinian state and the reality of long-lasting peace in the region.

Once again, the Trump administration is taking a massive step backwards and endangering any hopes of peace in the region with this destructive action. Reversing on decades-long bipartisan U.S. policy opposing the settlements in the West Bank is a blatant attempt to help Prime Minister Netanyahu—not promote peace in the region."With every policy they announce, this administration has made it clear: they don't want peace, they want instability. This announcement is one in a series of destabilizing decisions made by this administration—from cutting Congressionally-approved humanitarian funding to Gaza and the West Bank to moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem—these actions don't bring us any closer to peace. We need to pass House Resolution 326 and reaffirm our opposition to settlement expansion, support for a two-state solution, and opposition to the annexation of the West Bank."==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bill to Protect Grad Students Right to Unionize
Date: November 14, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), today introduced the Respect Graduate Student Workers Act, which prohibits the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from enacting their proposed rule which would strip graduate student workers' right to unionize,Jurisdiction-Nonemployee Status of University and College Students Working in Connection With Their Studies.

The new bill seeks to ensure the full labor protections for graduate student workers—no matter the educational relationship between graduate student workers and a college or university. The Trump-appointed NLRB has sought to prevent graduate workers at private colleges and universities from unionizing, with a rule that attempts to define them as students only. These graduate employees teach coursework, conduct research, assist professors, and perform other revenue-generating work in conjunction with their studies. They deserve the right to form a union and collectively bargain, just as every worker in every industry deserves."This administration's most recent attempt to erode the rights of workers comes in the shape of an attack on graduate student workers who balance education with work for their schools,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Graduate workers are a vital part of teaching and research in colleges and universities and should have an equal voice in that workplace. Stripping them of their rights to unionize is a blatant attempt to profit off the backs of graduate students without giving them their due. It's time we give all workers the right to fight for a living wage.""As a graduate worker who struggles to make ends meet, I am very grateful Rep. Pocan is standing with us in our fight for change,said Tom Hansberger, a Marquette University graduate student worker. "All working people should have the right to join together and have a voice in their union."

Like many things in the labor movement, graduate student unions have their historical home in Wisconsin. The Teaching Assistant's Association is the oldest graduate employee union in the country, turning 50 years old this year. That movement has grown to over 60 recognized graduate student unions across the country. These unions have given graduate student workers the power to collectively bargain, improving their pay and benefits—including a lower reliance on student loans, better workplace protections and broader health insurance.

Graduate students who are working while enrolled in school deserve a living wage. The NLRB's new rule is just this administration's most recent attempt to dismantle the labor movement and gut worker power in the workplace. Graduate student workers are no different than employees anywhere else—and we cannot silence their voices in the workplace.

The bill is endorsed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Both unions represent graduate student workers on campuses across the country.==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bill to Strengthen Apprenticeships for New Wave of Working People
Date: October 31, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), today introduced the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act. The LEARNS Act would increase the number of skilled workers in the United States and strengthen registered apprenticeship programs as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers."The LEARNS Act is an investment in the economic power of millions of people across the country—ensuring everyone has the tools and resources they need to secure living wages and quality jobs," saidRepresentative Mark Pocan. "By strengthening registered apprenticeship programs and preparing workers for permanent employment, we can create a definitive link between training programs and employment, while offering employers access to the skilled workforce they need. Wisconsin was the first state to establish a law creating an apprenticeship program, and we've seen the successes of that initiative for over 100 years. It's time we build on that achievement and give more workers and employers nationwide the same resources and opportunities."

Over the next decade, 45% of all jobs will be classifiable as "middle-skill" occupations—positions which require more than a high school diploma, but don't necessitate a bachelor's degree. Registered apprenticeship programs hold the key to preparing a new wave of working people for these jobs and ensuring all people have the adequate resources for economic stability. The registered apprenticeship program model has proven success in skilled trades and service industries for both workers and employers, with every dollar invested in a craft apprenticeship yielding up to $3 in return for employers."The men and women of the IUPAT thank and personally commend, Rep. Pocan for his ongoing fight for working families, and for his leadership in introducing the LEARNS Act,"Kenneth Rigmaiden, General President, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. "With well over 100 years' experience in building our great nation, the skilled crafts men and women of the Building Trades know that an apprenticeship is the gateway to a safe and successful career, that creates more than upward mobility it addresses the growing need for skilled labor in our nation's expanding markets. The passage of the LEARNS Act will ensure that the American workforce will learn the necessary and portable skills to meet the specific demands of employers and entire industries through qualified apprenticeship programs.""Apprenticeships are essential to expanding economic opportunity for millions of American workers,"said Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. "The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to keep up with the rising costs of healthcare, child care, housing, and education. The LEARNS Act takes this problem head on by investing to ensure more workers can get the skills and tools they need to succeed. I am proud to join Congressman Pocan in this effort on behalf of working families and the middle class."

The LEARNS Act will:

• Creates national standards for registered apprenticeship programs.
• Increases the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by program participants.
• Supports a closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, employers, educational institutions, and other program sponsors offering good jobs.
• Establishes a permanent advisory council at the Department of Labor, bringing employers, labor unions, and state apprenticeship agencies together to oversee the actions and implementation of registered apprenticeship programs.

Original cosponsors on this legislation include Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Albio Sires (D-NJ), André Carson (D-IN), Andy Levin (D-MI), Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), Brian Higgins (D-NY), Cindy Axne (D-IO), Conor Lamb (D-PA), Dan Kildee (D-MI), Darren Soto (D-FL), David Scott (D-GA), Deb Haaland (D-NM), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Dwight Evans (D-PA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Gil Cisneros (D-CA), Gregorio Killi Camacho Sablan (D-MP), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Jason Crow (D-CO), Jim Langevin (D-RI), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Joe Courtney (D-CT), Joe Morelle (D-NY), José E.

Title: Pocan Submits Public Comment on F-35 Mission at Truax Air National Guard Base

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today submitted the following public comment on the United States Air Force's Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed F-35 mission at Truax Air National Guard Base, alsoavailable to view here."Dear Secretary Barrett:

I write to submit my formal public comment on the United States Air Force's Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed F-35 mission at Truax Air National Guard Base. I previously expressed concerns to your predecessor about the brevity of the originally-noticed public comment period, the inability of an average person to understand the technical descriptions of anticipated noise levels, the potential for nearby homes to become incompatible for residential use, and the lack of noise mitigation assistance for impacted constituents.

I thank you for discussing these concerns with me and for extending the public comment period. Unfortunately, however, as a Member of Congress who has never supported the authorization of funding for the development of the F-35, and who remains deeply disturbed by program cost overruns and other issues, questions and concerns about the proposal remain.

Respectfully, I continue to request a flight demonstration of an F-35 and F-16 at Truax so that differences in noise levels between the two aircraft can be directly observed. I recently learned that multiple F-35 arrivals and departures have occurred in Madison over the past several months, and that the Air Force neglected to alert elected officials or community members who would have benefitted from hearing the differences between the two planes while taking-off and landing. Considering that the Air Force has already brought F-35A planes to Dane County Airport, it should not be difficult to accommodate my request for a comparison test flight of the two planes. I believe it is imperative that there is an F-35 and F-16 take-off and landing comparison at Truax before any final decision is made due to the general public's inability to understand the draft EIS's description of possible noise level increases and their impacts.

Additionally, I continue to be concerned that the Air Force has not committed to financially supporting noise mitigation efforts for households, schools and other community buildings impacted by the F-35, including those according to the EIS who will be "incompatible for residential use" due to the proposed F-35 beddown in Madison.

Although the Air Force has listed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 150 noise compatibility program as one solution, according to an analysis by the City of Madison, that program is not available for more than 500 homes near the airport, including 312 mobile homes, 195 income restricted apartments and 36 townhomes owned by the Community Development Authority.

Therefore, I believe the Air Force must commit publicly to securing funding for anyone impacted by the placement of the F-35 in Madison.

Without commitments for noise mitigation assistance from the Air Force, it will be difficult to support any potential F-35 mission at Truax Air National Guard Base. I believe this must be addressed to ensure any negative outcomes caused by the F-35 coming to Madison are adequately addressed.

Thank you for your attention to these requests. I look forward to continuing to engage with you on behalf of the people of Wisconsin's Second Congressional District.

Sincerely,Mark PocanMember of Congress"

Homestead has made that especially clear. After appallingly detaining children and failing to provide them with even the minimum adequate support and services, this administration continued to fund an empty shelter for $720,000 a month—lining the pockets of private companies—and footing the bill to the American taxpayer. The Homestead detention center is another reckless and racist endeavor carried out by this administration with little foresight and no strategy—and the time is long overdue that we close it and other mass immigrant detention centers for good."==

U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement in response toanswers from Jonathan Hayes, Director of DHHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement, indicating that despite the Homestead detention center no longer detaining children, they continue to pay for the cost of keeping the center open."Today, after questioning the Trump administration, I learned that the cost to keep the vacant for-profit Homestead detention center in Florida is almost $600 a bed--$600 that is directly lining the pockets of Caliburn, the private company that runs the facility," said Congressman Pocan. "My consistuents are wondering why it costs $600 for an empty bed and over $750 to detain a child in deplorable conditions when they could pay the same to stay the night in the Four Seasons or a Trump Hotel. President Trump's disastrous and disgusting family separation policies have resulted in nothing but a blatant disregard for human life and a failure to support migrants families who are seeking refuge in this country."Rep. Pocan understands we need to ensure capacity to care for unaccompanied children who come into this country, but the American people continue to be faced with numerous unanswered questions.

• Why is the government bankrolling a shuttered facility on behalf of a for-profit company?
• How many other empty facilities is this Administration funding in anticipation of detaining more unaccompanied children, what about Fort Still and Carrizo Springs?
• If it costs $750 to detain a child, why are we paying $600—almost 80% of the cost of caring for a child—to a private facility running an empty detention center?###==

Specifically, the Air Force should conduct a take-off and landing of the F-16 and the F-35 planes so community members will have a more accurate understanding of the noise impact from the F-35 mission."

Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Tom Cole (OK-04), and Tom Suozzi (NY-03) led a bipartisan group of representatives to pass the "Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act," which would reauthorize Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) for 5 years.

HKNC provides essential vocational training and rehabilitation to the deaf-blind community across the United States. The Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act allows for continued funding of the Center through 2023. The HKNC Act passed unanimously by a voice vote and now heads to the Senate."The Helen Keller National Center has a long history of supporting deaf-blind people nationwide, providing them with opportunities to take an active role in our local communities,"said Pocan. "For over 50 years, the Center has been an invaluable resource and solid foundation for deaf-blind Americans across the nation and in my home state of Wisconsin. I'm proud to join my colleagues and lead this effort to reauthorize the Center for five more years so this beneficial work can continue to shape the lives of so many.""Following its passage in the House, I am very pleased that legislation to reauthorize the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults is now one step closer to the finish line. For more than 50 years, the Center has admirably served deaf-blind communities and also supported those who care for and work with these individuals,"said Cole. "Certainly, the Center's valuable mission, important work and role as a resource is worth affirming through reauthorization by Congress.""The Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, which is located in my district, is unique in that it is the only organization of its kind nationwide that serves a population that is both deaf and blind. HKNC enables deaf-blind Americans to live, work, and thrive in our community,"said Suozzi. "It is my privilege to support this reauthorization and do what I can to support and strengthen this organization, one that truly represents miracles in people's lives.""On behalf of Helen Keller National Center I would like to express a special thanks Representative Pocan for championing the re-authorization of the HKNC Act,"said Susan Ruzenski, Executive Director of Helen Keller National Center. "By doing so he has made visible to Congress a community that strives to realize their aspirations and has demonstrated time and time again that given access to quality services and opportunities they too can achieve self-actualized lives."

Since it was first authorized by Congress in 1967, HKNC has expanded to support regional representatives based in California, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Washington. It has additionally created six new deaf-blind specialist positions across the country that will provide additional assistance and support to deaf-blind persons in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. HKNC's goal is to deploy 20 deaf-blind specialists (2 in each region) and to establish a Community Service program in Los Angeles/San Diego with the goal of 4 additional community programs by 2020.

HKNC is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referral, support, and training exclusively to youths and adults who have combined vision and hearing loss. The Center also supports the families and professionals who work with the deaf-blind community.==

WASHINGTON, DC (July 25, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)today led 27 of their House colleagues to introduce aHouse Resolutionhonoring the 71stAnniversary of Human Rights Day and the 1948 ratification by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)."In the past 71 years, we've seen significant improvements in the protection of human rights, equality, and justice around the globe, however, it is clear there is still significant work to do. The rights of women, LGBTQ individuals, and minority communities are still under threat around the world,"Pocan said."This resolution reiterates the U.S. commitment to pursuing consistent and principled human rights policies when engaging with all foreign countries. The importance of this resolution is not lost as the Trump Administration forms a Commission on Unalienable Rights in an attempt to make an end run around human rights experts and established State Department structures.""Seventy-one years ago, our nation signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),"Lowenthal said."Today, more than ever, it is critical that the promotion of respect for human rights as embodied in the declaration remain a key component of our country's foreign policy. Our nation was founded on the basic principles of life, freedom, and humanity that are enshrined in the UDHR. Congress, the Trump Administration and the world, must recognize that those who are denied basic human rights, such as the freedoms of speech, religion, and political expression, are also denied basic human respect and dignity. We must continue to advocate and fight for the universal protection of human rights."

Championed by First Lady and U.N Ambassador Eleanor Roosevelt, and adopted by the United Nations in 1948, the UDHR represents the first comprehensive international agreement about the specific rights and freedoms of all human beings. Today, the UDHR is the world's most translated document, with over 416 different translations.

Since 1948, the UDHR has been the foundational document for enumerable international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and is a key component of the International Bill of Human Rights which went into effect in 1976.

Pocan and Lowenthal's legislation currently has the support of 27 other House Members.

Title: Pocan Leads Members of Congress in Unveiling Bold Legislation to Fundamentally Reform the Private Equity Industry
Date: July 18, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (July 18, 2019)– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), joinedU.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH)to unveil the Stop Wall Street Looting Act. The comprehensive bill fundamentally reforms the private equity industry and levels the playing field by forcing private equity firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over, empowering workers, and protecting investors."With the help of our rigged tax code, private equity firms have made out like bandits at the expense of workers and communities. Private investment funds should not be able to cash out by gambling with the wellbeing of hard-working families,"said Pocan. "When the private equity firm Sun Capital bought Shopko – a retail chain that's been in business for over 50 years – they loaded it up with debt, sending it into bankruptcy and leaving their workers with no severance and few options. After many employees spent years – some decades – working for Shopko, they were abruptly left out in the cold with nowhere to turn. This critical piece of legislation holds predatory private equity firms accountable and protects workers from the consequences of firms' greed.""This bold legislation stands firm against Wall Street and private equity firms by protecting workers from abusive practices that eliminate jobs and topple markets,"said Jayapal."My colleagues and I are taking the powerful steps this issue deserves – we are listening to the families, workers and small businesses that deserve fair treatment.""For far too long, Washington has looked the other way while private equity firms take over companies, load them with debt, strip them of their wealth, and walk away scot-free – leaving workers, consumers, and whole communities to pick up the pieces,"said Warren."Our bill ends these abusive practices by putting private investment funds on the hook for the decisions made by the companies they control, ending looting, empowering workers and investors, and safeguarding the markets from risky corporate debt.""An out of state, predatory private equity firm shut down stores across Wisconsin and nearly 3,000 ShopKo workers lost their job. We need to rip up the predatory playbook that private equity firms are using to leave workers with nothing but pink slips,"said Baldwin."Our legislation takes on Wall Street abuse and closes loopholes that private equity firms are using to make a quick buck while they shut down businesses and lay off workers. This bold reform will help rewrite the rules of our economy and protect workers from predatory practices so that we can start rewarding hard work and not just wealth.""Workers' jobs, benefits, and pensions have been wiped out by private equity executives looking to make a quick buck,"said Brown. "The Stop Wall Street Looting Act will protect hardworking Ohio families by ending the risky bets that cripple Main Street companies for the benefit of Wall Street."

Over the last two decades, private equity activity in the economy has exploded. Since 2009, investors have allocated$5.8 trillionglobally to private equity. These funds have purchased companies in all sectors of the economy – fromnursing homes, tonewspapers, togrocery stores– laying off hundreds of thousands of workers and ruining thousands of companies in the process. Today, 35,000 companies owned by private equity employ nearly5.8 million workers.

The private equity industryclaimsthat it earns high returns for investors by leveraging their capital to buy companies, using funds' management expertise to make the companies' operations more efficient, and then selling the companies at a profit. In reality, private equity funds often load up companies with debt, strip them of their assets, and extract exorbitant fees, while guaranteeing payouts for themselves and walking away from workers, communities, and investors if the bets go bad.

TheStop Wall Street Looting Actwould fundamentally reform private equity by closing the legal, tax, and regulatory loopholes that allow private equity firms to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk. Firms that take appropriate steps in the interest of the company, the fund, and workers, will continue to make investments. The bill would:

• Require Private Investment Funds to Have Skin in the Game.Firms will share responsibility for the liabilities of companies under their control including debt, legal judgments and pension-related obligations to better align the incentives of private equity firms and the companies they own. In order to encourage more responsible use of debt, the bill ends the tax subsidy for excessive leverage, and closes the carried interest loophole.
• End Looting of Portfolio Companies.To give portfolio companies a shot at success, the proposal bans dividends to investors for two years after a firm is acquired and ends the extraction of wealth from acquired companies through excessive fees.
• Protect Workers, Customers, and Communities.This proposal prevents private equity firms from walking away when a company fails and protects stakeholders by:Prioritizing worker pay in the bankruptcy process, and improving rules so workers are more likely to receive severance, pensions, and other payments they earned.Creating incentives for job retention so that workers can benefit from a company's second chance.Ending the immunity of private equity firms from legal liability when their portfolio companies break the law, including the WARN Act. When workers at a plant are shortchanged or residents at a nursing home are hurt because private equity firms force portfolio companies to cut corners, the firm should be liable.Clarifying that gift cards are consumer deposits, ensuring their priority in bankruptcy.
• Prioritizing worker pay in the bankruptcy process, and improving rules so workers are more likely to receive severance, pensions, and other payments they earned.
• Creating incentives for job retention so that workers can benefit from a company's second chance.
• Ending the immunity of private equity firms from legal liability when their portfolio companies break the law, including the WARN Act. When workers at a plant are shortchanged or residents at a nursing home are hurt because private equity firms force portfolio companies to cut corners, the firm should be liable.
• Clarifying that gift cards are consumer deposits, ensuring their priority in bankruptcy.
• Empower Investors by Increasing Transparency.Private equity managers will be required to disclose fees, returns, and political expenditures so that investors can monitor their investments and shop around.
• Require Regulators to Address Risky Leverage.The Dodd-Frank provisions that require arrangers of corporate debt securitization to retain some of the risk will be reinstated.

Joining the lawmakers in introducing the legislation are U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee (CA-13), Jesús "Chuy" García (IL-04), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Rashida Tlaib (MI-13), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03).###==

WASHINGTON, DC (July 18, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today applauded the U.S. House of Representatives for passing H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. The legislation would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, raising wages for up to 33 million workers and lifting millions of Americans out of poverty. Pocan is one of the authors of the legislation andled his colleaguesin introducing the bill earlier this year."Today the House of Representatives fulfilled a promise we made to the American people – to pass legislation that would raise wages for millions of workers. American workers are among the most productive in the world, but in most industries, wages have stagnated, while the share going to profits and the top 1% has soared,"said Pocan."The Raise the Wage Act gives a well-deserved raise to nearly a quarter of the workforce and takes a step in the right direction to level the playing field. When workers have more money in their pockets, they have more money to spend to care for their families and stimulate our economy. Now that the House has acted, Senate Majority Leader McConnell should listen to American workers and bring this bill up for a vote."

The Raise the Wage Act will:

• Increase wages for up to 33 million American workers, including 829,000 workers in Wisconsin;
• Lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty, including 600,000 children, according to the CBO's review of a similar proposal; and
• Help secure fairness and equality for women, giving nearly 20 million working women a raise, and helping narrow the gender wage gap that disproportionately impacts women of color.###==
Title: Pocan Applauds House Passage of Amendment to Restore Honor to Service Members Discharged Due to Sexual Orientation

WASHINGTON, DC– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)applauded the House of Representatives for passing an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would correct the military records of service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. The amendment is based onlegislationPocan introduced last month, the Restore Honor to Service Members Act."This amendment will require the U.S. Department of Defense to correct the military records of service members discharged solely because of their sexual orientation. Importantly, amending service members' discharge characterizations to an honorable discharge will enable impacted individuals to access the benefits they earned and to which they would otherwise be entitled,"said Pocan."Today is a significant moment for the more than 100,000 Americans estimated to have been discharged from the military since World War II due to their sexual orientation. I'm grateful for my colleagues support of this critical amendment and I hope that the Senate will include similar language in its version of the bill and send it to the President's desk to become law."

Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of "other than honorable," "general discharge" or "dishonorable," depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.==

The legislation will correct the military records of service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned."We must correct the wrongs that the government committed when it dishonorably discharged veterans from the armed forces due to sexual orientation and ensure that these veterans receive the recognition and benefits they deserve,"said Pocan, Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus."The Restore Honor to Service Members Act streamlines this process – ensuring that the service and sacrifices of our veterans are respected and valued in the eyes of our country – and I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation forward.""There is no higher honor than service to our country – the stain of discriminatory practices have no business on the records of our brave LGBT service members,"said Hill.As the first LGBT woman to serve in Congress from the state of California and as the daughter and granddaughter of veterans, I know how critical it is to give the individuals who have worn our uniform the proper respect, regardless of their gender or sexual identity. This bill is long overdue, and I am proud to support this legislation alongside Congressman Pocan and our colleagues.""This bill is about confronting past discrimination. Hundreds of thousands of gay and lesbian veterans were unjustly discharged from the military, and then denied access to the benefits and honorable service records that are rightfully theirs. This bill is a chance for us to make it right,"saidSchatz."Veterans who honorably served our nation should not have to fight for their benefits,"said Gillibrand. "The Restore Honor to Service Members Act would clear discriminatory discharges they received on their records due solely to their sexual orientation. Our veterans deserve the recognition and benefits they earned for the sacrifices they made for our country, and I urge my colleagues to join me and pass this important bill."

Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of "other than honorable," "general discharge" or "dishonorable," depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.

Many veterans who were affected by discriminatory policies such as Don't Ask, Don't Tell do not know that they can have their records corrected or initiate a review. This legislation would require the Department of Defense to reach out to veterans who faced discrimination because of their sexual orientation about the Department's process for correcting their records.

The legislation is supported by American Veterans for Equal Rights, VoteVets.org, Modern Military Association of America, and the Human Rights Campaign. The bill has 100 cosponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives and more than two dozen cosponsors in the U.S. Senate.###==

WASHINGTON, DC (June 12, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and David B. McKinley, P.E. (WV-01)today reintroduced H.R. 3219, the U.S. Call Center and Consumer Protection Act, to deter American companies from sending call center and service jobs to foreign countries.U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA)reintroduced companion legislation in the Senate.

The bipartisan bill would deter companies from sending American jobs overseas and incentivize them to locate in the United States by creating a public list consisting of companies that sent call center work overseas. Being on the list would make these actors ineligible for federal grants or guaranteed loans. The bill would also require overseas call centers to disclose their locations to customers and would require them to comply with consumers' requests to be transferred to a service agent physically located in the United States."When corporations offshore American jobs, our communities and workers suffer the consequences, just so corporations can pay lower wages than what workers in the U.S. make,"said Pocan. "The U.S. Call Center Worker and Consumer Protection Act is smart policy – supported by both Republicans and Democrats – that will help keep call center jobs in the U.S. and help prevent the loss of economic activity in communities across the country. We must do more to support American workers and our economy, and we can start by ensuring that corporations that ship jobs overseas aren't rewarded with federal grants and loans.""Protecting and creating American jobs should be Congress' top priority,"said McKinley."Plain and simple, we should not be rewarding companies for moving jobs offshore. This bill does not mandate that companies keep call centers here in America, but simply says if you move call center jobs offshore, you don't receive funding from the government. This should be common sense."==

Given the recent reports of anti-union campaigns, Members believe it is imperative to protect employees' rights to organize and they are requesting information from Volkswagen on how the company is protecting the integrity of the upcoming vote to unionize."We previously wrote Volkswagen in July of 2016 to encourage you to respect your worker's rights to organize with the United Auto Workers (UAW), so we were heartened by your initial commitment to neutrality throughout this election process,"Members wrote."Unfortunately, in recent weeks the company invited Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, an outspoken opponent of unionization, to speak to its employees at a closed-door session; it sought counsel from the notorious union avoidance firm Littler Mendelson; and it recently established a website targeting employees with inflammatory articles about the UAW. These actions make us question Volkswagen's neutrality."

Specifically, Members are asking the following questions:

• How is Volkswagen keeping its commitment to neutrality?
• How is Volkswagen ensuring that its Chattanooga employees remain free of intentional or unintentional intimidation or threats from the company during the election process?
• How will Volkswagen ensure that workers' rights to take collective action free from intimidation or threats are respected after the election takes place, no matter the result?

As ramp workers and flight attendants decide whether to form a union with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), Delta has engaged in a series of dissuasion techniques, including hiring a consultant to manage an anti-union website and distributing offensive flyers in employee spaces."We understand your company has been exposing workers to a coordinated series of outrageous anti-union propaganda materials. This has included a website called ‘Don't Risk It. Don't Sign It,' which features misleading and deceptive claims about the role of a union and about the IAM specifically. We specifically take issue with the claim that ‘certifying a union would end our direct relationship and insert a middleman between delta people and leaders,'"Members wrote."We can only assume that this is a willful mischaracterization. When workers come together to form a union, they decide who their representatives will be and what their priorities for the workplace are. Referring to your own workers as ‘middlemen' is insulting to the contributions they make to your company and our country's aviation industry.""Union participation provides significant benefits to workers, workplaces, and our economy. Employees choosing to form a union is foundational to creating a fair economy and combatting income inequality, which has grown steadily in recent decades. Delta employees deserve the right to decide to form their own union and seek these benefits free from harassment or retaliation. Please put an end to this anti-union campaign and communicate to your workers that there will be no further fear or intimidation tactics used against them as they make this important decision for themselves,"concluded the Members.

While the Special Counsel's statement does not differ from what is in his report, it serves as an urgent reminder that Congress must uphold its constitutional duty to act as a co-equal branch of government and conduct oversight of the Executive Branch."The President's claim that ‘There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!" is incorrect and in direct contradiction to what Special Counsel Mueller said earlier today. As I saidlast week, we must start an impeachment inquiry to deliver the truth to the American people regarding Russia's interference in our elections and any attempts to obstruct justice in the investigation. Congress must now do its job."==
Title: Pocan Reintroduces Bill to Halt Large Ag Mergers Immediately, Indefinitely
Date: May 22, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (May 22, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today reintroduced a bill to place an immediate moratorium on large acquisitions and mergers in the food and agriculture sector. The moratorium would be in place until Congress passes comprehensive legislation addressing the problem of market concentration in the agricultural sector. The companion bill was introduced in the Senate byU.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jon Tester (D-MT). It is supported by more than 200 farm, food, rural, and consumer advocacy organizations.

The Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Actwas originally introduced by Pocan last Septemberand called for an 18-month moratorium on large mergers and acquisitions; this year's updated version calls for an indefinite halt. In addition to the indefinite moratorium, the bill would set up a commission to study how to strengthen antitrust oversight of the farm and food sectors and publish recommended improvements to merger enforcement and antitrust rules."Out-of-control consolidation has enabled big agricultural firms to control prices at every stage of the food chain, from farming to distribution, and Congress must do more to allow local farmers and food systems to be competitive, while establishing greater market transparency for the American consumer,"saidPocan."Today, corporate profits are soaring, but many middle-class families, farmers, and food workers continue to struggle. Establishing a moratorium on ag-mergers will not only strengthen our antitrust laws, but it will also expand economic security and opportunity to more of our communities.""Our agriculture and food sector have reached alarming levels of corporate concentration - today a small number of giant companies control every link of our food chain. For instance, four companies control as much as 90 percent of the global grain market, and the top four beef packers in the United States now control 85 percent of the beef market,"Booker said."These excessive levels of concentration and market power are devastating our independent family farmers and ranchers and hollowing out the rural communities in which they live. Farmers and ranchers are being forced to sell into ever more concentrated marketplaces that unfairly reduce the prices they receive for their crops and livestock, and unfairly increase the cost of inputs. In 1950, a farmer would get 41 cents from every retail dollar for the products he sold; today that portion has plummeted to 15 cents. This must change. It's time to restore competition to the marketplace, so that our farmers and ranchers can once again have the opportunity to share in the prosperity they help create.""At a time when corporate profits are booming because of agribusiness mergers, farmers are facing record-low income due to this lack of competition. Congress must act to ensure a handful of corporations do not control our entire food supply. The wellbeing of farmers and consumers alike depends on us preventing the nation's agricultural sector from becoming a full-blown monopoly,"said Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-01)."As a farmer myself, I see the urgent need to rein in agribusiness consolidation and it's why I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2019.""For too long, Washington D.C. has turned its back on its responsibility to ensure our economy works on behalf of the people and not corporate monopolies,"Joe Maxwell, a fourth-generation hog farmer and the Executive Director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, said."It is only through fair and open competitive markets that our economy can deliver an equitable and inclusive prosperity for all individuals who through their work and investment build the prosperity that is America. Organization for Competitive Markets applauds Senators Booker and Tester for their courage, vision, and leadership in filing this imperative piece of legislation."

The House bill is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Chellie Pingree (ME-01), Tim Ryan (OH-13), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09).==
Title: Pocan and Schakowsky Lead More than 70 Members of Congress in Calling on Boeing to Release Information on Anti-Union Activity

WASHINGTON, DC (May 22, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09)today led more than 70 Members of Congress in requesting information from Boeingregarding reports of retaliation against six union organizersat the company's South Carolina facility late last year. According to the reports, it appears that Boeing may have wielded their authority as a "self-regulator" to improperly dismiss three inspection employees.

Workers at the plant voted overwhelmingly in favor of forming a union with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) on May 31, 2018. However, Boeing has refused to allow employees the opportunity to bargain for fair pay and a safer workplace."As policy makers, many of us have already expressed concern in a previous letter about your company's ongoing refusal to recognize the union in South Carolina, and we write now because we are disappointed to learn that Boeing discharged six union supporters shortly before the holiday season last year,"wrote the Members."We are unsatisfied with the explanations these workers were given from Boeing for their dismissal, as well as the continued refusal to bargain with the IAMAW.""We understand that three of the terminated employees were allegedly discharged for missing a bird strike on an airplane engine in a post-flight inspection, even though the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) subsequently supported the fired inspectors' claims that there was no engine damage and no indication of a bird ingestion in the engine core consistent with a bird strike that would cause detriment to the airworthiness of the aircraft,"continued the Members."Given the ongoing concerns in Congress with Boeing's ‘self-regulation' with regards to safety, we are especially troubled by the impression in this case that Boeing may be wielding serious aviation security procedures as retaliatory tools against its own front-line inspection employees.

Pursuant to Congress's oversight of the FAA, the Members of Congress requested that Boeing provide the following information:

• How does Boeing account for the discrepancy between its findings and those of the FAA regarding the alleged bird strike incident that led to the termination of three Boeing employees?
• How did Boeing decide to terminate the three employees mentioned above and did it revisit the decision in light of the FAA's subsequent investigation?
• Were the terminated employees given a chance to appeal their dismissal following the FAA investigation that found no impropriety in the inspection?
• Given the important role unions play in ensuring proper workplace procedures and safety guidelines, what steps has Boeing taken to ensure timely recognition of unions that form at one of your facilities?

WASHINGTON, DC (May 21, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the President's most recent attempts to defy Congress regarding oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report."Regrettably, the President's most recent actions and continued disrespect for the Constitution are forcing us down the road to impeachment. Congress is a co-equal branch of government, charged with oversight of the Executive Branch and with the power to subpoena information and individuals. The President and his associates are engaging in a campaign of obstruction and lawlessness that undermines the rule of law and does not reflect the actions of someone who is ‘exonerated' as innocent."Congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight and get the information we need to deliver the truth to the American public regarding Russia's interference in our elections. Stonewalling Congress on witnesses and the unredacted Mueller report only enhances the President's appearance of guilt, and as a result, he has pushed Congress to a point where we must start an impeachment inquiry."==

WASHINGTON, DC (May 17, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Equality Act."Today is a truly historic day for civil rights in our country. With final passage of the Equality Act in the House of Representatives, we have taken the first step to explicitly bar discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity for every American. Regardless of who you are, or whom you love, you should have the right to live freely and openly."The road to equality has been long and filled with hard-fought battles, but we are making remarkable progress. Close to four decades ago, Wisconsin led the nation as the first state to enact legislation barring discrimination based on sexual orientation and I'm so excited that we are now working to expand this protection to everyone across the country."While we celebrate this great achievement, we must continue our fight for equal rights for the LGBTQ community. By trying to roll back employment protections and attacking those bravely serving in our military, the Trump Administration has doubled down on its disastrous record on civil rights. The Senate should join the House in supporting this legislation and reaffirm that every American can live a full life with the freedom they deserve."

As Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and an openly gay member of Congress, Pocan has long been an advocate for equal rights. He has been an out elected official since 1991, when he ran for the Dane County Board of Supervisors in Wisconsin. Pocan will continue to advocate for equality and hold the Trump Administration accountable for their attacks on LGBTQ Americans.==
Title: Murray, Baldwin, Pocan Introduce Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act

PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, DC (May 15, 2019)– Today,U.S. Reprsentative Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02), Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)re-introduced legislation aimed at reducing bullying and harassment, including cyberbullying, at colleges and universities around the country. TheTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2019would require institutions of higher education to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or religion. The bill also establishes a grant program to support campus anti-harassment activities and programs.

The legislation is named after Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who died by suicide after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over the internet. One in five college students are victims of cyberbullying, and LGBTQ students are nearly twice as likely to experience harassment as their peers."No student should be harassed or cyberbullied for who they are, or who they love,"said Rep. Pocan."Bullying is a real and persistent danger for many LGBTQ students at our colleges and universities, but there is no federal legislation that specifically protects students from being targeted based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And more than two years into Donald Trump's presidency, the Administration has worked to strip the rights of LGBTQ students as it rolled back regulations on equality at the Department of Education and directed the Department of Justice to file amicus briefs in support of discriminatory policies. With the White House's refusal to act, we must take a strong stance to ensure that all students are protected. That's why theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Actis so important, as it ensures that institutions of higher learning are a place of open expression, which celebrate diversity and embrace students from all different backgrounds.""No student should have to put their wellbeing, their safety, or their life in jeopardy just to access an education, but sadly we're seeing students around the country take drastic measures because of bullying and harassment,"said Senator Murray."In introducing this legislation, I'm calling on colleges and universities to step up and start taking responsibility for students' safety, and I'm so thankful for the support and partnership of advocates like Jane Clementi—who is fighting to ensure every student—no matter who they are, what they believe, or who they love—can pursue higher education free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying.""No student should have to live in fear of being who they are. Our schools should not be, and cannot be, places of discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation or violence,"said Senator Baldwin."This legislation, named in honor of Tyler Clementi, is an important step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to succeed in safe and healthy communities of learning and achievement. Everyone at colleges and universities across America should be able to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.""We are grateful to Congressman Pocan and Senator Murray for reintroducing theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, and fully support this legislation. We believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. Because every student deserves a positive educational experience in a safe environment free of harassment, bullying or humiliation, where they can learn, study and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school's care,"said Jane Clementi, CEO and Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation and Tyler's mother."No student should be subject to harassment or discrimination because of who they are or who they love," saidDavid Stacy, HRC Director of Government Affairs. "The past two years have seen a rollback of protections for LGBTQ students by the Trump-Pence-DeVos administration. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is a significant step forward in curbing anti-LGBTQ harassment and fostering environments that are affirming and encouraging for LGBTQ students. We thank Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Congressman Mark Pocan for their leadership.""Harassment is rampant on college campuses and undermines students' ability to thrive in a safe environment,"said Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of the National Women's Law Center (NWLC)."This bill is a critical step forward in combatting this scourge. It strengthens protections against harassment and would support much needed prevention and training programs. Every student in America deserves the right to learn without fear. This bill helps make that promise a reality."

In addition to Senators Murray and Baldwin, theTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Actis also cosponsored by Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Cardin (D-MD), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (IL), Feinstein (D-CA), Gillibrand (D-NY), Harris (D-CA), Hassan (D-NH), Hirono (D-HI), Klobuchar (D-MN), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (D-VT), Schatz (D-HI), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), Whitehouse (D-RI), and Wyden (D-OR).

WASHINGTON, DC (May 9, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), John Katko (NY-24), Andy Levin (MI-09), and Elise Stefanik (NY-21)today introduced bipartisan legislation that would assist in the implementation of existing professional standards for food service employees in schools. TheImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Actwould ensure that training occurs during work hours, and if training is unable to occur during scheduled work hours, the bill makes clear that employees must be informed in advance and compensated appropriately."Every day, our nation's school food service workers ensure that millions of American children receive the nutrition they need. While training has become an essential part of the role, many food service workers have become burdened by the cost and scheduling, making it difficult for them to meet the requirements,"said Congressman Pocan."Employees shouldn't be forced to stay late for training or be penalized if they can't attend it outside of their scheduled hours. The Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act eases the effects that completing this training can have on workers. I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation and am grateful for my colleagues support of this critical bill.""It is essential our children have access to nutritious school lunches, and cafeteria food service workers are key to delivering these meals,"said Congressman Katko."This legislation sets forth basic provisions to ensure that the individuals who work to make healthy meals in our schools are trained professionally and properly.""Food service workers make sure our kids receive nutritious meals at school. They are an essential part of our children's education and we should treat them as such,"Congressman Levin said."Food service workers deserve high quality, on-the-job training without having to pay out-of-pocket. That's why the bipartisan Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act is so important, and I'm proud to support it.""Food Service workers play a significant role in our children's schools, and we should make every effort to ensure they are treated fairly as respected and valued employees,"said Congresswoman Stefanik."These employees should not have to pay out of pocket with their time or money in order to receive training to effectively do their jobs. This bipartisan legislation ensures that Food Service workers receive training within work hours or are properly compensated for trainings outside of work hours. I'm proud to support this important bill and to stand with school employees throughout the North Country."

The reauthorization of theHealthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010enacted professional standards for food service workers. These standards worked to ensure that school meals are as healthy as possible for students. TheImproving Training for School Food Service Workers Actbuilds on these standards and:

• Ensures that training sessions occur primarily during work hours;
• Compensates workers for training sessions that must occur outside of work hours;
• Makes every effort to inform workers of training sessions that must take place outside of work hours;
• Does not penalize workers who are unable to attend training sessions outside of work hours; and
• Promotes hands-on, in-person training when appropriate, and utilizes online training as supplemental when appropriate.###==

WASHINGTON, DC (May 8, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Linda Sánchez (CA-38) and Mark Pocan (WI-02)today introduced the Strengthening Social Security Act of 2019."Social Security is the bedrock of the American retirement system. It ensures that after a lifetime of hard work, Americans can retire with dignity and some financial independence,"said Sánchez."Working Americans pay into Social Security with every paycheck to secure their financial future. The Strengthening Social Security Act improves on Social Security's promise and will ensure that the system is available for generations to come. I am proud to join with Rep. Mark Pocan to introduce this important legislation that will benefit the lives of millions of Americans.""Social Security is critical to Americans' retirement plans, yet it is increasingly falling short for the millions of seniors who have paid into it and rely on it. Through the Strengthening Social Security Act, we can ensure that this program meets the needs of America's seniors and allows them to live with dignity and security when they exit the workforce,"said Pocan."Congress must take steps to protect Social Security, and through this legislation, we can give seniors the benefits they deserve while also making sure the program exists for future generations.""The Strengthening Social Security Act would improve the lives of many millions of today's and tomorrow's seniors, Americans with disabilities, and children whose parents have died or become disabled. Not only does the bill increase Social Security's modest benefits, it also ensures that future cost of living adjustments will keep up with rising health care costs and other expenses that beneficiaries face. Social Security Works enthusiastically endorses this legislation,"said Nancy Altman, President of Social Security Works."On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the National Committee, I am pleased to endorse your bill, the ‘Strengthening Social Security Act of 2019.' This legislation extends the solvency of the Social Security trust funds while at the same time making needed improvement in Social Security benefits. Your bill represents a bold step on behalf of seniors and all Americans by strengthening and safeguarding Social Security. We look forward to working with you to enact this important legislation,"said Max Richtman, President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

The Strengthening Social Security Act will increase benefits, ensure the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) adequately reflects the cost of living, and improve the financial condition of the Trust Fund.

Specifically, this bill:

• Increases the formula factor for the first bend point to 95% over 5 years.
• Increases the first bend point by 15%.
• Replaces CPI-W with CPI-E for the purpose of calculating COLA's.
• Phases out the taxable cap of $132,900.
• Increases widow/ers benefits to the greater of 75% of combined benefits, or the Primary Insurance Amount.
• Holds SSI recipients harmless for any increase in benefits enacted through this bill.

Through these changes, beneficiaries can expect to see an increase in monthly benefits. While more needs to be done to preserve and protect Social Security for future generations, these changes are an important first step and will give seniors the peace of mind they deserve.==

It is shameful that the Attorney General so willfully engaged in a spin effort against the findings of the Mueller report just because the President's feelings were "hurt". The fact remains that at least 16 people involved in the President's campaign had at least 102 contacts with representatives of the Kremlin, and that Robert Mueller's team indicted 34 people in connection with his investigation – 7 of whom have already pled guilty."Guilty pleas from George Papadopoulos – former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, Paul Manafort – Trump's former campaign chair, Rick Gates – a former Trump campaign aide, Michael Flynn – Trump's former national security adviser, and Michael Cohen – Trump's former personal lawyer, are telling. No amount of spin can erase the record that already exists."==

Title: Pocan Leads Members of Congress in Reintroducing the Student Loan Refinancing Act
Date: April 10, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (April 10, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today led more than twenty Member of Congress in reintroducing theStudent Loan Refinancing Act (H.R.2186), bipartisan legislation which would remove the current restrictions on refinancing and allow anyone with a subsidized or unsubsidized federal Stafford loan, or a federal direct PLUS loan, to refinance the student loans whenever borrowing rates are reduced."Americans now hold more than $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, a staggering amount of debt that restricts Americans' ability to contribute to the economy and make other major purchases, like buying a home or a new car,"said Pocan."We must take steps to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt and allow millions of Americans to refinance their student loans, just like any other borrowers. Students deserve a fair shot at the middle class, not a multi-decade debt sentence. I'm proud to reintroduce the Student Loan Refinancing Act and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation to bring down the long-term cost of a college degree."

With student loan debt surpassing $1.5 trillion, the Student Loan Refinancing Act would help reduce debt on the nearly $1.4 trillion of federally owned student loans, allowing millions of graduates and borrowers currently repaying their federal student loans to refinance at a lower interest rate whenever a lower rate becomes available.

Currently, interest rates are at historic lows and homeowners, corporations, and state and local governments are refinancing to reduce debts. Refinancing allows the borrower to replace existing debt with a new loan with a lower interest rate, meaning borrowers will reduce the value of their debt, freeing up income for purchases and creating ripple effects throughout the entire economy.

However, student loan borrowers are being left out of this trend, and it is having a dramatic effect on the economy: 40% of graduates with college loans delayed making a major purchase such as a car because of college debt; 25% put off continuing their education or moved in with relatives to save money, according to a Rutgers University study.

Title: Members of Congress Introduce the Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act

PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, DC (April 8, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Tom Cole (OK-04), and Tom Suozzi (NY-03)today led a bipartisan group of Members of Congress in introducing the "Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act," which would reauthorize Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) for 5 years.

HKNC provides essential rehabilitation and vocational training to the deaf-blind community across the United States. The Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act would allow for Congress to continue funding the Center from 2019 through 2023 by means of the Appropriations process."For more than 50 years, Helen Keller National Center has provided critical services for deaf-blind Americans across the nation. With plans to expand to more states and regions, the Center will continue its long tradition of supporting those who are deaf-blind and giving them the opportunity to fully participate in their communities,"said Pocan."Since it was first authorized in 1967, Congress has made funding the Center a priority and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we can continue to support this important organization.""I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that would reauthorize the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults. For more than 50 years, the Center has admirably served deaf-blind communities and also supported those who care for and work with these individuals,"said Cole."Certainly, the Center's valuable mission, important work and role as a resource is worth affirming through reauthorization by Congress.""The Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, which is located in my district, is the only place nationwide which serves a population that is both deaf and blind. Imagine deaf and blind together. The Helen Keller National Center truly brings miracles to the families it serves."said Suozzi."That is why I am so honored to help introduce this bill. We must give them the help they need to strengthen their services and build greater capacity across our country.""Helen Keller National Center is very grateful for the bi-partisan support for the re-authorization of the HKNC Act. Established 52 years ago, HKNC is working with many partners across the country to strengthen and build services for and with youth, adults and seniors who are deaf-blind,"said Susan Ruzenski, Executive Director of Helen Keller National Center."The growth and collaboration among state and local partners has leveraged HKNC's resources and ability to impact the lives of people who are deaf-blind, their family members and the professionals who work to support the deaf-blind community in achieving employment and independent, self-actualized lives. The re-authorization of the HKNC Act validates the importance of our mission and we wholeheartedly renew our commitment to ensuring that each person who is deaf-blind has the opportunity to live, work and thrive in their community of choice."

Since it was first authorized by Congress in 1967, HKNC has expanded to support regional representatives based in California, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Washington. It has also created six new deaf-blind specialist positions so far across the country that will provide additional assistance and support to deaf-blind persons in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. HKNC's goal is to deploy 20 deaf-blind specialists (2 in each region) and it is also establishing a Community Service program in Los Angeles/San Diego with the goal of 4 others by 2020.

HKNC is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referral, support, and training exclusively to youths and adults who have combined vision and hearing loss. The Center also supports the families and professionals who work with the deaf-blind community.

Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) exists to enable people who are deaf-blind to live, work and thrive in the community of their choice. The HKNC Act calls for the Center to:

1. Provide specialized intensive services or any other services, at the Center or anywhere else in the United States, which are necessary to encourage the maximum personal development of any individual who is deaf-blind;
2. Train family members of individuals who are deaf-blind at the Center or anywhere else in the United States, in order to assist family members to provide and obtain appropriate services for the individual who is deaf-blind;
3. Train professionals and allied personnel, at the Center or anywhere else in the United States, to provide services to individuals who are deaf-blind;
4. Conduct applied research, development programs, and demonstrations with respect to communication techniques, teaching methods, aids and devices, and delivery of services; and
5. Develop and maintain a national registry to identify the deaf-blind population and their needs.==

WASHINGTON, DC (April 4, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the U.S. House of Representatives voting to invoke the War Powers Resolution and end authorized U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen."For the first time in American history, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have voted on – and passed – a measure to invoke the War Powers Resolution to end unauthorized U.S. participation in a foreign conflict. More than 85,000 children under the age of 5 have died of starvation since U.S. participation in the war began in 2015, and the war has left more than 20 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance."The U.S. has been deeply involved in the conflict, by providing weapons, logistical support, Special Forces, targeting assistance, midair refueling, and other participation to Saudi Arabia and its bombing campaign. The U.S. has also supported the Saudis as they impose a blockade on Yemen, preventing food and medicine from entering the country. Our continued participation in the Saudi-led coalition's war is unconscionable."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (March 28, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding President Trump stating that he has reversed course on the decision to eliminate funding for Special Olympics in the Department of Education's FY 2020 budget request."I'm extremely glad that the American people have convinced President Trump to do the right thing with Special Olympics. However, it shouldn't take public outcry and shaming to restore funding to one of our nation's most important special education programs."For the last three years, President Trump and Secretary DeVos have eliminated Special Olympics funding in the Department of Education's budget request. This was not a one-off mistake where President Trump is making a correction or having a change in heart. Rather, President Trump and Secretary DeVos could not take one more day of a bad news cycle and the public shaming on their cruel and outrageous cut to Special Olympics. Congress was already planning to ignore the Administration's disgraceful budget request, so this is only an attempt to save face. Further, the President doesn't have the authority to authorize spending."President Trump's budget is filled with misguided and dangerous cuts that will cause serious and lasting pain to the most vulnerable Americans. I'm hopeful that now President Trump has reversed course on Special Olympics, we can have a conversation regarding Social Security, Medicaid, the National Institutes of Health, and so much more."And by the way, can someone pull Betsy from under the bus?"==

With public school enrollment reaching more than 50 million students, we must invest in our public schools and ensure that we have a public education system that is preparing our students for the challenges that lie ahead,"said Pocan."Democrats and Republicans are coming together to celebrate Public Schools Week because we are especially proud of the public schools in our communities, the millions of students in our districts, the dedication of teachers, and the hard work of school administrators and support staff. Together, we can give our students and our educators in public schools the resources they need to thrive.""Our public schools have always been and will continue to be a critical asset to North Missouri and the country. The schools throughout my district do incredible work to educate our children. Our teachers and faculty are devoted to making sure they receive a quality education. This is evidenced by the outstanding graduates of our public schools who go on to make a difference here at home and around the world. Public Schools Week is a great opportunity to celebrate the successes of our students, teachers, faculty and administrators across the country,"said Graves."Our communities are stronger when everyone has access to a quality public education,"said Bonamici."As a proud public school graduate and parent of public school graduates, it is my honor to be a sponsor of the bipartisan Public Schools Week. Public education is one of the best investments we can make. I am grateful to all of the teachers, administrators, counselors, and support staff who help students thrive. I will continue to advocate for public education and for the resources our schools need.""During National Public Schools Week, we acknowledge the diversity and success of our public schools and the sound education they provide,"Thompson said."As a senior member of the Education & Labor Committee and a product of public schools, I know the incredible role our schools play in communities across the nation. A child's opportunity should not be left to chance, and every child deserves a quality, well-equipped school where they can learn, be inspired, and thrive. Public schools do that.

WASHINGTON, DC (March 25, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement calling on Attorney General William Barr to release the full report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller."Just a handful of individuals have read the Special Counsel's report, meaning nearly everyone who is making conclusions regarding it, has not read it. Given Attorney General Barr's role as a political appointee – as well as President Trump's record of essentially firing Attorney General Sessions over fears that he would not protect him, we must demand transparency and read it ourselves to draw our own conclusions. The American people deserve the full truth behind the Special Counsel's report and any attempts to censor it will be unacceptable. Attorney General Barr must release the full report and its findings to Congress and the American people."

The Trump Administration not releasing the entire Special Counsel's report is just the latest step in a long list of actions where the President has broken precedent and acted to serve his own interests in a way no other President has ever done. Ongoing Congressional oversight will continue in these and other areas. This list includes:

• Declaring a national emergency – when one doesn't exist – for border wall funding
• Refusing to divest from his businesses, a possible violation of the Emoluments Clause
• Refusing to release his personal and business tax returns
• Engaging in a cover-up scheme to pay off an adult film star
• Pushing for his son-in-law Jared Kushner to receive a security clearance

Title: Pocan Celebrates House Passage of For the People Act
Date: March 8, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (March 8, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today joined House Democrats in voting to pass H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a sweeping package of pro-democracy and anti-corruption reforms that will put the power back in the hands of the American people by ending the dominance of big money in politics; making it easier, not harder, to vote; and ensuring that politicians actually serve the public interest.

Pocan is a Vice-chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force, which introduced the legislation. Several parts of bills Pocan has introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives have been included in H.R. 1, including one that limits the authority of states to remove voters from election rolls based on interstate voter registration cross-checks, as well as one that requires the use of paper ballots on electronic voting machines.

Pocan also offered three amendments to the bill that were included in the bill's final passage. The amendments include one that creates a new, single lobbying disclosure portal, one that requires voting machines to be made in America, and one that would end the practice of prison gerrymandering. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he also secured inclusion of a provision that would require disclosure of the President's business tax returns."Today, the swamp in Washington took the most direct hit that it has experienced in decades when House Democrats voted to restore power to the American people, clean up the corruption in Washington, and reform our democracy,"said Pocan."With the passage of the For the People Act, House Democrats are making our government more ethical, expanding the right to vote, ensuring transparency by our elected leaders, and ending the out-of-control influence of big money in politics. These are concrete steps that will make a serious difference in our democracy and move us towards a system where government works for the public interest, not the special interests.""As an original cosponsor of the For the People Act, I'm grateful that parts of two of my bills, the Voter Roll Integrity Act and Secure America's Future Elections Act, were included in this legislation,"continued Pocan."Ensuring that voter rolls can no longer be erroneously purged of still-eligible voters due to the interstate voter registration cross-check program, a tactic that Republicans across the country have employed to exclude millions of voters, and establishing paper ballot and manual counting requirements for electronic voting to safeguard our elections from foreign interference are critical steps in restoring confidence in election outcomes.""I thank Congressman John Sarbanes for agreeing to include these provisions in H.R. 1. I'm also pleased that several amendments I offered were included in the For the People Act, including one that would create a single lobbying disclosure portal to increase transparency, one that would require voting machines to be made in America, and one that would end the practice of prison gerrymandering, which distorts representation at state and local levels,"said Pocan."Majority Leader McConnell should listen to the American people, stop his dishonest attacks on this bill, and bring it up for a vote in the Senate. The fact is: Republicans are against expanding the right to vote, ensuring transparency, and reforming our democracy because they know that a corrupt system is the surest way for them to win. Rather than strengthen the swamp, the GOP should join Democrats in restoring power to the American people and support this legislation,"concluded Pocan.

Pocan previously introduced theVoter Roll Integrity Act (H.R. 3091), which would strengthen voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters through the interstate voter registration cross-check program. He has also introduced theSecure America's Future Elections Act (H.R. 1562), which would address election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines and provide paper ballots, and mandate random audits of ballots to thwart interference.###==
Title: Schatz and Pocan Reintroduce Legislation to End Student Loan Debt Crisis
Date: March 6, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (March 6, 2019)– Today,U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) andU.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)led a group of 42 members of Congress in reintroducing theDebt-Free College Act, legislation that will reverse the growing student debt crisis in the United States. The bill restores a path to affordable college by providing states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education and provide students with debt-free college.

If signed into law, the Debt-Free College Act would establish a state-federal partnership that provides a dollar-for-dollar federal match to state higher education appropriations in exchange for a commitment to help students pay for the full cost of attendance without having to take on debt."The full cost of college – including books, room and board, and supplies -- is more than twice as much as tuition. If we are going to be serious about solving the student loan debt crisis we need to focus on the real cost to students and their families,"said Senator Schatz."My bill brings states back to the table and leverages federal dollars to reinvest in public education, and help people cover the full cost of college.""Higher education is one of the most certain paths to economic security and opportunity for Americans. However, while college-degree holders earn significantly more than workers with only high school degrees, the cost of higher education – including tuition, living expenses, books, housing, meals, and more – is now out of reach for many students and their families,"said Congressman Pocan."The Debt-Free College Act creates a critical federal-state partnership that would make debt-free college a reality for students within five years. With the federal government, states, colleges and universities, and students and their families all contributing, we can ensure that students graduate debt free and are not at a competitive disadvantage as a result of being burdened with student loan debt."

Beyond tuition and fees, the total cost of attendance—room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses—has forced 44 million Americans to take on debt to cover their financial need. College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student loan debt is responsible for 35 percent of the decline in homeownership since 2007. The percentage of younger people who reported owning a business was cut in half between 2010 and 2013. Pew Research Center found that about 50 percent of student borrowers say their loans increase their risk of defaulting on other bills."For far too many Americans, a college degree is out of reach because of the incredible cost – and for too many others, the debt incurred on the path to higher education makes long-term financial stability all but impossible,"said Congresswoman Lee."This is especially true for African American students and students of color, who are less likely to be able to afford college than their white peers and more likely to default on their loans after graduating. I'm proud to co-sponsor this legislation to make college more affordable for all Americans and to address the current crisis in student loan debt.""American students deserve a real shot at achieving their dreams, not a ‘debt sentence' if they choose to go to college. Unfortunately, too many students have had those dreams dashed by mountains of student debt and by rogue loan servicers hounding them into bankruptcy, which is why 11 of our members have brought a class action suit against Navient. They're shouldering $1.7 trillion of debt, often paying hundreds of dollars a month, partly because 41 states still spend less on higher education than they did before the recession. This pathbreaking bill will help stoke new investment instead of creating more austerity, which will help students graduate debt-free. We hope that Congress, state governments and higher education institutions will work together to turn this bill into urgently needed law,"said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers.

The bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

In the House, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Judy Chu (CA-27), Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Chuy García (IL-04), Jimmy Gomez (CA-34), Vicente Gonzalez (TX-15), Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03), Deb Haaland (NM-01), Katie Hill (CA-25), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), Gwen S. Moore (WI-04), Grace Napolitano (CA-32), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Lucille Roybal-Allard (CA-40), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), José E. Serrano (NY-15), Mark Takano (CA-41), Bennie G. Thompson (MS-02), Rashida Tlaib (MI-13), Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Peter Welch (VT-AL), and Nydia Velázquez (NY-07).

The bill is endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers, the Center for Law and Social Policy, Council for Opportunity in Education, Demos, Institute for Higher Education Policy, Jumpstart, NAACP, Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, Social Security Works, and Young Invincibles.==

WASHINGTON, DC (February 14, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement after passage of H.J.Res. 31 which will fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year and avert yet another government shutdown."I voted to keep government open while not giving any resources for Donald Trump's wall. There were also a number of programs that received additional funding that I supported such as a pay increase for federal employees,"said Pocan."In addition, the bill we passed has the same language as the last appropriation bill barring any funds being used for the President's proposed wall. However, I was disappointed there was not enough done to address limiting detention beds at the border.""A national emergency needs to be a true emergency. A national emergency should be used to address the gun epidemic in this country or climate change. A national emergency should not be used for a campaign promise the President has failed to live up to,"continued Pocan."I strongly disagree with the President's intention to declare a national emergency due to the lack of funding he's received for his pointless border wall. My guess is that there will be a legal challenge and an injunction to stop the President's unprecedented move, and he will fail again."==

WASHINGTON, DC (February 14, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)yesterday visited the offices of U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Washington, DC, where he distributed ‘missing' flyers for aFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) requestthat he made on October 12, 2018. Pocan's latest visit to the agency comes after he made an unannounced visit on January 30, 2019 and demanded to know the status of his request. Despite receiving the request in October, the agency was still unable to provide information during Pocan's visit in January, even after officials asked formultiple extensionsover the last several months."More than 120 days after I submitted a request to officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency continues to refuse to provide critical information regarding the arrests of 83 individuals in Wisconsin in September 2018,"said Pocan."Despite multiple meetings, letters, a FOIA request, and unannounced visits to the agency's office, ICE will not provide information regarding communication with local law enforcement officials and information about whether the arrested individuals held criminal records.""More than four months after submitting my request, the agency is clearly using delays as an effort to hide something. While we will not know until the agency provides the information, I have reason believe that the data on the arrests will show that ICE has targeted immigrants with no prior criminal record to stoke fear in our community,"continued Pocan."Should the agency continue to fail to provide this information, my next step will be to retain counsel and initiate a lawsuit."

Since the initial inquiry from Pocan over 120 days ago, ICE has yet to respond with the requested information. ICE claims to have responded to Pocan twice, but those responses contained only an acknowledgment of his initial request, and a statement that additional time would be needed to fulfill the request. Pocan still awaits information pertaining to ICE activities in Wisconsin during September 2018 that resulted in the arrest of 83 individuals.

Last week, Pocan broughtAissa Olivarez, Staff Attorney for the Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) in Madison, as his guest for the State of the Union. Olivarez is the first-ever full-time staff attorney at CILC, a nonprofit resource center which helps low-income immigrants with legal services. Her practice primarily focuses on helping those who are detained and going through removal proceedings, including some of the 83 individuals arrested in Wisconsin last September.###==

Title: Pocan, Kaptur Introduce Legislation to Protect Americans from Prescription Drug Price Gouging
Date: February 7, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (February 7, 2019)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Marcy Kaptur (OH-09)today introduced legislation that would penalize pharmaceutical companies that engage in price gouging without cause, leading to price spikes for patients who rely on medication to treat diseases ranging from cancer to addiction. The Stop Price Gouging Act, would hold drug companies accountable for large price increases and result in billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.

The Stop Price Gouging Act would:

• Require drug companies to report increases in drug prices, and justify the increase.
• Penalize drug companies that engage in unjustified price increases with financial penalties proportionate to the price spike."Despite President Trump claiming victory on declining prescription drug prices, the costs of many drugs are still skyrocketing and becoming increasingly unaffordable for millions of Americans,"said Pocan."The Stop Price Gouging Act will hold corporations accountable and protect consumers from egregious year-after-year price spikes that are far too common. While American families struggle over whether to pay an electric bill or buy life-saving medications, drug manufacturers and CEOs should not be making excessive profits. Members of Congress should immediately support this legislation and deliver results for the American people who are being hit with outrageous drug prices daily.""We must stand up to pharmaceutical companies that are more worried about lining their own pockets and bolstering profits for Wall Street investors than making sure patients can access the life-saving medications they produce,"said Kaptur."As policymakers, we must shine a light on price gouging. The predatory pricing practice must stop. The health and well-being of millions of Americans depends on it.""The purpose of medicine is to help people, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. Too many hardworking Americans still struggle to afford the medicine they need, and often, the culprit is price gouging by big pharmaceutical corporations. It has to stop. The Stop Price Gouging Act would protect Ohioans from prescription drug price spikes by requiring drug companies to report and justify their decisions to increase prices and prevent big pharma from price gouging,"said Brown."Too many New Yorkers are suffering because drug companies care more about their own profits than whether sick patients have access to medicine. That is one of the root causes of our country's skyrocketing prescription drug costs, and Congress needs to step in and solve this problem now,"said Gillibrand."This urgently needed legislation would finally hold companies accountable and penalize them when they gouge the price of a prescription drug without cause. I am proud to introduce this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to pass it."

Under current law, pharmaceutical corporations can increase the price of their products without justification. Pocan and Kapturintroduced this billlast Congress and said they would continue fighting to pass it this session of Congress. Any revenues collected through the Stop Price Gouging Act would be reinvested in future drug research and development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

In 2018, Americans spent an all-time high of$360 billion on prescription drugs. Nearly one-third of Americans polled byConsumer Reportssaid they had experienced a drug price hike in the past year, shelling out a total of $2 billion more for a drug they routinely take. Their 2016survey revealedthat 30 percent of Americans who experienced a hike in the price of one or more of their medications in the past year left a prescription unfilled because it was too expensive; 15 percent said they cut pills in half to make them last longer.###==
Title: Pocan Announces Aissa Olivarez as State of the Union Guest

WASHINGTON, DC (February 4, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today announced Aissa Olivarez, Staff Attorney for the Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) in Madison, as his guest for the State of the Union. Olivarez is the first-ever full-time staff attorney at CILC, a nonprofit resource center which helps low-income immigrants with legal services. Her practice primarily focuses on helping those who are detained and going through removal proceedings, including some of the83 individuals arrestedin Wisconsin last September."Over the last two years, the Trump Administration has manufactured a humanitarian crisis on the southern border and escalated detentions of immigrants with either no prior criminal record, or with minor offenses such as traffic violations. During this time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 83 people in Wisconsin, targeting our local immigrant community and breaking up families,"said Pocan."Throughout these events, Aissa Olivarez has worked tirelessly to keep families together and ensure that the government respects every individual's rights. Aissa's work is more important than ever and that is why I have asked her to join me for this year's State of the Union where we will stand in solidarity with our friends in the immigrant community.""Every individual has certain legal rights, and though they may be undocumented, people who are immigrants still have the right to feel protected in their own community and shouldn't fear law enforcement,"Olivarez said."When immigrants are detained and separated from family, it's easy to lose hope. Thanks to support from the Dane County Immigrant Assistance Fund, we were able to calm fears and ensure dignity to our neighbors. My goal as an attorney is to let people know they are not alone in this fight for their rights. I'm excited to join Congressman Pocan for the State of the Union and to raise awareness of the many challenges that immigrants face under our current legal system and under this Administration."

Last September, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids in Wisconsin that resulted in the arrest of 83 individuals. Following these raids, Pocan has attempted to gain information regarding the agency's communication with local law enforcement officials, as well as information about whether the arrested individuals held criminal records. Despitemeeting with agency officialsand submitting aFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, Pocanstill has not receivedthe information he requested. Last week, Pocan visited the agency's offices in Washington, DC and plans to release video footage of his meeting if ICE does not comply with his more than 100-day old FOIA request.==
Title: Pocan Introduces the 21st Century President Act to Clarify that Women and LGBTQ Americans Can Be President

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (January 17, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today introduced the 21stCentury President Act, which would change outdated legal definitions in the U.S. code to clarify that Presidents do not have to be men and their spouses do not have to be wives."In 2016, one of the two major party candidates for President was a woman with a husband and in 2020, for the first time in history, we may have more presidential candidates who are women than men, as well as a potential LGBTQ candidate who is married,"said Pocan."The U.S. Code should not assume that Presidents will be men or that they will only marry women, especially when describing which people will or will not be protected by federal law. While this language may have been accepted when the original law was enacted, it does not reflect the America of today and I look forward to ensuring that federal law recognizes this reality."

Currently, 18 U.S.C. 879 makes it a criminal act to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President, a former President, a candidate for President, or a member of their families, while referring to Presidents as men and to their spouses as wives. In recognition of the fact that we now live in the 21stCentury, the "21stCentury President Act" seeks to amend 18 U.S.C. 879(b)(1)(A) in the following manner:"(1) the term ‘immediate family' means—

1. with respect to subsection (a)(1) of this section, the wife(spouse)of a former President during his(a former President's)lifetime, the widow(surviving spouse)of a former President until her(the surviving spouse's)death or remarriage, and minor children of a former President until they reach sixteen years of age"###==
Title: Pocan Leads Democrats in Introducing Bill to Raise the Minimum Wage
Date: January 16, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today joined House and Senate leadership to introduce theRaise the Wage Act of 2019. The bill would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024, index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth, and ensure all workers are paid at least the full federal minimum wage by phasing out the subminimum wages for tipped workers, youth workers, and workers with disabilities.

Pocan joinedU.S. Representatives Bobby Scott (VA-03), Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), and Donald Norcross (NJ-01)in leading the introduction of the Raise the Wage Act in the House of Representatives with 181 cosponsors."A $15 federal minimum wage affirms the bedrock idea of fairness in our country: that hard work deserves a decent wage. We will open up opportunities for working families and drive economic growth that lifts up all communities – because our economy works best when it works for everyone, not just the wealthy and privileged few. I commend Chairman Bobby Scott and all our House Democrats for their leadership for America's working men and women, who are the backbone of our country,"said Speaker Nancy Pelosi."I was proud to help lead the charge to increase the minimum wage the last time Democrats held the House Majority. It has been too long since workers have received the raise they deserve. Democrats promised to improve economic opportunities for workers and their families in the 2018 election, and the introduction today of the Raise the Wage Act as one of our first bills in the Majority demonstrates our intention to keep that promise. I look forward to working with Chairman Scott and Education and Labor Committee Democrats to bring this legislation to the Floor following Committee consideration,"said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer."No person working full-time in America should be living in poverty. The Raise the Wage Act will increase the pay and standard of living for nearly 40 million workers across this country. Raising the minimum wage is not only good for workers, it is good for businesses, and good for the economy. When we put money in the pockets of American workers, they will spend that money in their communities. This bill is a stimulus for Main Street America,"said Chairman Bobby Scott, Committee on Education and Labor."Over the last decade, most working families have seen an increase in the cost of almost everything they need, yet their wages have barely moved. No person who has the dignity of a full time job should face the indignity of not being able to provide for themselves and their loved ones. This bill will finally give hardworking families in central Florida a much-needed raise - putting more money in their pockets to spend at small businesses and helping to grow our economy for everyone,"said Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy."I've worked for minimum wage and I was once a young single dad raising my son and having to balance work, family life and a checkbook. Back then it was hard. Today, for far too many Americans, it's nearly impossible.No American who works full-time should live in poverty. But that's exactly what's happening all around us, and Congress hasn't even voted to raise wages in over 11 years. When people finally receive $15 an hour, they'll spend more, become less reliant on government assistance and give our economy a needed boost,"said Congressman Donald Norcross.

Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a companion bill in the Senate with 31 cosponsors."Just a few short years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was ‘radical.' But a grassroots movement of millions of workers throughout this country refused to take ‘no' for an answer. It is not a radical idea to say a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be increased to a living wage of $15 an hour,"said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)."For a long time, Democrats have been trying to raise the minimum wage to keep pace with the times. The harsh truth of the matter is that the minimum wage is now a poverty wage in too many parts of America. And no American with a full-time job should be living in poverty. Despite campaigning as a champion for working Americans, President Trump has abandoned working Americans while in office. He's tried to strip away workers' health care, given a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy, and used workers as bargaining chips in shutting the government down. If President Trump isn't going to stick up for American workers on key issues such as raising the minimum wage, Democrats will,"said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer."There are millions of women and men across the country who work a full-time job, or work multiple jobs, and are still unable to pay their bills and make ends meet. Women make up almost two-thirds of minimum wage earners and it's even worse for women of color. So I'm proud to introduce the Raise the Wage Act today as one of the many steps we can take to ensure workers, especially the millions of women supporting their families, have the economic security to build better lives,"said Senator Murray, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

Title: Pocan Joins House Democrats in Introducing the For the People Act
Date: January 4, 2019
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (January 4, 2019)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today joined the new House Democratic majority in introducing H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a sweeping package of pro-democracy and anti-corruption reforms that will put the power back in the hands of the American people by ending the dominance of big money in politics; making it easier, not harder, to vote; and ensuring that politicians actually serve the public interest.

Pocan is a Vice-chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force and is an original cosponsor of the legislation. Several parts of bills Pocan has introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives have been included in H.R. 1, including one that limits the authority of states to remove voters from election rolls based on interstate voter registration cross-checks, as well as one that requires the use of paper ballots."House Democrats ran on a campaign platform of restoring power to the American people and cleaning up the corruption in Washington,"said Pocan."When millions of American voters made their choice clear in November, they delivered a strong mandate for us to govern and today we are taking the first of many steps to reform our democracy.""Republicans have long used the interstate voter registration cross-check system as a means of suppressing voters and refused to acknowledge the threat that foreign governments and cyber-attacks pose to our elections. However, Democrats are committed to strengthening the security of our voting systems, expanding the right to vote rather than limiting it, ending the out-of-control influence of big money in politics, and ensuring that our nation's leaders are working for the people,"continued Pocan."I'm extremely proud to introduce this legislation as an original cosponsor and I look forward to working with my colleagues on these reforms over the coming months."

Pocan previously introduced theVoter Roll Integrity Act (H.R. 3091), which would strengthen voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters through the interstate voter registration cross-check program. He has also introduced theSecure America's Future Elections Act (H.R. 1562), which would address election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines that provide paper ballots, and mandate random audits of ballots to thwart interference.

WASHINGTON, DC (December 17, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today sent aletterto the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling on the agency to respond to aFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) requestthat he sent to the agency more than two months ago. Despite receiving the request on October 12, the agency continues to ask for extensions to respond to the request for records regarding raids in Wisconsin, including the agency's communication with local law enforcement officials and information about whether the arrested individuals held criminal records."I am writing to follow up on a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for records pursuant to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's actions that resulted in the arrest of 83 individuals in Wisconsin in September 2018,"wrote Pocan."The FOIA request was initiated because the agency was unwilling to provide information and answers to simple questions about these enforcement activities. Since the initial request submitted on October 12, 2018 – two months ago – we have received two letters from the agency delaying the process without sufficient explanation.""The inability to provide this straightforward information or comply with the FOIA request in a timely manner underscores a very troubling lack of accountability that seems to be pervasive within the agency,"continued Pocan."Further delays on this request will not be granted, and I urge you to move expeditiously to provide the requested information. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."

Title: Luján, Pocan, Lynch, Boyle, and Schakowsky Introduce House Companion of Senator Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act
Date: December 13, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, DC (December 13, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Ben Ray Luján (NM-03), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Stephen Lynch (MA-08), Brendan Boyle (PA-13), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09)introduced H.R. 7294, the House companion ofSenator Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA)Accountable Capitalism Act.

Senator Warren introduced the bill in August to help eliminate skewed market incentives and return to the era when American corporations and American workers did well together. The legislation empowers American workers and aims to reverse the harmful corporate trend over the last thirty years that have produced record corporate profits for American companies but stagnant wages for American workers."I'm proud to partner with Representatives Luján, Pocan, Lynch, Boyle, and Schakowsky on this bill to empower American workers,"said Warren. "With the support of this powerful group of House leaders, we're one big step closer to helping American workers get the higher wages they deserve.""Throughout our country's history, the well-being of our workers has been directly linked to the prosperity we have achieved as a nation,"said Luján. "Yet today, working families in my district and across the country face rising costs of living and stagnant wages. Elevating the voices of workers in our corporate boardrooms will help restore balance in our economy. The Accountable Capitalism Act is an innovative and commonsense approach to level the playing field. I thank Senator Warren for her partnership on this effort.""Today, it's more important than ever that we give American workers the opportunity to have a seat at the table to make critical decisions on their rights and their future. Unfortunately, runaway corporate power is causing more benefits to flow to shareholders and CEOs, while families are struggling to make ends meet,"said Pocan. "I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing the House companion bill to Sen. Warren's Accountable Capitalism Act to take a strong step forward leveling the playing field for America's middle class. Together, we will empower American workers and build an economy that works for everyone.""I am proud to join my colleagues Representatives Luján, Pocan, Boyle and Schakowsky to introduce the House companion Bill to Senator Warren's legislation,"said Lynch. "Hopefully this Bill will help to rebalance the relationship for workers and give employees a stronger voice in the workplace.""American workers feel the system is rigged against them – and they're right,"said Boyle. "Washington has only exacerbated this trend. Look no further than the Republican tax scam and the record profits, stock buybacks, and stagnant wages we've seen since. Clearly we can no longer afford to sit back and hope corporations act in the best interests of their employees. The Accountable Capitalism Act represents a great step toward making that a reality.""For the past 40 years, economic growth has gone to the top one percent, and workers have seen their wages stagnate and their jobs shipped overseas,"said Schakowsky."Even with high profile examples like General Motors announcing its intent to perversely kill roughly 15,000 American jobs leading to its stock price increasing by five percent, the Republican majority over the last eight years has done nothing to right this wrong. In fact, Republicans have made things much worse by crafting that misguided tax bill. That is why I have chosen to be an original cosponsor of the Accountable Capitalism Act, a bill that will ensure the American economy gets back on track and works for everyone, not just the wealthy. I am proud to stand with my friend and incoming Assistant Speaker, Ben Ray Luján, on this important bill."

Since the passage of the Republican tax bill, American companies have done more than $800 billion in stock buybacks, while real wages for workers remain stagnant. There is an urgent need to end the grip of shareholder value maximization and return to the era when American corporations produced broad-based growth that helped workers and shareholders alike. The Accountable Capitalism Act:

• Compels company directors to consider the interests of all corporate stakeholders - including employees, customers, shareholders, and communities in which the company operates - by requiring American corporations with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter as a "United States corporation."This approach is derived from the thrivingbenefit corporationmodel that 33 states and the District of Columbia have adopted and that companies like Patagonia, Danone North America, and Kickstarter have embraced with strong results.
• Empowers workers at United States corporations to elect at least 40% of Board members:Borrowing from the successful approach in Germany and other developed economies, a United States corporation must ensure that no fewer than 40% of its directors are selected by the corporation's employees.

• Restricts the sales of company shares by the directors and officers of United States corporations:Top corporate executives are now compensatedmostly in company equity, which gives them huge financial incentives to focus exclusively on shareholder returns. To ensure that they are focused on the long-term interests of all corporate stakeholders, the bill prohibits directors and officers of United States corporations from selling company shares within five years of receiving them or within three years of a company stock buyback.

• Prohibits United States corporations from making any political expenditures without the approval of 75% of its directors and shareholders:Drawing on aproposalfrom John Bogle, the founder of the investment company Vanguard, United States corporations must receive the approval of at least 75% of their shareholders and 75% of their directors before engaging in political expenditures. This ensures any political expenditures benefit all corporate stakeholders.

• Permits the federal government to revoke the charter of a United States corporation if the company has engaged in repeated and egregious illegal conduct:State Attorneys General are authorized to submit petitions to the Office of United States Corporations to revoke a United States corporation's charter. If the Director of the Office finds that the corporation has a history of egregious and repeated illegal conduct and has failed to take meaningful steps to address its problems, she may grant the petition. The company's charter would then be revoked a year later - giving the company time before its charter is revoked to make the case to Congress that it should retain its charter in the same or in a modified form.

MADISON, WI (December 3, 2018)– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement regarding Wisconsin's Joint Finance Committee taking up legislation today aimed at weakening the authority of incoming Democratic officials."Wisconsin Republicans' shameful and undemocratic last-minute attempt to override the vote of the people is more becoming of a third world dictatorship than the birthplace of Fighting Bob La Follette and it must be stopped. Jamming the last days of the legislative session with voter suppression legislation and attempts at undermining the agenda of a newly elected Governor and Attorney General is a blatant attempt to override the vote by the people of our state."Republicans had eight years of the Scott Walker Administration to enact laws if needed, but instead, they waited until the last minute of an exiting administration to make an unconstitutional push for more power. As a former Co-Chair of the Joint Committee on Finance, I know that fast-tracking these bills is not only wrong to do, but also shows how wrong the Republicans know these actions are. By rushing these bills, Republicans know they are attempting to deceive the people."Wisconsin voters spoke on November 6, electing Democrats to the Governor's and Attorney General's offices, as well as other offices up and down the ballot. Governor Walker, Majority Leader Fitzgerald, and Speaker Vos should immediately reverse course and stop seeking to crack down on voting rights, thwart the incoming administration, and shove through laws that will have long-lasting damaging effects on Wisconsin families."==

The agreement as currently negotiated will not stop the damage done by NAFTA, including job outsourcing, wage suppression, and environmental degradation. In order to gain widespread support of Democrats in Congress, the agreement must contain swift and enforceable labor and environmental standards and must reverse special protections for corporations. We have been clear about these goals from day one, and I will continue to push the Trump Administration in the upcoming months to fulfill their promise of a new trade framework that supports working families."==

WASHINGTON, DC (November 29, 2018)– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ron Kind (WI-03), and Gwen Moore (WI-04),and U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)called for the inclusion of Wisconsin families, farmers, and businesses impacted by flooding in an upcoming tax package aimed at providing federal disaster relief. The tax package, which was introduced without bipartisan consideration, excludes Wisconsin from a long list of high-profile natural disasters."Wisconsinites working to rebuild their homes, farms and businesses deserve the same federal disaster assistance as those who caught the attention of the national media. We are calling on Congressional leadership to step up to the plate and give Wisconsinites a fighting chance as they work to repair and rebuild their lives,"said the lawmakers in a joint statement.

The letter, addressed to Speaker Paul Ryan, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, demands that Wisconsin, and all federally-declared disasters, are eligible for disaster tax benefits. The proposed tax package, introduced just this week, bypassed a full-committee markup in Ways and Means, on which Rep. Ron Kind serves, and is scheduled for a vote on the House floor tomorrow.

In disaster situations, targeted tax benefits are a commonly used way to help individuals and businesses recover. The proposed legislation would ensure losses from disasters are deductible; waive the 10 percent penalty for withdrawing funds from retirement accounts; and protect working families from losing critical tax benefits due to job displacement from the storms. The bill would also create a credit for farms and businesses that were destroyed, in order to retain the workforce while the operations rebuild.

In late August and early September, heavy rainfall, severe flooding, strong winds and tornadoes damaged and, in some cases, completely destroyed, homes and businesses across Wisconsin. Tragically, two Wisconsinites were killed in storm-related incidents. It is critical that impacted Wisconsinites receive the support they need to reconstruct their lives.

WASHINGTON, DC (November 2, 2018)–U.S. RepresentativesMark Pocan (WI-02)andRo Khanna (CA-17)issued the following response to announcements by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo regarding their intention to spur negotiations for a ceasefire to the conflict in Yemen within 30 days. The Saudi-led war and blockade on Yemen threatens to produce the worst famine in over acentury, pushing14 millioninto starvation; more than100,000Yemeni children have died from war-related causes over the past two years."Recent comments by Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo calling for a ceasefire in Yemen within thirty days are welcome, but are nowhere near sufficient. The Trump Administration has yet to condition U.S. military participation in the Saudi campaign on the successful outcome of negotiations. Rather than insist that the Saudi regime's adversaries take the first step toward peace, the Trump Administration must work to secure concessions from the Saudis to stop their brutal bombing campaign, ease their blockade of food and medicine, and end fresh assaults and military sieges on heavily populated centers,"noted Pocan and Khanna."Nevertheless, the Secretaries' remarks show the White House is sensitive to the increasing likelihood that majorities in both chambers of Congress will pass bipartisan measures to decisively end over three years of unauthorized U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war," thePocan and Khanna continued."The War Powers Resolution of 1973 guarantees floor votes to both House Concurrent Resolution 138 and Senate Joint Resolution 54, which would terminate U.S. logistical, intelligence, and midair refueling assistance to Saudi-led airstrikes within 30 days.""President Trumpaskedfor a bipartisan legislative solution to Saudi misdeeds in the wake of the murder of American resident andcriticof the war in Yemen, Jamal Khashoggi. This fall, then, President Trump should support the passage of H. Con. Res. 138 and S. J. Res. 54 to ensure accountability during these negotiations. If not, Congress will reassert its constitutional authority to stop U.S. participation in an unauthorized war that President Trump inherited, but which he shamefully expanded instead of ending,"concluded Pocan and Khanna.

The Representatives' skepticism toward the announcements by Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo stems from a pattern of similar comments from administration officials despite repeated Saudi military escalations over the past two years, with continuous U.S. backing.

In April 2017, when7 millionwere already on the brink of starvation, Secretary Mattisvowedto bring the conflict "in front of a UN-brokered negotiating team" to "resolve this politically as soon as possible." In March of this year, as Mattis lobbied against congressional action to end U.S. logistical, intelligence, and refueling services for Saudi airstrikes, the Defense Secretary againcommittedto "a negotiated settlement, and we believe our policy right now is correct for doing this." In September, Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis falsely asserted to Congress—after the infamous Saudibombingof 40 children—that the coalition was "making every effort" to reduce civilian casualties in order to continue U.S. refueling for the Saudi regime's deadly aerial bombardment campaign.

Pocan and Khanna, along with U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, are leading 75 members of Congress to end theunconstitutionalU.S.-Saudi war in Yemen with H. Con. Res. 138, expected to be voted on sometime in November.###==
Title: Pocan and Doggett Request GAO Investigation into Economic Development Subsidies, Including Foxconn

WASHINGTON, DC (November 1, 2018)– Today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Lloyd Doggett (TX-35), Ranking Member of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Tax Policy,wroteto theU.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)to request an investigation on the effectiveness of economic development subsidies, such as those provided to Foxconn Technology Group in Wisconsin. This request comes as the Center for American Progressreleased a new issue briefon the hidden impacts of these business incentives, including potential downsides often not considered by lawmakers, the press, or the general public."As incomes for the many workers have stagnated in recent decades, policymakers have looked to other tools to spur jobs and wages. Economic development has become a top policy priority. This is especially true at the state and local level, where elected officials have become increasingly willing to provide subsidies to incentivize business location or relocation as a means of job creation,"wrote Pocan and Doggett."According to the Upjohn Institute, these subsidies have tripled since 1990. For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker and the state legislature passed a law that would provide up to $4.5 billion in public funding to subsidize Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer,"continued Pocan and Doggett."Under even the most optimistic assumptions, the state is not expected to break even on the deal until 2043, decades after these officials will have left office."

Specifically, Pocan and Doggett are requesting the GAO conduct a review and issue a report on the following questions:

1. Are there reliable empirical analyses of the net economic effects of these economic development subsidies? Based on any available evidence of economic development incentives affecting business location decisions, what economic impacts have such incentives generated?
2. To what extent have large federal economic development programs been used to provide incentives impacting business location decisions and what evaluations have the federal agencies conducted to determine economic impact? How does the federal government evaluate the effectiveness of economic development policies within the federal agencies? Have such evaluations taken into account the incentives provided by state and local governments in incentive packages provided to businesses?
3. What kind of coordination takes place among federal agencies, such as the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration, and state and local governments?
4. Given the apparent expansion of such activities by state and local governments, what actions have federal agencies taken to enforce relocation and other provisions intended to ensure that program purposes are met?
5. What improvements can be made to processes at the federal, state and local levels to better understand the effectiveness of economic development programs and to what extent can federal authorities encourage further transparency in economic development?

Title: More than 50 Members of Congress Call on the Trump Administration to Release Evidence of Prior U.S. Awareness of the Saudi Plot to Capture Khashoggi
Date: October 22, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (October 22, 2018) – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Ro Khanna (CA-17)led a bipartisan group of 55 Members of Congress in writing to Daniel Coats, Director of National Intelligence, calling for the release of information regarding the U.S. intelligence community's advance knowledge of Saudi Arabia's plot to capture journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi. The letter comes as the Trump Administration continues to downplay the involvement of the Saudi regime's top leadership in the capture and death of Mr. Khashoggi within a Saudi diplomatic facility.

In light of the reported existence of U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials' plot "to lure The Washington Post columnist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi into Saudi custody," the Members "seek urgent answers as to whether Mr. Khashoggi was in fact contacted about the credible threat to his life and liberty posed by the Saudi plot to capture him." The Members of Congress also requested information on "the precise date on which any arm of the U.S. intelligence community first became aware of the Saudi plan to detain Mr. Khashoggi," as well as "whether the intelligence community will declassify portions of U.S. intercepts of Saudi officials relevant to Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance.""As you are aware," write the U.S. Representatives to Director Coats, "Intelligence Community Directive 191, issued in 2015, specifies the duty of the U.S. intelligence community to warn both U.S. and non-U.S. persons of threats of serious bodily injury, kidnapping, and intentional killing." Considering "the profound ramifications of this potential crime, U.S. foreknowledge of Saudi plans to detain Mr. Khashoggi, and whether the U.S. intelligence community carried out its duty to warn, we intend to use the full force of Congressional oversight and investigatory powers to obtain these answers should they not be forthcoming," concluded the Members.

Among the signatories of the letter are Ranking Members Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) of House Appropriations and Judiciary Committees, respectively. Both the House and Senate are poised to exercise oversight and investigatory responsibilities regarding this issue and others surrounding the murder of Khashoggi. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), for whom Mr. Khashoggi was a constituent, also signed the letter."We look forward to your timely response to our inquiry as both the House of Representatives and the Senate consider privileged resolutions this fall, such as H. Con. Res. 138 and S. J. Res. 54, which invoke Congress's sole constitutional authority over the offensive use of force to end illegal U.S. military participation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen," added the Members.

In his finalcolumnpublished byThe Washington Postbefore his disappearance, Khashoggi argued that "Saudi Arabia's crown prince must restore dignity to his country — by ending Yemen's cruel war." Khashoggi urged Mohammed Bin Salman to take account of the "poverty, cholera and water scarcity" afflicting Yemen as a result of the deadly air campaign that he had launched in 2015 with U.S. participation. Such high-profile examples of dissent are thought to have spurred Mohammed Bin Salman into ordering the capture of Khashoggi."In weighing the merits of U.S.-Saudi military cooperation," concluded the U.S. Representatives, "it is imperative that Members of Congress have a full, detailed grasp of the intelligence community's knowledge of Saudi actions and their potentially harmful impact on the wellbeing of U.S. residents and citizens, as well as any U.S. intelligence failures pertaining to Saudi activities that may have contributed to needless loss of life."

Title: Pocan and Khanna to Lead Colleagues in Calling on the Trump Administration to Release Intelligence on Prior Knowledge of Saudi Plot to Capture Jamal Khashoggi

WASHINGTON, DC (October 12, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Ro Khanna (CA-17)today circulated a letter to their colleagues, requesting that Members of Congress join them in calling on Daniel Coats, Director of National Intelligence, to release information regarding the U.S. intelligence community's advance knowledge of Saudi Arabia's plot to capture journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi.

In the letter, Members are seeking answers as to whether the Trump Administration's intelligence agencies performed their duty to warn Khashoggi of the credible threat to his life and liberty posed by the Saudi plot to capture him; the precise date on which any arm of the U.S. intelligence community first became aware of the Saudi plan to detain Khashoggi; and whether the intelligence community will declassify portions of U.S. intercepts of Saudi officials relevant to Khashoggi's disappearance.

The information is especially urgent as both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate consider floor votes this fall for privileged resolutions, includingH. Con. Res. 138andS. J. Res. 54, which seek to end unauthorized U.S.-Saudi military cooperation. Pocan and Khanna plan to send the letter to Coats next week.

The full letter is below.

Dear Director Coats:

TheWashington Postreportedon October 10th that United States intelligence agencies intercepted Saudi officials' conversations which demonstrated that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman,de factohead of the Saudi regime, ordered an operation to lureThe Washington Postcolumnist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi into Saudi custody and detention. Preliminary evidence made publicly available suggests that 15 Saudi officials, including aforensics chief and autopsy expert, likelymurderedMr. Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2nd.

As you are aware,Intelligence Community Directive 191, issued in 2015, specifies the duty of the U.S. intelligence community to warn both U.S. and non-U.S. persons of threats of serious bodily injury, kidnapping, and intentional killing. Any U.S. intelligence "element that collects or acquires credible and specific information indicating an impending threat" of those actions "shall have a duty to warn the intended victim or those responsible for protecting the intended victim, as appropriate."

The State Department'sCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017present evidence of a regular pattern of torture and physical coercion utilized by Saudi officials against detainees. In November 2017, for example, Saudi regime authorities began holding influential Saudi nationals in captivity. At least 17 individuals werereportedto have been hospitalized due to injuries sustained under physical abuse; one apparently died in custody with a twisted neck, a badly swollen body, and other signs of injury. Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri was also reportedlyphysically threatenedand intimidated by Saudi officials after arriving in Saudi Arabia in 2017.

Given your office oversees the U.S. intelligence community's duty-to-warn process, we seek urgent answers as to whether Mr. Khashoggi was in fact contacted about the credible threat to his life and liberty posed by the Saudi plot to capture him; the precise date on which any arm of the U.S. intelligence community first became aware of the Saudi plan to detain Mr. Khashoggi; and whether the intelligence community will declassify portions of U.S. intercepts of Saudi officials relevant to Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance. Considering the profound ramifications of this potential crime, U.S. foreknowledge of Saudi plans to detain Mr. Khashoggi, and whether the U.S. intelligence community carried out its duty to warn, we intend to use the full force of Congressional oversight and investigatory powers to obtain these answers should they not be forthcoming.

We look forward to your timely response to our inquiry as both the House of Representatives and the Senate consider privileged resolutions this fall, such asH. Con. Res. 138andS. J. Res. 54, which invoke Congress's sole constitutional authority over the offensive use of force to end illegal U.S. military participation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. In weighing the merits of U.S.-Saudi military cooperation, it is imperative that Members of Congress have a full, detailed grasp of the intelligence community's knowledge of Saudi actions and their potentially harmful impact on the wellbeing of U.S. residents and citizens, as well as any U.S. intelligence failures pertaining to Saudi activities that may have contributed to needless loss of life.

WASHINGTON, DC (October 1, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement today regarding the U.S. announcing a deal with Canada to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and enter into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."Despite President Trump claiming victory with a renegotiated NAFTA that includes Canada, it is clear that many missing details must be resolved before we can determine if this deal works for middle class families. We still don't know whether the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement will have the robust enforcement mechanisms that are critical to supporting working families, stopping the outsourcing of American jobs, and protecting the environment."Though I am encouraged by some progress in the agreement, including steps forward on labor standards and a rollback of special investment protections for corporations, I remain concerned about harmful environmental provisions, the continued waiver of Buy American rules, and intellectual property rights that limit access to affordable medicines. Over the coming months, I will continue to work with advocates from the labor, environmental, and agricultural sectors to hold the Administration accountable to their promise of standing up for working families and making real changes to our failed trade policies."==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 28, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement regarding a meeting he held with officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On Thursday, Pocan met with officials from the agency in Washington, DC, to discuss the recent raids in Wisconsin and the agency's communication with local and federal officials."During my meeting with officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, I asked many questions, but unfortunately, did not get many answers. The agency could not tell me how many agents are working in Wisconsin or the 2ndCongressional District, what offenses those detained had committed, the names of those detained or how we can get in contact with them, and whether agents followed proper protocol regarding medical conditions or minors. However, the agency did state that they would investigate these issues and give me answers."Here's what we do know: there is a list of 250 individuals that ICE is targeting in Wisconsin, of which they detained 83 during the raids last weekend. We also know that ICE claims that they reached out to local law enforcement, but we have asked for detailed call logs of who they attempted to contact and when. And finally, we know that the recent surge in arrests is a direct result of President Trump's immigration policy and that the agency is following his orders. We will continue to press the agency for additional information."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 26, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement regarding the arrests of 83 immigrants in recent raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Wisconsin. On Thursday, Pocan is set to meet with officials from the agency in Washington, DC, to discuss the raids and the agency's communication with local and federal officials."Despite numerous calls to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, my office only learned the details of last weekend's raids through the agency's press release. I'm disappointed that ICE did not relay details regarding the arrests to my office and instead decided to highlight a select few cases in outreach to the media. I demand further information regarding the individuals who have been detained with either no prior criminal record, or who have been detained for minor offenses including traffic violations."When I meet with agency officials on Thursday, I plan to ask why ICE is no longer focusing on individuals associated with serious crime, as well as why the agency has refused to cooperate with local law enforcement officials during these arrests. Additionally, I will press officials to explain why they were uncooperative with local and federal officials who sought answers both during and following the recent raids. These actions are unacceptable."==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bill to Place Moratorium on Ag Mergers
Date: September 13, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (September 13, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today introduced legislation that would impose a temporary moratorium on mergers and acquisitions between large farm, food, and grocery companies, as well as establish a commission to strengthen antitrust enforcement in the agribusiness industry. The Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2018 would seek to address the unprecedented concentration in the agriculture and food sectors, which is squeezing small family farmers, driving down wages for workers, and hurting rural communities.

In the last two years, chemical and seed company acquisitions and mergers have resulted in just three companies controlling two-thirds of the crop seed market. Further, over the last 30 years, market concentration has grown to the extent where the four largest multinational corporations now control of 71% of the pork market, 85% of the beef market, and 90% of the grain market. As big-agricultural firms expand, shares of profits for farmers continue to drop, and over the last 5 years, net income for American farmers has dropped by more than half."Out-of-control consolidation has enabled agricultural firms to control prices at every stage of the food chain, from farming to distribution, and Congress must do more to allow local farmers and food systems to be competitive, while establishing greater market transparency for the American consumer,"said Pocan."Today, corporate profits are soaring, but many middle-class families and farmers continue to struggle. Establishing a moratorium on ag-mergers will not only strengthen our antitrust laws, but it will also expand economic security and opportunity to more of our communities.""Today, a small number of giant companies control every link of our food chain. Consolidation has now reached a point where the top four firms in almost every sector of the food and agriculture economy have acquired abusive levels of market power. As a result, the U.S. is losing farmers at an alarming rate, agricultural jobs and wages are drying up, and rural communities are disappearing,"said U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ).

The bill, modeled after a similar proposal introduced 20 years ago by the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, would also establish a commission to study ways to strengthen antitrust oversight of the farm and food sectors and recommend improvements to merger enforcement.

Pocan's bill is the companion legislation to a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate bySenator Cory Booker (D-NJ)and is supported by more than 110 organizations. The bill has 5 original co-sponsors in the House, includingU.S. Representatives Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Keith Ellison (MN-05), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01).==

McGovern (MA-02), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Betty McCollum (MN-04), Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03), and Pramila Jayapal (WA-07)today released the following statement condemning the Trump Administration's recent actions harming the Palestinian people."We are alarmed by the Trump Administration's blatant attempts at exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories. The punitive measures employed by President Trump are intended to use the Palestinian people as pawns on the negotiating table for his administration's failed attempts to bring stability to the region."In the last month, the Administration has slashed $25 million of US assistance to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, rescinded $200 million in Congressionally allocated humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank, and halted all U.S. funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). By cutting these important aid programs, the Trump Administration will only exacerbate tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians, while further diminishing opportunities for lasting peace."Further, the Trump Administration has failed to push back on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's demolitions of Palestinian communities in the West Bank, like Khan Al Ahmar. We must remind our ally, Israel, that approving the destruction and upheaval of Palestinian communities slowly deteriorates the prospects for a peaceful and just resolution to the conflict."Finally, as we recognize the 25th anniversary of the Olso Peace Process, the Trump Administration's decision to shut down the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) offices in Washington, DC, is just another signal to Israelis, Palestinians, and the American people that they are not serious about engaging in the difficult diplomatic work it takes to achieve a lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The administration's refusal to endorse a two-state solution, provocative relocation of the U.S. Embassy and attempts to undo Palestinian refugee status severely undermines the United States' ability to play a constructive role in addressing the conflict. We urge the Trump Administration to put the lives of the Israeli and Palestinian people above politics."==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 5, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), and Debbie Dingell (MI-12)today issued thefindingsof their "Future of Work, Wages, and Labor" initiative – launched in early 2016. The Members spent over two years traveling across the country and meeting with experts, labor leaders, and workers to develop policy proposals that address longstanding problems in the workforce and new trends like automation and contract workers.The comprehensive report goes beyond just identifying problems and provides solutions and options to confront the obstacles today's workers face while preparing for the economy of the future."Today's culture of unchecked corporate power and maximizing profits has come at the expense of America's workforce. Worker pay is stagnant and inequality is peaking, all while CEO pay rates shoot through the roof, wealthy executives are rewarded with stock buybacks, and corporations are turning profits like never before. The American worker needs help and they need help now,"said Congressman DeSaulnier. "I appreciate my colleagues joining with me in this effort to advance worker-centric policies and ultimately make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.""Over the last several years, my colleagues and I have traveled across the country, meeting with hundreds of workers to discuss the ways in which we can address the most critical issues facing workers. The results of our conversations were clear: corporate power has reached historic levels, as has economic inequality and the weakening of workers' rights. These outcomes are not merely coincidental and they demonstrate a serious need to repair our economic system and ensure that America's working families are not left behind," saidCongressman Pocan. "Today's report provides a path forward that will restore real power to employees, rein in the unchecked power that corporations use to suppress workers and wages, and grow and strengthen the American middle class. With these recommendations, we can create real change and restore the American promise that a job can provide economic security, an opportunity to get ahead, a brighter future for you and your family.""To make our economy work for all of us, not just the rich and powerful, working people must be able stand and fight together for higher wages, better health care and a more secure retirement. I know how important it is for workers to have a voice in the workplace because I lived it. I sat at the negotiating table fighting for working families for decades, and I know we need to take smart, bold actions to help lift up America's workers,"said Congressman Norcross."I was proud to host my colleagues in South Jersey to show them the economic revitalization in the City of Camden firsthand and assemble a labor leaders' roundtable with the top advocates for New Jersey's workers. After travelling from coast-to-coast listening to workers, academic experts and community leaders in each other's districts, we've put together a package of solutions that will provide a bright future for working families – a future with higher wages, more job training programs and equal opportunities for all.""Our labor policies must keep up with the rapid changes the 21st Century has brought,"said Congresswoman Dingell. "We travelled the country hearing directly from workers. They told us the decline in collective bargaining, worker representation and the ability to form unions doesn't just hurt workers, it hurts our communities and our economy. Strong and updated labor laws are a necessity to fight income inequality, make the American dream accessible to anyone willing to work hard, and codify workers' rights for the future – this is what the report is all about.""The average American worker has not received a real raise in three decades. This is not an accident; it is the product of policy choices made across all three branches of government. We must do more to level the playing field,"said Ranking Member Bobby Scott, Committee on Education and the Workforce. "I commend my colleagues for their hard work in developing this report and welcome their proposals as part of Democrats' legislative agenda for the 116th Congress.""This moment of historic collective action calls for a different approach, one where technology leads to better pay and working conditions for everyone and even greater prosperity for us to share in,"said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka."At the AFL-CIO, we are nearly a year into our own comprehensive process focused on shaping the future of work so it works for working people."

During the effort, the Members traveled more than 4,700 miles and held 9 public meetings. They hosted town halls with over 250 local workers, consulted over 100 experts and academics, and ultimately developed over 30 policy recommendations.

The lack of adequate medical care, clean water, reliable electricity, and other necessities has created a complex humanitarian and security crisis."In Gaza, more than 50 percent of the children live beneath the poverty level, living on $1.74 US dollars per day. A report from the UN noted that 95 percent of tap water is not safe to drink, and last year warned that the Gaza Strip could become "unlivable" well before 2020,"Members wrote in the letter."The cut to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) will unnecessarily exacerbate the humanitarian and security issues in this region. As strong supporters of the United States' commitment to the safety and dignity of Palestinians and Israelis, we urge you to restore the vital contributions the U.S. makes to UNRWA and release appropriated USAID funding for humanitarian programs.""We believe the U.S. should encourage all parties to increase access to electricity flow into Gaza to meet the critical need for reliable energy. We should also push our partners to ease the blockade on the movement of goods, equipment and people in and out of the territory, especially for materials and supplies related to critical projects like medicine, hospital supplies and water treatment,"continued the Members."Alleviating the poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and lack of access to adequate, health, clean water, and electricity in Gaza is a critical first step to improving the security and safety of both Palestinians and Israelis.""We all recognize the serious security and political challenges in Gaza. However, U.S. support for the basic human rights of Palestinians living in Gaza must not be conditioned on progress on those fronts. For this reason, we strongly urge you to immediately restore all U.S. funding for humanitarian aid in Gaza, including all USAID funding under policy review by the State Department,"concluded the Members.

Title: Pocan Slams Trump Administration for Failing to Reunite Migrant Children with Their Families
Date: July 26, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (July 26, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the Trump Administration's failure to reunite all 2,551 immigrant children over the age of five with their parents by today's court-ordered deadline. The missed deadline comes two weeks after the Trump Administration failed to reunite all the immigrant children under age 5 who had previously been separated from their parents."Despite today's court ordered deadline to reunite families, President Trump's disastrous family separation policy continues to be a nightmare for hundreds of migrant families. With just hours until the clock runs out on the directive for the Trump Administration to reunite more than 2,500 children over the age of five with their families, it's clear that the Administration will fail to do so. More than 400 parents may have been deported over the last several months without their children – potentially as a result of misinformation or coercion from the U.S. government – further threatening to keep families apart without any path to reunification."Speaker Ryan and Congressional Republicans must join Democrats in speaking out and demanding that the Trump Administration do more to correct the human rights disaster it created. When kids who aren't even old enough to read or write are still behind bars, separated from their families, we cannot be silent. Clearly the Trump Administration had no plan to reunite these families and Congress must demand answers as to why it has failed to meet the court-ordered deadline."###==
Title: Members of Congress Introduce Legislation to Terminate ICE and Transfer Critical Functions to Other Agencies
Date: July 12, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (July 12, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) and Adriano Espaillat (NY-13)today introduced theEstablishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act. The legislation would convene a commission of experts to provide a roadmap for Congress to implement a humane immigration enforcement system that upholds the dignity of all individuals, which includes terminating the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) within one year of enactment."President Trump's blanket directive to round up and target all undocumented immigrants underscores the unchecked power which ICE has used to terrorize our communities. From conducting raids at garden centers and meatpacking plants, to targeting families outside churches and schools, the President is using ICE as a mass-deportation force to rip apart the moral fabric of our nation,"said Pocan."Sadly, President Trump has so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively. As a result, the best path forward is this legislation, which would end ICE and transfer its critical functions to other executive agencies.""There was enforcement of our immigration laws before ICE was created and there will be after ICE, as an agency, is gone. As it stands, ICE is out of control – contracting much of its work out to private, for-profit contractors that cost the taxpayers far more than is necessary, failing to even identify and address deficiencies in their system and allowing deaths due to substandard in their custody, as numerous Inspector General reports have found. The agency is simply unable to do the work that is most necessary for national security, instead taking away necessary resources from functions that are critical to protect our national security, including investigating terrorism, drug smuggling, and trade fraud,"said Jayapal."We should eliminate the agency as it stands and start from scratch to restructure its functions. This legislation would establish a commission to look at transitioning essential ICE functions to a new agency that would have accountability, transparency and oversight built in from its inception. It's time to change the system to one that is accountable, efficient, humane and transparent. There will still be enforcement of immigration laws, but it must be without cruelty and abuse.""We are pushing to bring an end to ICE as the agency has strayed too far from its original mission, intent and purpose,"said Espaillat."In the era of President Trump, ICE has been granted an unlimited range to terrorize Latino communities around the country, regardless of citizenship or status. The agency has a very broad jurisdiction and was created to combat terrorism, human trafficking, and drugs. Yet, ICE now spends the majority of its time detaining and separating mothers and fathers seeking safety for themselves and their children - instead of focusing on hardened criminals, gangs and terrorists set out to hurt our country and negatively impact our quality of life. We are witnessing a human rights crisis, and our bill would bring forward a new model and dismantle ICE once and for all."

Congress created ICE in the aftermath of the September 11thattacks with the primary mission of preventing "acts of terrorism by targeting the people, money, and materials that support terrorist and criminal activities." However, since then, ICE has become synonymous with immigration raids, home invasions, family separation, abusive detention practices, and chronic noncompliance with the law.

Recently, ICE agents themselves recognized the irreparable damage being done by President Trump's actions when nineteen ICE agents wrote to Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, stating that investigations, "have been perceived as targeting undocumented aliens, instead of the transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes impacting our communities and national security." The authors of the letter agree that the agency is now failing to perform its core mission and that the best path forward would be to end it and start fresh.

Ending ICE and developing a more humane immigration system that complies with constitutional protections, domestic law, and binding international treaties, while treating every person with respect and dignity is a strong step forward.

The Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act would:

1. Convene a commission of experts to provide a roadmap for Congress to implement a humane immigration enforcement system that upholds the dignity of all individuals. This will include transferring issues like organized crime, drug smuggling, and human trafficking to other government agencies that are well-equipped to handle them and have proven track records of transparency, accountability and compliance with the law;
2. Prior to the termination of the agency, direct Congress to act on the recommendations authored by the commission, including the transfer of necessary functions to relevant agencies and the implementation of the new immigration enforcement regime; and
3. Terminate the agency within one year of enactment.

The legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09), Jim McGovern (MA-02), José E. Serrano (NY-15), Adam Smith (WA-09), and Nydia M. Velázquez (NY-07).

Title: Pocan Statement on Supreme Court Ruling in Janus v. AFSCME
Date: June 27, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (June 27, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, which undermines public sector unions' long-held practice of collecting "fair share fees" for the services they are legally required to provide workers."The Supreme Court's decision in Janus v. AFSCME will have far-reaching effects for millions of American workers. The fact is that when unions are strong, workers have better wages, better working conditions, and ultimately, better lives. However, when unions are under attack and weakened by corporate and special interests, workers suffer. Today, President Trump and the GOP's donors won the latest battle in stripping protections for workers and further rigging the system in favor of millionaires and billionaires."As a 30-year union member and a lifelong resident of Wisconsin, I have witnessed first-hand the positive effects that unions can have on people's lives, as well as the destructive results when politicians, like Wisconsin's own Scott Walker, attack worker's rights. Despite today's Supreme Court ruling, I'm committed to fighting for public employees and ensuring that unions can continue to make a difference in working peoples' lives."Earlier this year, I introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, legislation that restores real bargaining rights to workers and repeals the right to work laws like those that Governor Walker has used to undercut American workers. We must stand up for the millions of middle class families who are under attack by Republican leaders and rulings like the one delivered today by the Supreme Court."

Pocan introduced theWorkplace Democracy Actin the U.S. House of Representatives in May 2018 and it currently has 58 co-sponsors. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate and it currently has 16 co-sponsors. The legislation would make it easier for workers to join unions in a number of ways:

• It would end "right to work for less" laws by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, which has allowed 28 states to pass legislation eliminating the ability of unions to collect fair share fees from those who benefit from union contracts and activities.
• Under the legislation, when a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards to join a union, they must have a union. Companies would not be allowed to deny or delay a first contract with workers who have voted to join a union. Unions would be given the right to have their voice heard through secondary boycotts and picketing. And workers would have the right to know when their company spends millions of dollars running anti-union campaigns.
• The bill would also stop employers from ruthlessly exploiting workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors or denying them overtime by falsely categorizing them as a "supervisor."==

WASHINGTON, DC (June 25, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today announced that he will introduce legislation that would abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), following his trip to the southern border where he witnessed the nation's immigration crisis. Pocan plans to introduce the legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives this week."During my trip to the southern border, it was clear that ICE, and its actions of hunting down and tearing apart families, has wreaked havoc on far too many people. From conducting raids at garden centers and meatpacking plants, to breaking up families at churches and schools, ICE is tearing apart families and ripping at the moral fabric of our nation. Unfortunately, President Trump and his team of white nationalists, including Stephen Miller, have so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively,"said Pocan."I'm introducing legislation that would abolish ICE and crack down on the agency's blanket directive to target and round up individuals and families,"continued Pocan."The heartless actions of this abused agency do not represent the values of our nation and the U.S. must develop a more humane immigration system, one that treats every person with dignity and respect."

Pocan's legislation would dismantle ICE and create a commission to provide recommendations to Congress on how the U.S. government can implement a humane immigration enforcement system that upholds the dignity of all individuals, while transferring necessary functions to other agencies.###==

WASHINGTON, DC (June 18, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)denounced Governor Scott Walker's deployment of two dozen Wisconsin National Guard members to the southern border to support the mission of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Pocan's statement comes just a day after he traveled to Texas to review the situation unfolding on the southern border of the U.S. During his trip, Pocan toured the Border Patrol Processing Center, the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge, the Brownsville Children's Shelter, and a detention facility."Governor Walker's plan to send Wisconsin National Guard members to the southern border is a misuse of state and federal resources, and only serves to give President Trump air cover for his outrageous and cruel plan to separate immigrant families,"said Pocan."During my visit to the southern border this weekend, it was clear that additional national guard troops will not alleviate the humanitarian crisis unfolding in shelters. Despite sufficient staffing, immigration officials in Texas seem content with slow-walking procedures and continuing the mistreatment of immigrants at the border.""Recentmedia reportshave shown that National Guard members from other states have been tasked with shoveling manure and changing tires, rather than actually watching the border. And while Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker has rescinded his offer to send troops due to President Trump's inhumane treatment of children, Governor Walker is committed to disrupting the lives of service members so they can complete mundane tasks,"continued Pocan."If Governor Walker wants to address the humanitarian crisis unfolding at the border, he should join me in calling on President Trump to end the practice of breaking up families."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (June 18, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02),Keith Ellison (MN-05), and Henry C. "Hank" Johnson (GA-04)issued the following statement today congratulating Iván Duque for winning Sunday's presidential election and urging him to fully implement and uphold Colombia's landmark peace accord."We congratulate President-Elect Iván Duque on his victory in a peaceful election, and applaud his public commitment to unite and serve all Colombians. Colombia finds itself at a turning point in its history. After more than 50 years of civil conflict that left hundreds of thousands dead, over 80,000 disappeared, and over seven million displaced, at long last it appears that peace is being made between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). The peace accord also provides a chance for Colombia to move away from organized crime, toward sustainable and legitimate economic development, and the full recognition of social, cultural, economic and political rights for disenfranchised Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities. Under a fully implemented accord, coca crops are to be substituted with licit products, helping to end the scourge of violence that has afflicted so many communities both in Colombia and the United States."In the spirit of advancing President-Elect Duque's call for national unity, we respectfully urge him to distance himself from those who seek to dismantle the peace process. Forces opposed to peace have been wreaking havoc in an attempt to sabotage the peace agreement, killing some 200 social movement leaders, human rights defenders, and other activists since the ceremony marking the beginning of peace in January 2017. Colombia teeters, in danger of falling back into an era of human rights atrocities, unending armed conflict, kidnappings, disappearances, and displacement. As before, these problems will not be contained within Colombia's borders, but will spread far beyond them."At this historic moment, and as Mr. Duque's government prepares to take office, we urge Colombians to unite around the objective of promoting peace and human rights. We ask Colombia's next government to continue to fully implement and uphold the historic peace accord. As a longstanding financial, diplomatic and security partner, the U.S. Congress stands ready to work with the incoming administration toward these aims."###

Pocan, Ellison, y Johnson instan al nuevo presidente electo colombiano a avanzar con el Proceso de Paz

WASHINGTON, DC (18 de junio, 2018)–Los representantes del congreso estadounidense Mark Pocan (WI-02),Keith Ellison (MN-05), y Henry C. "Hank" Johnson (GA-04)emitieron el siguiente comunicado el día de hoy para felicitar a Iván Duque por su victoria en las elecciones presidenciales del pasado domingo e instarle que defienda e implemente en su totalidad el histórico acuerdo de paz Colombiano."Felicitamos al presidente electo Iván Duque por su victoria en unas elecciones pacíficas, y aplaudimos su compromiso público a unir y servir a todos los colombianos. Colombia se encuentra en una coyuntura decisiva en su historia. Después de más de 50 años de conflicto civil que dejo cientos de miles de muertos, más de 80,000 desaparecidos, y más de siete millones desplazados, por fin parece que se está construyendo la paz entre el gobierno colombiano y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). El acuerdo de paz también le da la oportunidad a Colombia de abandonar el crimen organizado, adoptar un desarrollo económico sostenible y legítimo, y reconocer los derechos sociales, económicos y políticos de las comunidades Afro-Colombianas e indígenas, que han sido marginadas. Bajo un acuerdo completamente implementado, los cultivos de coca serán substituidos por productos lícitos, ayudando a acabar con el azote de la violencia que ha afligido a tantas comunidades en Colombia y Estados Unidos.""En el espíritu de avanzar el llamado a la unidad del presidente electo Iván Duque, le instamos respetuosamente a que se distancie de aquellos que pretenden desmantelar el proceso de paz. Las fuerzas opositoras a la paz han cometido atrocidades en un esfuerzo para sabotear el acuerdo de paz, matando a unos 200 líderes de movimientos sociales, defensores de derechos humanos, y otros activistas desde la ceremonia que marcó el comienzo de la paz en enero de 2017. Colombia se balancea y peligra en volver a caer en una era de atrocidades contra los derechos humanos, un interminable conflicto armado, secuestros, desapariciones, y desplazamientos forzosos. Como antes, estos problemas no se contendrán dentro de las fronteras colombianas, sino se esparcirán más allá de ellas.""En este histórico momento, y mientras el gobierno del señor Duque se prepara para tomar posesión del cargo, instamos a los colombianos a unirse con el objetivo de promover la paz y los derechos humanos. Le pedimos al nuevo gobierno colombiano que continúe con la defensa e implementación completa del histórico acuerdo de paz. Como un duradero aliado en términos financieros, diplomáticos, y de seguridad, el congreso estadounidense está preparado para trabajar con la entrante administración hacia estos objetivos."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (June 14, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today led a group of58 House Democratsin calling on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Rep. Gregg Harper, Chairman of the House Administration Committee, to include guidance on sexual orientation and gender identity as part of the Workplace Rights and Responsibilities education program attended by Members of Congress and staff. The Members also expressed concern that omission of this content was a deliberate decision, after learning that program facilitators were directed to explicitly exclude guidance about discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity as part of the training."Despite a stated objective of the training – to decrease harassment and discrimination – the program omits any discussion of discrimination in the workplace based on real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity,"wrote the Members."We are especially concerned that the omission of content on this subject may be a deliberate decision rather than a simple oversight. Upon completing the training and inquiring about the issue, a Member was told that the program facilitators were directed to explicitly exclude guidance about discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity as part of the training."While the stated goal of the training is laudable, comprehensive guidance on critical workplace safety issues requires a discussion of harassment and discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Any directive to exclude this content from the programming intentionally leaves congressional offices open to harmful workplace violations,"Members continued."Whether this decision was intentional or inadvertent, it is critical for the well-being of this institution and its employees that the programming is amended to include a discussion of these issues. As Congressional offices shine a spotlight on the importance of workplaces free from harassment, I urge you to update the content of the training to fully incorporate guidance on these issues."

Title: Pocan Leads Bipartisan Letter Calling on Pentagon to Withhold U.S. Support for Disastrous Assault on Yemen’s Major Port

WASHINGTON, DC (June 13, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Justin Amash (R-MI), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Walter Jones (R-NC), and Ted Lieu (D-CA)this week led abipartisan lettercalling on Secretary of Defense James Mattis to stop a disastrous military assault by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Hodeida, Yemen's major port city. In the letter, Members called for the U.S. to reject providing logistical, military, and diplomatic support for the Saudi-led coalition's operation, as well as disclose the full scope of the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war."We urge you to use all available means to avert a catastrophic military assault on Yemen's major port city of Hodeida by the Saudi-led coalition, and to present Congress with immediate clarification regarding the full scope of U.S. military involvement in that conflict,"wrote the Members."We remind you that three years into the conflict, active U.S. participation in Saudi-led hostilities against Yemen's Houthis has never been authorized by Congress, in violation of the Constitution.""We are concerned that in the midst of a Senate effort to exercise its constitutional authority to end unauthorized hostilities—including U.S. targeting and refueling assistance for Saudi-led airstrikes against Yemen's Houthis—the Pentagon may have concealed key information from members of Congress regarding the full extent of on-the-ground U.S. military participation in the Saudi coalition-led war,"continued the Members."We call on you to immediately disclose the full extent of the U.S. military role in the Saudi-led war against Yemen's Houthis, including the use of special operations forces; disclose any role that the Pentagon is currently performing, has been asked to perform, or is considering performing regarding an attack on the port of Hodeida; and issue a public declaration opposing this impending assault and restating the Administration's position that Saudi Arabia and other parties to the conflict should accept an immediate ceasefire and move toward a political settlement to resolve the conflict,"Members wrote."In light of a possibly disastrous offensive on Hodeida, we remind you that under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress alone has the power to declare and authorize war, and the War Powers Resolution allows any individual member of Congress to force a debate and floor vote to remove U.S. forces from unauthorized hostilities,"concluded the Members.

The Saudi-led war against Yemen's indigenous Houthi rebels, now over three years old, has created "the worst humanitarian crisis in the world,"accordingto international relief agencies,leaving17.8 million Yemenis, or 60 percent of the population, food insecure, and 8.4 million a step away from famine. The port city of Hodeida, already under a Saudi-imposed blockade, receives 80 percent of the country's food imports, and experts warned that an assault on the city could immediately threaten the lives of250,000 peopleand put millions more at risk of starving to death.

Pocan and Amash have previously worked together to raise concerns to the Trump Administration intwoseparatelettersregarding the humanitarian threat posed by a Saudi coalition attack on Hodeida, obtain the Trump Administration's legal justifications for the war, and call for the immediate end of U.S. hostilities, which include targeting and midair refueling assistance for Saudi-led airstrikes.

In September, Pocan joined Khanna, Massie, and Jones to introduce H.Con.Res 81, a privileged measure invoking the War Powers Resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from unauthorized Saudi-led hostilities against Yemen's Houthis. That resolution obtained 53 House cosponsors and led to acompanion measureto end U.S. participation, introduced by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Chris Murphy (D-CT), which 44 Senators voted to consider in March.

WASHINGTON, DC (June 11, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling inHusted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, which would allow Ohio to continue aggressively removing people from the state's voting rolls."The Supreme Court just empowered Republican-led states across the country to kick voters off the voting rolls, stifling democracy and creating an unnecessary burden for voters who find that they have been mistakenly and unfairly removed from the rolls,"said Pocan."Today's decision ensures that more voters – especially those that are young, minority, and low-income – will be turned away from the polls and not have their voices heard.""Congress should immediately consider the Voter Roll Integrity Act, legislation I introduced that would end interstate cross-check and ensure that that states must take additional steps before removing someone from the voter rolls,"continued Pocan."Governor Walker and Republicans in countless other states continue to commit various forms of voter suppression, all under the guise of eliminating voter fraud. However, we as elected officials have a responsibility to do everything we can to empower voters."

Last year, Pocan introduced theVoter Roll Integrity Act, legislation that would strengthen voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters. Specifically, the bill would ensure that states can only remove voters from their rolls based on comprehensive data that unmistakably demonstrates that the voter has indeed moved, and only after confirming with the person at risk of unfair removal.###==
Title: Following Myriad of Scandals, Pocan Offers Amendment to Fully Fund EPA’s Inspector General
Date: June 6, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (June 6, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)todayoffered an amendmentduring the House Appropriations Committee markup of the FY 2019 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. The amendment would have allocated an additional $12 million to the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG). Earlier this year, the Inspector General requested $62 million in funding, but House Republicans allocated just $50 million. Pocan's amendment would have fully funded the OIG's request."Administrator Pruitt is caught up in dozens of scandals, on everything from first-class travel and the installation of a $43,000 phone booth, to controversial meetings with industry officials and seeking to buy a mattress from the Trump International Hotel,"said Pocan."With this level of corruption, it's unlikely that there's a more overworked inspector general in the federal government today than the one at the EPA.""Republicans could have joined Democrats in ensuring that government officials don't erode public trust in our institutions and use their offices for personal gain, yet they instead signaled to Administrator Pruitt that he's free to continue his shameful behavior without consequence,"continued Pocan."President Trump keeps promising to drain the swamp, but you can't drain the swamp when the drain is covered with first-class tickets, phone booths, and old Trump hotel mattresses."

Several House Democrats, each highlighting a separate incident of Pruitt's misuse of his office,offered supportfor Pocan's amendment, including U.S. Representatives Betty McCollum (MN-04), Debbie Wasserman-Schulz (FL-23), David Price (NC-04), Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Pete Aguilar (CA-31), Katherine Clark (MA-05), Tim Ryan (OH-13), and Marcy Kaptur (OH-09). However, the Committee rejected the amendment in a 21-26 vote.###==
Title: Pocan Offers Amendment to Protect American Workers from Offshoring

WASHINGTON, DC (May 22, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)last night offered an amendment to the Republicans' Dodd-Frank roll-back bill that would have fought against the offshoring that is crippling communities across the country. The amendment, which would have ensured that banks that have outsourced more than 50 jobs in any of the last five years remain subject to stricter federal oversight, was rejected by the House Committee on Rules."Last year,Speaker Ryan saidthat the GOP tax scam would stop corporations from offshoring American jobs, but the banking industry, one of the bill's biggest winners, is nowaggressively sending jobs overseas. Today, Speaker Ryan and Republicans are again siding with corporations over workers and exacerbating the issue by allowing big banks to offshore American jobs as part of the Dodd-Frank roll-back. Offshoring not only takes jobs away from American workers, it sends harmful ripple effects throughout the economy and communities across the country."We need to enact policies that will expand opportunity for the American people, not allow banks to exploit the system at the expense of working families. My amendment would have instituted the right protections to crack down on banks trying to cut corners and offshore jobs, but House Republicans once again sided with big corporations, special interests, and Republican donors."==

"Hank" Johnson Jr. (GA-04), and Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03)released the following statement in response to reports that Israel Defense Forces have killed more than 50 Palestinians and injured more than 2,000 at the Gaza border today."We are shocked and dismayed by the lethal force used by Israeli troops against mostly unarmed protestors demonstrating at Gaza's border, which has led to the deaths of more than 50 Palestinians and the wounding of over two thousand people in one day alone."Over the past weeks of demonstrations, we have repeatedly urged Israeli soldiers to abide by international law and refrain from shooting live ammunition on protestors. We have also demanded that Gazan demonstrators show restraint and peacefully exercise their right to assemble and protest."We commend Israeli human rights groups and civil society leaders who are urging Israeli troops to refuse to comply with unlawful open-fire orders. Unarmed demonstrators breaching a fence is not an imminent threat to life, which is the only legal justification for the use of lethal force."President Trump's provocative decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem appears to have emboldened Israeli reactions to demonstrators, culminating in some of the highest levels of violence experienced in the area in weeks."We ask that Netanyahu's government show utmost restraint, allow for unfettered medical attention for those who have been wounded, and ease a 12-year blockade on Gaza, which has contributed to grave food insecurity, unemployment and a humanitarian crisis for Gaza's two million inhabitants. We believe the people of Gaza must be shown compassion and relief, and we remain steadfastly committed to ensuring Israel's security."==
Title: Pocan and Sanders Lead Democrats in Introducing Workplace Democracy Act

WASHINGTON, DC (May 9, 2018)– Today,U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)joinedU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)and their colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to introduce legislation that would strengthen the middle class by restoring workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions."Republicans like President Trump and Governor Walker continue to crack down on unions and push a special interest, corporate-driven agenda that makes it harder for middle class families to get ahead. And while they stack the deck against the American worker, unions are fighting to expand economic opportunity and strengthen the middle class,"said Pocan, a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades."The Workplace Democracy Act restores real bargaining rights to workers and repeals the right to work laws like those that Governor Walker has used to undercut American workers. I'm proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Sanders and stand up for the millions of middle class families who are under attack by Republican leaders.""We must no longer tolerate CEOs and managers who intimidate, threaten or fire pro-union workers, who threaten to move plants to China if their workers vote in favor of a union, and who refuse to negotiate a first contract with workers who have voted to join unions,"Sanders said."If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country."

Unions lead to higher wages, better benefits and a more secure retirement. Union workers earn 26 percent more, on average, than non-union workers. Union workers are also half as likely to be victims of health and safety violations or of wage theft, 18 percent more likely to have health coverage, and 23 percent more likely to have either an employer sponsored pension or 401(k).

However, the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined. Sixty years ago, nearly a third of all workers belonged to a union. Today, that number has gone down to less than 11 percent. When workers become interested in forming unions, 75 percent of private-sector employers hire outside consultants to run anti-union campaigns. An employee who engages in union organizing campaigns has a one in five chance of getting fired."The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. While corporate profits soar, working people are getting smaller and smaller shares of the wealth they create. Corporate interests are highly organized and fight like hell to make sure their interests are protected—in the economy and in our political system,"Rep. RosaDeLauro said."The Workplace Democracy Act aims squarely at that issue by simplifying the process for workers to form a union. We know that when workers are able to collectively bargain, they achieve increased wages and more substantial benefits—like healthcare coverage and retirement security. That is why Congress needs to act immediately on this legislation to make it as easy as possible for people to organize into unions and fight for a fairer economy.""Workers win when they band together and use their voices to raise wages and standards in the workplace,"said Rep. Donald Norcross, a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and electrician by trade."I know how important it is for working families to work together because I lived it. I fought for them at the negotiating table for decades. Now we must fight back against attacks on democracy in the workplace. We need to come together and pass this act to help restore workers' rights."

The Workplace Democracy Act would make it easier for workers to join unions in a number of ways:

• It would end right to work for less laws by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, which has allowed 28 states to pass legislation eliminating the ability of unions to collect fair share fees from those who benefit from union contracts and activities.
• Under the legislation, when a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards to join a union, they must have a union. Companies would not be allowed to deny or delay a first contract with workers who have voted to join a union. Unions would be given the right to have their voice heard through secondary boycotts and picketing. And workers would have the right to know when their company spends millions of dollars running anti-union campaigns.
• The bill would also stop employers from ruthlessly exploiting workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors or denying them overtime by falsely categorizing them as a "supervisor."

The bill is cosponsored in the House by Representatives Brendan Boyle (PA-13), Katherine Clark (MA-05), Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Keith Ellison (MN-05), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Robert C. "Bobby" Scott (VA-03), Mark Takano (CA-41), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12). The bill is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Edward Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

WASHINGTON, DC (April 25, 2018)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Dan Kildee (MI-05), and Hank Johnson (GA-04)todaywrote a letterto Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., calling on Israel to allow Members of Congress to enter Gaza. The Members are requesting permission to visit the area to oversee the appropriate and effective use of U.S. taxpayer dollars allocated to humanitarian aid for Palestinians living in Gaza. Pocan, Kildee, and Johnson visited Israel in 2016 and were denied the opportunity to visit the region by the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration to the Gaza Strip."As you know, the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza territory is quickly worsening, with nearly 1 million Gaza residents now dependent on emergency food assistance, in large part due to a decade-old land, sea and air blockade,"wrote the Members."In addition to nearly half of Gaza's 2 million inhabitants being unemployed and on food assistance, the United Nations has reported that ‘Gaza's only water source will be depleted, and irreversibly so by 2020, unless immediate remedial action is taken.' Furthermore, the provision of electricity remains well below what is needed to provide critical services, like health care and wastewater treatment.""Given the current situation in Gaza, our attention is required now more than ever. We can think of no reason to deny us access to Gaza again, short of making sure that outside officials not see the worsening conditions,"concluded the Members."With that, we respectfully request that the Israeli government expedite and approve our request to enter the Gaza Strip for the purpose of observing and evaluating the U.S.-financed humanitarian work."

"Hank" Johnson Jr. (GA-04)released the following statement in advance of demonstrations scheduled to take place on Friday within the territory of Gaza. The Members of Congress are urging Gaza protesters to carry out their right to assembly nonviolently, while also calling on members of Israel Defense Forces to exercise utmost restraint in the use of deadly force and to fully comply with international law."We are deeply disturbed by the tragic loss of life over the past two weeks of protests carried out within the territory of Gaza, with more than a dozen Palestinians killed by sniper fire – including an unarmed teenager and a respected photojournalist – and many hundreds more injured by live ammunition."While it appears that the vast majority of Palestinians who have gathered to protest have been peaceful, we object to reported cases of non-peaceful actions carried out by some Gaza protesters, and we call on them to exercise their rights nonviolently. We also urge Israeli soldiers to refrain from shooting live ammunition at unarmed Palestinian protesters from hundreds of meters away, across the fence separating the two territories."We strongly reject the dangerous contention made on April 8 by Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman that ‘there are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip.' Media reports suggest that on Friday, Israeli soldiers will once again be ordered by high command – in contravention of international law – to engage in sniper fire on Gaza residents who come within 300 meters of the border fence or engage in other non-life-threatening actions."We applaud Israeli human rights groups that are calling on Israeli soldiers to resist such illegal orders from their superiors, and are urging IDF forces to fully comply with international law and exercise utmost restraint in their use of deadly force. Such measures must only be used as a last resort to stop an imminent threat to life."==

WASHINGTON, DC (April 12, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding reports that President Trump is requesting to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership after campaigning against the agreement and declaring it dead last year."Should reports be true that he wants to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Trump would once again be abandoning the millions of hard working Americans he promised to serve. The reason President Trump won the state of Wisconsin is because of the issue of trade and re-entering the agreement would be a direct slap in the face to people who voted for him expecting that he would save their jobs and deliver on economic promises such as ending outsourcing."Members of Congress worked with organized labor, environmental groups, human rights organizations, and consumer advocates to defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership because we rightly believed that it would further decimate many vulnerable communities. The same old trade agreements are the wrong path forward for the American people and we demand a new trade model for agreements going forward."President Trump must live up to his rhetoric and deliver on trade agreements that stop the outsourcing of American jobs, protect our environment, and get rid of the special protections for corporations at the expense of the American people. Until the President seeks to enter into agreements that benefit the American worker, I will do everything I can to ensure that the United States does not rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership."###==

Now they are suddenly trying to show that they care about the budget with a sham vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment that couldn't even muster enough votes to pass."When Republicans are in charge, not only do they fight to kick 23 million Americans off their health care, give massive tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, and provide kickbacks for oil and gas industries, they do it while exploding the deficit by nearly $2 trillion. And before the ink was even dry on the GOP tax scam, Republicans immediately came after Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for it."American families will suffer under the cuts mandated by the Balanced Budget Amendment and Republicans should stop fighting for legislation that makes it harder for Americans to get ahead. Speaker Ryan, end the charade."==

MADISON, WI (April 9, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today responded to Governor Scott Walker'sletteroutlining his support for ‘President Donald Trump's aggressive actions to secure America's southern border.' Walker's letter comes three days afterPocan called on Walkerto refuse to send any National Guard members from Wisconsin as part of President Trump's plan."Governor Walker, let me be clear: arrests at the southern border of the U.S. are at ahistoric low. However, both you and President Trump are refusing to accept the facts and are instead twisting the narrative for political purposes to rally the Republican base. President Trump is resorting to desperate, last ditch efforts to shore up his political support after he couldn't get Congress to fully fund his border wall request, much in the same way you sold out Wisconsin to Foxconn for nearly$4.5 billionafter failing to fulfill your 2010 pledge to create 250,000 jobs in one, four year term. Failure seems to attract failure."President Trump is not sending troops to the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico. It is clear that his goal is to apprehend migrants, many of whom arechildrenfleeing violence in their home countries. Sending members of the Wisconsin National Guard to militarize the border against unarmed men, women, and children is absurd. Further, you will cause undue harm to the families of Wisconsin National Guard members as your actions are only being done for political purposes."First, mostdrugs are not smuggled across the borderby migrants that National Guard troops could apprehend. Second, if you truly wanted to solve Wisconsin's opioid crisis, you should sign Wisconsin ontolawsuits like those that other statesare leading against the nation's top opioid manufacturers. Governor Walker, your support of President Trump's plan for border security is wrong for Wisconsin and you should reverse course on this decision immediately."==

The current situation doesn't even come close to meeting that standard.""At a time of historically low border crossings, President Trump isn't offering a solution to any alleged threat that our country may face; instead, he is continuing to serve his personal folly at the U.S. border with Mexico,"continued Pocan."Our service members in Wisconsin should not be used as pawns while President Trump attempts to rally his base after Congress has repeatedly rejected his demands to build a border wall."

Title: Pocan Leads House Democrats in Introducing Debt-Free College Act
Date: March 22, 2018
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (March 22, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)led 23 members of the House of Representatives in introducing the Debt-Free College Act, legislation that will reverse the growing student debt crisis in the United States.U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI)led nine members of the Senate in introducing the legislation. The bill restores a path to affordable college by providing states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education and provide students with debt-free college.

If signed into law, the Debt-Free College Act would establish a state-federal partnership that provides a dollar-for-dollar federal match to state higher education appropriations in exchange for a commitment to help students pay for the full cost of attendance without having to take on debt."A college education is essential for entering the middle class. However, more students than ever are graduating with crushing levels of debt, making it extremely difficult to get ahead. With the cost of college skyrocketing over the last 30 years, many Americans can no longer afford the tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses that a college education demands,"said Pocan."We must end the reliance on debt as a way to finance a college education and the Debt-Free College Act is a strong step forward in making this a reality. It's time for us to rethink our approach to paying for college.""After the recession, states cut their investment in public education while college costs continued to rise,"Schatz said."We're at a point now where the full cost of college is more than twice as much as tuition, which is why solutions to the student debt crisis need to focus on the full cost to students and their families. My bill brings states back to the table and leverages federal dollars to reinvest in public education and help the people who need it most.""Every state in the country should offer debt-free college pathways for all students,"said Warren."That's why I'm glad to support the Debt-Free College Act, which leverages federal resources to give states an incentive to increase their investments in public higher education, bring down prices, and make sure students have a chance of making it through college without getting crushed by debt.""College costs and student loan debt are holding back an entire generation and creating a drag on economic growth for our country,"said Baldwin."We must embrace solutions like the Debt-Free College Act to help America's students and ensure that higher education is a path to prosperity, not a path into suffocating debt."

Beyond tuition and fees, the total cost of attendance – room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses – has forced 44 million Americans to take on debt to cover their financial need. College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.4 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student loan debt is responsible for 35 percent of the decline in homeownership since 2007. The percentage of younger people who reported owning a business was cut in half between 2010 and 2013. Pew Research Center found that about 50 percent of student borrowers say their loans increase their risk of defaulting on other bills.

The bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and by U.S. Representatives Judy Chu (D-CA), Yvette Clarke (D-NY), Joe Crowley (D-NY), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Jimmy Gomez (D-CA), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Jared Huffman (D-CA), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Mark Takano (D-CA), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), and Peter Welch (D-VT).

The bill is also endorsed by National Education Association (NEA), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Demos, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Young Invincibles, Credo Action, Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), Council for Opportunity in Education (COE), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), UnidosUS, and California State Treasurer John Chiang.==

WASHINGTON, DC (March 22, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the $1.3 trillion spending bill that the House of Representatives voted on today."Speaker Ryan and House Republicans have continued their record of pathetic governing with their latest efforts to fund the federal government. Releasing the text of a 2,232 page bill that spends $1.3 trillion at 8:00 PM last night and calling for a vote just 16 hours later is not how this process should work. Unfortunately, we won't know until much later what is actually in this bill, as not a single Member of Congress has read it. Further, the bill drastically increases military funding and does not include a solution to the President's decision to end the DACA program."Though the process to bring this bill to the floor was chaotic – a signature characteristic of the Trump Administration – on the plus side, President Trump was in fact the biggest loser. From denying his request for border wall funding and refusing to defund sanctuary cities, to reducing the number of detention beds for undocumented immigrants, many of President Trump's signature campaign promises were left out of this bill. Further, the Trump Administration's budget request was largely rejected, meaning that some proposed cuts to critical programs will not occur, and Trump-DeVos priorities such as new dollars for school choice programs will go unfunded. Today, the President lost the most."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (March 20, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today pressedU.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVoson several issues, including her position on gun violence prevention, her support for school choice programs, and her failure to visit low-performing schools.

During the exchange, Pocan asked DeVos if she would meet with students from Parkland, Florida, to discuss gun violence, but DeVos refused to commit to an upcoming meeting. Pocan also asked DeVos why she has not visited low-performing schools. He then extended an invite for her to join him in Wisconsin for a visit to one of themanytaxpayer funded voucher schools in Wisconsin that were rated by the state as "failing to meet expectations."

Here is the exchange, as delivered:

Pocan:"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here. Last night on our Facebook page, I said you were coming before the committee and got over 100 different questions, but I'm going to try to cover some of the topics they covered."I was very heartened to hear you say that the budget is about students, not special interests – it's about the faces of the students. A lot of the questions came in around gun violence. They're concerned not just about the faces, but the hearts, and the minds, and the lives of the students. If you go to school in the morning, you're able to go home alive at the end of the day. And that hasn't been happening."You once in an interview said, ‘I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.' Is it still your opinion that we need guns in schools to protect from grizzlies?"

DeVos:"Thanks, Congressman, for that question. If I had it to do over today, I probably would have used a different example. The point was that if there are going to be guns in schools, they need to be in the hands of the right people, and those who are going to protect students and ensure their safety. And that is the point."

Pocan:"So I appreciate that because I agree, there is not a grizzly bear problem in this country, there's a gun violence problem in the country. And then a few weeks ago, the President seemed to be on board with some sensible alternatives and then he met with the NRA and the sensible alternatives went out the door. Are you a member of the NRA by any chance?"

DeVos:"I am not."

Pocan:"You are not? Okay. I was wondering, specifically, do you know how many school shootings and incidences involving guns have taken place in schools since you were confirmed last year?"

DeVos:"Too many."

Pocan:"Yeah, so it's over 85. In fact, that number this morning increased – at least two people were injured in Maryland, seventeen lives recently in Parkland. In your comments you made a comment about trying to prevent young people from getting guns. Does that mean that you support banning the purchase of guns for people under 21?"

DeVos:"The President has indicated support for that. I think it's an important issue for this body to deal with. I would like to think that this body and Congress could go ahead and get progress on some of the things that are broadly supported and I encourage that, and the President has certainly encouraged that."

Pocan:"And so you support that?"

DeVos:"The President has said that that should be part of the consideration. That's actually part of the study that the school safety commission will be looking at and making a recommendation on."

Pocan:"So you support that?"

DeVos:"The President has indicated his support."

Pocan:"I gotcha, I gotcha, okay so…"

DeVos:"I have not reached a conclusion myself"

Pocan:"Someday we will find out where you're on it, but the President supports it. I got it. This Friday, the Parkland students are going to be up here. Would you be willing to sit down? I know you had a meeting with the President, but you didn't get a lot of one-on-one time. These students would really like to be heard. I'm staying an extra day, just to meet with them. Would you be willing to meet with the Parkland students? We'd be glad to facilitate a meeting."

DeVos:"I look forward to meeting with Parkland students. I have actually talked with a few of them about meeting them in Parkland at a time that is workable for both of us."

Pocan:"Sure, are you available this Friday to meet with them when they're in town?"

DeVos:"I don't know. I can't say right now what my schedule is then."

Pocan:"If we could just follow-up with that, we would certainly appreciate it."

Pocan:"On voucher schools, I want to associate myself with the remarks from our Ranking Member of the Committee on the GAO report, because I do think there are concerns there. I know in another interview, you made a comment just recently that you haven't visited poor-performing schools. I think that's another one you'd like to reel back."

DeVos:"As Secretary, I have made a point of visiting schools that are doing things creatively, innovatively, out-of-the-box thinking. I think it would be important to visit some poor-performing schools."

Pocan:"Great."

DeVos:"I think the question is, ‘Will they let me in?'"

Pocan:"So that's the exact place I'm going, but you and I are on the same wavelength. So you're willing to meet with some schools that are poor-performing schools?"

DeVos:"Absolutely."

Pocan:"Okay, so there are, according to a recent article in the Milwaukee Journal (Sentinel), at least 25 choice schools, which I know you're a big advocate for, that are performing way below the standards and level they're supposed to."I would love to meet you in Wisconsin and one of them that ranks the lowest, recently said, ‘We don't let people from the media in our building.' And they are the lowest of 121 schools in the Milwaukee area."I would love to go to one of those with you because I have seen the problems in my state, as you know we are one of the early adapters of the choice program – just to see exactly what that problem is. We have 140 private schools – voucher schools – statewide that couldn't be rated because they won't provide the information."Do you think that's right that the State of Wisconsin, as much as you want to give the state rights, can't even get the information from schools that are ultimately getting some sort of federal dollars because they are a choice program?"

DeVos:"Congressman, Wisconsin has legislated their program and their accountabilities to the…"

Pocan:"But do you think it is right? That is the question."DeVos:"I think parents and I think taxpayers…"

Pocan:"Do you think it is right?"

DeVos:"I think parents and taxpayers need to have more information, not less. And the goal of this administration and this department is to ensure that all children have an equal opportunity to access a great education."

Pocan:"So I'm going to take it that you think that they should have to report. Is that fair?"

DeVos:"I have been focused on ensuring that children and students and parents have opportunities to make the right education decision for them. And I support those parents in Wisconsin who have made choices for their children. I'm not going to comment on the Wisconsin method of reporting and accountability."

Pocan:"So you don't think those schools should have to provide the information?"

DeVos:"I think all parents need to have information and I think all taxpayers should have that information."

Pocan:"Okay, maybe if we get a second round, I can get more. Thank you."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (March 17, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today extended an offer of employment to Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, so that he can reach the needed length of service after President Trump fired him just days before he was set to retire."Andrew McCabe's firing makes it clear that President Trump is doing everything he can to discredit the FBI and undermine the Special Counsel's investigation,"said Rep. Pocan. "While Speaker Ryan and House Republicans have become complicit in the President's destruction of our democracy, we must do all that we can to ensure that the investigation into Russia's interference in our election is completed and that future elections are safeguarded from these kinds of attacks.""Myoffer of employmentto Mr. McCabe is a legitimate offer to work on election security. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy and both Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about election integrity,"continued Rep. Pocan. "From Governor Walker's outrageous voter ID laws that kept an estimated17,000 registered Wisconsin votersfrom the polls in 2016, to Republicans in Pennsylvania gerrymandering a map to rig elections in their favor, our electoral systems are under attack. We must take serious steps to not only secure our elections from foreign actors like Russia, but also ensure that the American people have faith that their votes matter.""Finally, I'd like to thank Mr. McCabe for his years of service to the FBI and our country. He deserves the full retirement that he has been promised, not to have it taken away as a result of the President's political games,"concluded Rep. Pocan.

Last year, Pocan introduced theSecuring America's Future Elections Act (SAFE Act), which would safeguard U.S. elections from future foreign cyber-attacks and interference by permanently classifying the integrity and security of U.S. elections as a key component of critical infrastructure. This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities.

The SAFE Act also addresses election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines to provide paper ballots, and execute random audits of ballots to thwart interference.###==

WASHINGTON, DC (March 16, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)released the following statement regarding the passing of Congresswoman Louise Slaughter (NY-25)."Louise Slaughter was one of the strongest voices in Congress for New Yorkers and the American people. From her work on the economy and trade agreements, to her role on the House Rules Committee, Louise was a fighter and a tireless champion. Serving with relentless passion, grace, and wisdom, Louise lent her voice and leadership to so many important issues."From my earliest days on Capitol Hill, Louise was there to serve as a mentor. Whether it was meeting to discuss the issues facing the American people or sharing a meal together, Louise welcomed me with open arms. With her passing, Congress has lost an extraordinary leader and a remarkable friend. My thoughts go out to Louise's family, friends, and staff during this time."==

WASHINGTON, DC (February 12, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement in response to President Trump releasing his FY 2019 budget proposal."The Trump Administration's budget is an attack on the very Americans President Trump promised to serve and it undermines the values we share as a nation. Rather than support an economy that strengthens the middle class, the promise of a safe and secure retirement, and the idea that every American should have access to lifesaving care, the Trump budget attacks programs that everyday Americans rely upon. We should make critical investments in health, education, and workforce development for the American people, not gut resources that allow millions of hardworking Americans to get ahead."From dangerous cuts to Medicare and Social Security, to slashing funding for education, housing, and workforce training and protection programs, the Trump budget will have serious consequences for American families. And while Republicans will hide behind the same old talking points of fiscal responsibility and hard choices, it is clear that President Trump and Republicans are engaging in a coordinated effort to further enrich the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. For months, President Trump advocated for massive tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, and today's budget further reflects that he is not working in the interests of the middle class, workers, students, seniors, and the poor."==

WASHINGTON, DC (February 12, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the Trump Administration's infrastructure plan, of which only a fraction of funding will come from the federal government."Reading scripted remarks and tweeting out vague promises to invest our country will not build roads and bridges – it takes public dollars to do that. Americans deserve a serious public commitment to rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, but under the Trump Administration's plan, communities across Wisconsin won't get the resources we need. With a comparatively paltry investment from the federal government over ten years – less than one-tenth of 1% of GDP – and no dedicated funding for rural broadband, the Administration's plan falls far short in resources, leaving many communities behind."The reality is that President Trump's plan is nothing more than an attempt to sell off public resources to Wall Street, to members of Mar-a-Lago, and to foreign investors. We need a real, comprehensive public investment that goes beyond traditional infrastructure, and covers not just our roads and bridges, but our water systems, broadband, and clean, renewable energy, as the Progressive Caucus has put forward in our21st Century New Deal for Jobs. We need a serious plan and funding commitment that prioritizes communities most in need and creates the millions of good-paying jobs, not more empty promises."==

WASHINGTON, DC (January 29, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement in response to comments made by U.S. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) earlier today."Speaker Ryan is a nice guy, but it isn't nice to write a bill that would kick 23 million people off their health care, or pass tax cuts that primarily benefit the top 1%, rather than his own constituents. Worse, Speaker Ryan has now collected $500,000 in campaign funds from the Koch brothers for passing tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. The sad reality is that Speaker Ryan has abandoned his Wisconsin values by refusing to face his constituents in a truly open town hall, which is at the core of our jobs, and by not standing up to the President when necessary."Republicans have zero credibility to discuss the state of political discourse in America or what is disrespectful or out of bounds. I must've missed Mr. Sensenbrenner's remarks when the President disparaged foreign countries as sh*tholes, called neo-Nazis and white supremacists ‘very fine people,' bragged about sexually assaulting a woman, or even reportedly asked his lawyer to pay off an adult film star using campaign funds. Apparently tax cuts for GOP donors come at any cost."###==

WASHINGTON, DC (January 25, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement after reviewing a memo authored by U.S. Representative Devin Nunes (CA-22). The memo includes allegations of misdeeds at the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)."Republicans trying to derail the investigation into Russia's interference in our elections infer that there is a memo that will blow the lid off the investigation and show political motivations behind the Department of Justice and the FBI. Their calls for the release of a ‘classified' memo are nothing more than an attempt to distract from the facts. I have read the so called classified memo, and I can assure you that it is all smoke and no fire. I too call for its release to, once and for all, end the FBI witch hunt."Rep. Nunes is the same Member of Congress who was so lacking in credibility that he was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation due to his partisan meddling and overt efforts to shield President Trump from efforts to get to the bottom of the story. This memo is full of inaccuracies and assumptions that only serve to give Congressional Republicans fake political talking points, while playing into their narrative to undermine the FBI and the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election."We must release the memo and all supporting documents to have an honest conversation and correct the record, rather than defaulting to Rep. Nunes's one-sided version of ‘truth.' These are serious allegations from Rep. Nunes and the American people deserve to see how he created these ridiculous fabrications to back up a baseless storyline."###==

However, complete Republican control is not a license to make outrageous demands and break promises to the American people. For the last several years, Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray have had an agreement on funding parity between the Department of Defense and non-defense domestic programs. Until now, Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell have honored that agreement. With their latest spending proposal, Republicans have once again abandoned the middle class and are refusing to negotiate."Most Americans want a long term funding solution for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers. And most Americans want to protect the futures of 800,000 young Dreamers. These are not complicated ideas, nor are they exclusive of each other. President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and Speaker Ryan must offer Democrats a seat at the table and address these urgent issues. The American people will suffer under a Trump shutdown and they deserve better than the hostage-style negotiating tactics that Republicans are undertaking."==

WASHINGTON, DC (January 19, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today led Members of Congress inwriting to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, urging the Trump Administration to continue to work with authorities in Burma to secure the release of two journalists from Reuters and drop the charges against them. One of the journalists, Wa Lone, visited Madison, Wisconsin in June 2016 to visit an elementary school class that participated in a book drive for children in Burma.

On December 12, the Burmese government arrested Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Earlier this month, authorities formerly charged them with violating the country's dated Official Secrets Act for their reporting on the horrific ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in the northern part of the country. The two journalists will have their next court hearing on January 23."Freedom of expression is under serious threat in Burma and the U.S. must continue to push Burmese authorities to end the trend of intimidation, harassment, and detention of journalists. One of the main recommendations from a U.N. commission formed to address the situation in Burma was to improve the freedom of journalists to observe and report on the situation in the Rakhine state,"wrote the Members. "In order for Burma to become a successful democracy, authorities must demonstrate their ability to defend and protect the internationally recognized right to freedom of expression, including freedom of the press.""Further, we strongly encourage the Trump Administration to continue the U.S.'s long history of embracing and protecting the freedom of the press. When a president denigrates journalists and their reporting as fake news, it gives license to other countries to crack down on the freedom of press, which can include intimidating, jailing, and torturing members of the media,"continued the Members. "The U.S. must continue to serve as an example for other countries, rather than allow oppressive regimes to take a cue and act in the same style as Burma."

WASHINGTON, DC (January 17, 2018)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today delivered remarks on the House Floor, calling on Members of Congress to speak out against President Trump's racist rhetoric. During his remarks, Pocan noted that Speaker Paul Ryan took 19 hours and 53 minutes to respond to the President's comments, blandly describing the racist remarks as "unfortunate" and "unhelpful."

Clickhereto watch the full video.

Here are the remarks, as delivered:

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In bizarre Washington news of the last week, the raging controversy is whether the President of the United States referred to other countries and a continent as s---holes or s---houses.

As if either word means a drop of difference, especially when you insult other nations in the world as our President did.

Equally worrisome is that the leadership of this branch of government, the U.S. House of Representatives – a co-equal branch of government – has been complicit or silent about how to respond to the comments made by our President.

In fact, Speaker Paul Ryan took 19 hours and 53 minutes to respond – and with all that time – enough time to have driven from Washington to Dallas, Texas, or to watch the movie Jaws nine times – what was his stinging and necessary rebuke after that much time and thought?"Unfortunate."

The Speaker said the president's comments were "unfortunate" and "unhelpful." Look, it's unfortunate when you walk outside and step in a puddle of water. This was more like walking into a global sized pile of s---.

We are not on the staff of the White House. We are a co-equal branch of government. And it's about time we acted like it.

Saying nothing or basically nothing is unacceptable. We need to put our country before our political party.

Calling other countries, and even a continent, names like s---holes or s---houses puts our service members and our Americans overseas at greater risk. And weak words or silence makes Congress complicit with the President's racist rhetoric.

And by the way, people outside of the beltway just think Congress is full of s---. Everyone else had the proper response to the President's comments. That they were just pure "BS."

I yield back.==

"According to some estimates, over $80 billion will be required to reach areas in the United States without service. Your Administration should lead on this effort by requesting full financial backing of rural broadband.""Regardless of political party or zip code, all Americans deserve equal access to the great potential of the internet,"continued the Members. "Investments in expanding connectivity will pay dividends in economic growth, in addition to linking people to communication, education, medicine, entertainment and much more."

WASHINGTON, DC (December 19, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the final version of the Republican tax bill, which was passed today in the House of Representatives."Speaker Ryan and House Republicans just passed one of the biggest legislative scams in American history. Despite all of the rhetoric, lofty promises, and downright lies, the GOP tax bill is not written for the middle class, it's written for corporations and the wealthy. Today, Speaker Ryan and Republicans confirmed loud and clear that their priority is to help corporate and special interests at the expense of working families in Wisconsin and across the United States."Make no mistake, the Republican tax plan will negatively impact millions of American families, but what Speaker Ryan will do next is even worse. The handouts to corporations and the wealthy from this bill are so drastic that they are projected to balloon the deficit by more than $1.4 trillion, and Speaker Ryan is already planning to use this as an excuse to make massive cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security."And while Speaker Ryan has been fighting to give corporations tax cuts at the expense of the middle class, he's neglected to reauthorize critical services like the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Federal Perkins Loans Program. When Congress returns in January, I will do all that I can to fight for working families and stop Speaker Ryan's radical agenda from doing more harm."###==

In the brief, the Trump Administration argues that the fair-share fees that public employee unions charge union non-members violate workers' First Amendment rights."Despite campaigning on a promise of supporting American workers, President Trump is once again doing everything he can to attack them. The Trump Administration's stunning reversal on Janus v. AFSCME, done in the middle of the night, is just the latest example of the President making false statements to millions of Americans who put their faith in him. President Trump appealed to hard working voters, but he is governing solely for the wealthy donor class who funded his campaign."With this brief, it is clear that President Trump has no plans to raise wages, create jobs, or grow and strengthen the middle class. Rather, President Trump is engaging in a coordinated effort with Republicans in Washington to dismantle unions, rig the economy against American workers, and give handouts to the wealthy and corporations.

After months of Congressional pressure, President Trump has finally issued a much-needed demand that the Saudis completely allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people."If the Saudis refuse this urgent call, millions of innocent people will die. And while President Trump's words are a good starting point, Congress must take additional action to end the United States' unauthorized military involvement in Yemen by adopting H.Con.Res.81. We must send a powerful signal that our country will no longer be complicit in the use of starvation as a tool of war. Through open and transparent congressional debate, we can end the prolonged suffering in Yemen."Nowhere else on earth today is there a catastrophe that is so profound and affects so many lives, yet could be so easy to resolve: halt the bombing, end the blockade, and let food, medicine, and fuel into Yemen so that millions may live."==

Unfortunately, they were denied that opportunity and experienced the same discrimination many of us in the LGBTQ community know all too well."Every American deserves the right to live their life without facing discrimination because of who they are or who they love. And while I hope that the Supreme Court makes the right decision in this case, there is still much more work to be done. Across the country, Americans can be kicked out of their homes, denied services, and fired from their jobs just for being gay. We must continue to fight to ensure that every American can live their life with dignity and equality."==

WASHINGTON, DC (November 30, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today announced the findings of a newGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) reportregarding taxpayer funded school voucher programs and how they are failing to provide students with equitable opportunity. As part of the report Pocan requested, the GAO studied 27 taxpayer funded private school voucher and education savings account programs in the 2016-2017 school year."The new report from GAO shows the outrageously low standards to which many school voucher programs are held. As Secretary DeVos continues her assault on public education and efforts to privatize schools, it is more important than ever to ensure that these programs are held accountable,"said Rep. Pocan. "Every student deserves the opportunity to go to a school that meets their needs and every parent should have the guarantee that their child is in a safe, equitable, and successful environment. The U.S. Department of Education must address the concerns in this report and should immediately institute the GAO's recommendations. Our students deserve nothing less.""Betsy DeVos has made expanding private school vouchers and voucher-like schemes the centerpiece of her agenda, including pushing for these schemes at the federal level. This GAO report highlights how vouchers hurt, not help, students with disabilities,"said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. "The federal government should be working to support students with disabilities, not undermining their federal rights and protections.""Congress should amend IDEA immediately to ensure that parents of children with disabilities know the important rights and services they are leaving behind when they take a private school voucher,"said Daniel Domenech, Executive Director of the American Association of School Administrators. "These scathing findings detailing the lack of transparency and accountability in state voucher programs by a nonpartisan government office should concern all taxpayers, but particularly families with children in public school who see their dollars ripped out of the public school system to support these deeply flawed programs."

Of the 27 programs studied by the GAO, only 8 of the programs required private schools to comply with annual financial audits, meaning that the states funding the schools often had no clear understanding of the programs the investments are funding. The GAO also found that many of the programs lack accountability and transparency when it comes to disability protections, education standards, professional standards, and information distributed to parents.

Findings from the GAO report include:

• Only about half of the private schools participating in voucher programs provided special education or disability related information on their websites, creating a significant problem for families making a decision about where to send their children.
• Private school voucher programs are inconsistently providing information on changes in key protections and rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when parents move a child with a disability from a public to a private school.
• 83% of students who were enrolled in a program specifically designed for students with disabilities were enrolled in one that either provided no information or inaccurate information regarding the changes in IDEA rights.
• One third of the 27 programs operating in school year 2016-17 had no academic testing requirements and officials in two of the programs interviewed indicated that some private schools were unfamiliar or unequipped to administer standardized tests.
• Only one third of the programs require schools to publicly report test results.
• Only four programs provided information on the graduation rates at participating schools.
• Only an estimated 13% of all private schools participating in voucher programs provide student and school performance data on their websites.
• Just seventeen of the programs required background checks on all employees or on employees with direct and unsupervised contact with children.

This legislation will now move on to the Senate, where Republicans plan to jam through provisions to strip approximately 13 million Americans of their care, in addition to giving a massive tax windfall for corporations and the wealthy."Speaker Ryan and House Republicans just voted to raise taxes on the middle class. Why? To give the wealthiest Americans and corporations a multi-trillion dollar tax giveaway. While I'm still recovering from my recent heart surgery, had I been in Washington, my vote would not have been a ‘no,' it would have been a ‘hell no'."The GOP tax plan even makes the middle class pay for tax breaks for corporations that outsource their jobs to foreign countries. Rather than developing a plan that would expand economic opportunities and strengthen the middle class, Speaker Ryan and House Republicans are further rigging the economy against the American people."Republicans claim they are doubling the standard deduction, but in reality, they eliminated deductions like those for state and local taxes, student loan interest, and medical expenses, raising taxes on 36 million middle class households. Hundreds of thousands of Speaker Ryan's own constituents rely on these deductions, includingmany that utilizethe state and local tax deduction."Speaker Ryan was wrong to shove this tax plan through Congress in a two week span without holding a single hearing with those who will be most affected – the middle class.

Title: Pocan Leads Bipartisan Letter Calling for Protection of ‘Buy American’ Requirements
Date: November 7, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (November 7, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)last week led a bipartisan group of 35 Members of the House of Representatives incallingfor conferees of the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to protect ‘Buy American' laws. Specifically, Members called for adopting Section 862 of the House bill and rejecting Section 863 of the Senate counterpart in order to require the U.S. Navy to use American made products for critical shipboard components in sealift and auxiliary ships."Jeopardizing the stability of companies—located in states across the country—that manufacture these defense components would harm our military's ability to rely on secure and stable supplies in an increasingly dynamic global security environment,"Members wrote."If domestic sources for critical defense components exit the market, our military could be forced into relying on countries that do not share our interests, including strategic adversaries like China or Russia, or countries with lax supply chain security practices, for parts and supplies.""This would unnecessarily inject risk into the defense acquisition system, ranging from counterfeit parts to uncertain lifecycle sustainment support to cybersecurity vulnerabilities,"Members continued."On the other hand, domestic content restrictions help ensure that critical products meet our military's high standards for reliability, availability, and maintainability, supporting the warfighter's safety and effectiveness."

Eroding Buy American requirements also runs counter to two Presidential initiatives—President Trump's Executive Order directing the Pentagon to strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities and his "Buy American, Hire American" Executive Order to better enforce current domestic content laws.

Excluding section 863 of the Senate-passed NDAA would maintain the existing domestic content requirements that Department of Defense components have complied with for years. Including Section 862 of the House-passed NDAA will strengthen the domestic industrial base. It is also important to note that these requirements can be waived for cost, schedule, and non-competitive reasons. In other words, Department of Defense components retain flexibility under these laws.

WASHINGTON, DC (November 2, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,released the following statement regarding the Republican tax bill, which was unveiled by Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans earlier today."Speaker Ryan and Republicans in Congress introduced a tax plan that puts billionaires first and the middle class last. Despite their claims that working Americans will see more money in their wallets, the math just doesn't add up. By eliminating critical deductions like the state and local income tax deduction and the student loan interest deduction, the Republican plan will hurt middle class families. At the same time, the GOP plan cuts taxes for massive corporations and eliminates the estate tax, providing yet another giveaway to the wealthy."None of this should come as a surprise. Speaker Ryan and Republicans in Congress have long fought for corporate and special interests, all while leaving the middle class behind. The GOP tax plan is no different. We cannot allow Speaker Ryan and President Trump to move forward with their giveaway to the wealthy and we must defeat this bill."==
Title: House Members Reintroduce Bipartisan Legislation to Make Funding Available for Rural Broadband Projects

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (November 2, 2017)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Cheri Bustos (IL-17), Jared Huffman (CA-02),Hal Rogers (KY-05), and Elise Stefanik (NY-21)today reintroduced the Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program Act, also known as the B-CROP Act. This bipartisan bill would award grant funding to rural broadband projects in high-need in combination with the current loan funding available through USDA's Rural Utilities Service. U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate earlier this year."Access to reliable, high-speed internet service is vital to communities across America, especially to small businesses and students,"said Congressman Pocan. "Yet, in rural areas, including parts of my district in Wisconsin, over a third of the population doesn't have access to quality broadband. The Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program (B-CROP) Act will increase resources to update and expand broadband infrastructure. I'm proud to work with my colleagues to help close the broadband gap so all communities can have a reliable connection.""Every aspect of our rural communities will be improved by high-speed internet access,"said Congresswoman Bustos. "You can't run a modern-day business, school, hospital or clinic with spotty and unreliable internet, and too many of our rural communities across the country are not equipped to be competitive in the digital economy. This bill is part of our plan to bring better jobs, better wages, and a better future to all Americans, and I am proud to help introduce this much-needed legislation.""Closing the digital divide in rural America and Indian country is essential to economic opportunity and public safety,"said Congressman Huffman. "We cannot continue to leave behind Americans in rural communities who need fair access to quality health care, public safety, and education services, as well as the job opportunities that the digital economy offers. I'm glad to join with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle today to rise above partisanship and introduce the Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program (B-CROP) Act, which would empower rural communities to advance broadband deployment.""Broadband is America's modern day interstate highway for business, communications and emergency response. Without it, rural parts of the country are missing out on economic diversity, educational advancements, telemedicine and much more,"said Congressman Rogers. "What's good for rural America is good for the entire country. I'm proud to join my friend, Rep. Mark Pocan, in support of the B-CROP bill to bring our smaller communities onto the global grid to explore new innovative ideas and create more jobs in the homeland."Broadband is critical infrastructure in a 21stcentury economy so that our North Country businesses can compete around the globe,"said Congresswoman Stefanik. "Broadband access is also important to ensuring our children have access to the educational resources they need to succeed. This important legislation would provide greater resources to build this 21stcentury infrastructure in the North Country and in rural areas across our nation. I am pleased to join Congressman Pocan to introduce this bipartisan legislation in the House, and I urge my colleagues to support this effort.""NTCA–The Rural Broadband Association applauds Rep. Pocan for his leadership in introducing this legislation in the U.S. House. As a founding member of the Congressional Rural Broadband Caucus, his ongoing efforts to address and overcome the challenges of deploying and sustaining broadband in rural America are greatly appreciated,"said NTCA CEO Shirley Bloomfield. "We believe the Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program (B-CROP) legislation can help promote the deployment of robust broadband networks in rural areas that are the most challenging to serve. NTCA looks forward to working with members of Congress to tackle the important issues addressed by this legislation."

The B-CROP Act proposes policies to target federal funds to rural and tribal areas in the highest of need to connect all Americans, regardless of where they live, work, or retire, to the technology necessary to succeed in the 21stcentury. Without access to high-quality, affordable broadband service, workers have fewer opportunities for good-paying jobs, farmers and business owners are isolated from new markets, children are limited in their educational opportunities and health care providers do not have reliable access to the most advanced technology available to help patients.

Specifically, the B-CROP Act does the following:

• Allows for grants of up to 50 percent of a project's cost, and up to 75 percent for remote, high-need areas, to be awarded in combination with the current loan funding available through USDA's Rural Utilities Service.
• Helps enhance the economic feasibility of projects serving rural and tribal areas.
• Gives highest priority to projects in areas that are currently unserved by high-speed broadband.
• Coordinates with the FCC's Universal Service High-Cost Support programs to complement those federal investments, responsibly spending taxpayer money.
• Increases the authorized funding for RUS's Broadband programs to $50 million per fiscal year.
• Provides adequate resources to private-sector providers — including corporations, LLCs, cooperatives or mutual organizations, state or local governments and Indian tribes or tribal organizations — to expand broadband access to unserved rural areas.
• Gives partnership projects special attention, including initiatives that leverage matching funds and that work with anchor institutions like health centers, libraries, colleges, universities and other educational entities.==

Title: Pocan Introduces End Outsourcing Act to Support American Workers
Date: October 26, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (October 26, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today introduced the End Outsourcing Act, legislation that would update the United States tax code to reward companies that invest in American workers and penalize corporations that outsource domestic jobs and factories."For too long, our tax code has incentivized companies to outsource American jobs instead of investing in workers and communities here at home,"said Pocan. "We give corporations that ship American jobs overseas a free pass while workers suffer the consequences. Rather than reward companies that relocate to other countries, we should use our tax code to incentivize firms to invest in our communities and put American workers back on the job. The End Outsourcing Act is a strong step forward in protecting American jobs, growing wages, and strengthening the middle class."

Specifically, the End Outsourcing Act:

• Prohibits companies from receiving tax breaks for outsourcing jobs and factories, and claws back tax credits and grants related to the operation and maintenance of a facility closing to relocate abroad;
• Establishes tax incentives for companies that relocate foreign jobs to rural and impoverished communities in the United States; and
• Ensures that federal contracting policy takes into consideration whether companies have outsourced domestic jobs.

The legislation has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the United Steelworkers (USW), and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).==
Title: Pocan Introduces Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act
Date: October 24, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (October 24, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today introduced the Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act, legislation that would help ensure that companies contracting with the federal government maintain safe workplaces. The legislation comes as President Trump has revoked the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, which required companies to disclose past labor law violations when bidding for large federal contracts. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate."Rather than stand up for the hardworking men and women of this nation, President Trump has decided to side with crooked contractors and corporate interests. When he revoked the Fair Pay and Workplaces Executive Order earlier this year, President Trump exposed American workers to potentially dangerous conditions that could have deadly results,"said Pocan."When the federal government grants a contract, workers should have the assurance that their work place is safe and their employer does not have a history overrun with labor law violations. The Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act would restore many protections for workers and help ensure that the U.S. government allocates federal taxpayer dollars responsibly.""Every American deserves a safe workplace, but too often, federal contractors break labor laws and endanger their employees while continuing to suck down millions of dollars in government contracts,"said Warren."This legislation will help ensure that companies that threaten the health and safety of their workers won't receive another dime from American taxpayers."

Existing regulations require that contracting officers within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) make a determination of responsibility of a prospective contractor to evaluate its "business ethics." However, the requirement is generally interpreted to relate to efficiency and costs, rather than worker safety. This bill would require contracting officers, when considering a bid for a contract worth more than $1,000,000, to:

• Consult the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's inspection database for past safety and health violations by the bidder or relevant subcontractors known to the DOD;
• Consider any violations he/she identifies as part of the bid's "responsibility determination;" and
• Refer violations to the DOD's suspension and debarment official.

The bill would also require the DOD to train contracting officials on how to evaluate safety as part of the responsibility determination. Lastly, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the DOD's procedures for evaluating contractors' safety records, the incidence of safety violations among DOD contractors, whether the Department of Labor (DOL) has the resources to investigate violations among DOD contractors, and whether the DOL should consider expanding its investigatory role into DOD contractors.

The legislation has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, Center for American Progress Action Fund, Economic Policy Institute (EPI), International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied Workers, International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC), International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (National COSH), National Employment Law Project (NELP), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the United Association of Plumbers, Pipefitters, Sprinklerfitters and Service Techs (UA).

Joining Pocan as original cosponsors of the legislation are U.S. Representatives David Cicilline (RI-01), John Conyers (MI-13), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Jim McGovern (MA-02), Jerrold Nadler (NY-10), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), Frank Pallone (NJ-06), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), and Mark Takano (CA-41).==
Title: Pocan Slams Trump for Sending Wisconsin Insurance Rate Increases Sky-High

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (October 12, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding news that Wisconsin consumers will face an average premium rate increase of36 percentfor individual insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. This rate increase is a direct result of the Trump Administration refusing to guarantee that the federal government will continue cost-sharing reduction payments.

The Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner required insurance companies to submit rates based on the assumption that the federal government will discontinue these payments, rather than make them as required by current law. As a result of President Trump's threats, in Dane County, the 2ndlowest cost silver plan will increase by an average of 60.54%, from $219.75 to $352.78."President Trump is doing everything he can to sabotage the ACA and his actions are now having a very real impact on tens of thousands of Wisconsinites. With premiums jumping 36 percent, President Trump's threats to discontinue cost-sharing reduction payments are sending the insurance markets into chaos and costing Wisconsin families hundreds of dollars every month. President Trump has never cared about working men and women, and with these rate increases, it is clearer than ever that he is actively working to hurt them. President Trump should reverse course to guarantee that his administration will continue the payments and Congress should act to make them permanent."==

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (October 4, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding news that Russian-linked Facebook ads targeted Wisconsin during the 2016 Election."Russia's interference with our national elections hit home when we found out that Russian backed interest groups bought ads in specifically targeted to Wisconsin. These ads underscore the lengths to which Russia went to meddle in our electoral process and going forward, we must work to strengthen and protect our democratic institutions from these attacks. We must also continue to support Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation to get to the bottom regarding whether or not there was collusion between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government. With the 2018 elections just over a year away, we need to know the full scope of this foreign interference and how to prevent it."We must ensure the widespread Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election never happens again. Congress should immediately bring the Securing America's Future Elections Act, legislation I introduced earlier this year, to the House Floor for a vote so that we can secure our electoral process from start to finish."

Earlier this year, Pocan introduced the Securing America's Future Elections (SAFE) Act, legislation that would safeguard U.S. elections from future foreign cyber-attacks and interference by permanently classifying the integrity and security of elections as a key component of critical infrastructure.

This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities. The SAFE Act also addresses election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines that provide paper ballots, and random audits of ballots to thwart interference.==
Title: Pocan Leads House Democrats in Rejecting the Ryan-McConnell Tax Plan

WASHINGTON, DC (October 4, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today joined members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and advocates to call on Congress to reject the Ryan-McConnell tax plan.

Republicans have finally unveiled their long-awaited tax framework, but rather than putting forward a plan for tax reform, it's another GOP multi-trillion dollar giveaway to the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class and working Americans. Democrats in Congress are standing firm in demanding real job-creating, wage-raising tax reform with not one penny in tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent and corporations who haven't paid their fair share.

Clickhereto watch the full video.

Here are the remarks, as delivered:

I want to thank everyone for joining the press conference. The Congressional Progressive Caucus—over 75 members, the largest values based caucus in the Democratic Caucus in Congress—is excited to be here, to talk about the tax bill that the Republicans are proposing. Also, Leader Pelosi should be joining us and we thank her as well for being here.

There are a lot of problems with the tax plan that the House and Senate Republicans have proposed—and the President has proposed—and while we've seen the framework, clearly a couple of things already are standing out.

One, the myth that this is somehow not going to benefit the wealthiest in this country—in reality this could be the Trump family tax plan in how it actually operates. The wealthiest, and all those people who belong to Mar-a-Lago, and all the people who are in the cabinet, are going to do quite well under this plan, because if you're wealthy, you're going to do extremely well.

The Tax Policy Center has sad that the top 1% will see half of all the benefits in 2018, and 80% of the benefits by 2027.

So Betsy DeVos is going to do quite well. Steve Mnuchin, even though he couldn't afford a plane for his honeymoon, is going to be okay under this plan, but many other people won't.

The President—if we ever saw his tax returns, we could tell you exactly how he'll do—but the New York Times has estimated that it would cut his tax bills by more than $1.1 billion.

So when the President says he won't benefit everyone else who has a calculator or can add, disagree with him. It's absurd that he's claiming he won't benefit. So the wealthiest are going to do quite well under this plan.

The other big myth is that this'll somehow help the middle class—although now we're starting to get wiggle language that they can't guarantee this will help the middle class. I think we all know what that means in Washington, right? The middle class is going to get it.

We know that the University of Chicago has said a middle class family with $50,000 in adjusted gross income—if they're a married couple with one child, they'll likely pay an additional $280 in taxes; a married couple with two children—an additional $888; three children—$1,415 in additional taxes.

And at the same time, the wealthiest one percent, again according to the Tax Policy Center said, if you're making $732,800—on average, you'll get about $129,000 in tax breaks.

So again, the wealthy benefit only from this—the middle class will pay for the wealthy to get this tax cut.

We are here to say not one penny can go to the wealthy on any tax plan that we're going to support. We will fight any tax plan that has any resemblance to what Republicans have put forward.

And I'm really glad to be joined by a lot of my colleagues and organizations that are working with us around that. The first person I would like to introduce, who has been leading a lot of our tax policy efforts within the Progressive Caucus, and that's Representative Lloyd Doggett from Texas on the Ways and Means Committee.***

So we just want to thank all of our partners—you heard from a few of them today, you met a few of the members of the Progressive Caucus.

And we're going to ensure that not one penny goes to the wealthy, not one penny goes to Donald Trump and his family, not one penny goes to the Trump cabinet, not one penny goes to the members of Mar-a-Lago, and not one penny goes to the wealthy. And we're going to fight this to the very end.

And again, thanks everyone for being here today—we really appreciate it.==

WASHINGTON, DC (October 2, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to early news reports, the shooting claimed the lives of at least 50 people, surpassing the 2016 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida and making it the deadliest mass shooting in American history."My thoughts are with the victims of this senseless tragedy, their friends and families, and the City of Las Vegas. Much like the shooting in Orlando, these innocent Americans were doing something many of us have done, attend a concert. This attack was an act of terror and no one should have to experience a tragedy like the one that unfolded in Las Vegas."Members of Congress have the power to do something and we must do more than hold a moment of silence. We said never again after the shootings in Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, and so many others. These events have become far too common and we can't stay silent when thousands of Americans die from firearms every single year."As long as Congress fails to act, it is complicit in the deaths of innocent Americans. We must take commonsense actions like reinstating the assault weapons ban, ending the sale of high-capacity magazines, and closing loopholes in the background check system. For too long, Congress has rolled over when confronted by the NRA and the gun lobby and it's time to finally take a stand. Congress must act now."==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 28, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear the caseJanus v. AFSCME Council 31."For decades, the U.S. has affirmed the rights of public sector unions, but the case before the Supreme Court is part of a continued, coordinated attack by anti-union, anti-worker special interests. Not only are workers under assault from the Trump Administration's policies, they are now about to be dealt a secondary blow by a Supreme Court that now includes Neil Gorsuch, a justice that should not be on the bench. This case is just another example of President Trump rigging the economy against workers and in favor of his wealthy friends."Every day, public sector unions empower millions of American workers to organize on behalf of living wages, safe workplaces, and a fair shot at the American Dream. These American workers are teachers and doctors, police officers and firefighters, and most importantly, friends and neighbors. The work they do each day supports every single person across the nation and we should do everything we can to support them."==

"It's a sign of love of country, a country with a promise that has to be for everyone, regardless of the color of their skin. So I join so many now, in the NFL and elsewhere, in taking a knee for the America that we all aspire for it to be."

Here are the remarks, as delivered:

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our nation has a lot of issues on its plate. We have to stabilize health care. We need an infrastructure plan that creates millions of good paying jobs. We need to deal with the hurricanes and the aftermath—not just Texas and Florida, but also Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. And we have a huge problem with North Korea and nuclear weapons. And that's just for starters.

So what did President Trump spend his weekend doing? Fixing health care for tens of millions of people? No. Lobbying for a robust job-creating infrastructure plan? No. Send aid to Puerto Rico? Mmm, not that either. De-escalate the situation in North Korea? Well actually, quite the opposite.

No, President Trump spent his weekend doing one of his favorite things—attacking Americans and various groups on his favorite medium, Twitter. His most recent attack: NFL players who use their constitutional right to freedom of speech to protest. But they're not the only ones, and the only group, being attacked.

Back in July,the New York Timesfound that President Trump was on track to insult 650 people, places, and things on Twitter by the end of his first term. Well two months later, he's certainly still at it.

Instead of attacking our nation's problems, he's attacking us. Let's take a quick look at just some of the people and groups he has attacked, both as a candidate and as president. On this board we have just a handful of the people, places, and things President Trump has insulted and if we're going to list them all, we'd probably have to have dozens of poster boards. But, here's a sampling:

• John McCain and Jeff Flake
• Barack Obama
• Hillary Clinton—even though the election happened a year ago
• The media—from the ‘failing' New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post, to individual reporters like Katy Tur and Mika Brzezinski
• Obamacare
• Hamilton—the Broadway musical
• Jeff Sessions—his own Attorney General
• The Emmys
• Nordstrom
• The Russia Investigation
• Rosie O'Donnell
• The Paris Climate Agreement
• Meryl Streep
• Mexicans
• Protestors
• Fake News
• John Oliver
• Mark Cuban
• Snoop Dogg
• And this weekend, the NFL and its players
• And the list goes on and on and on

Well, it's actually easier to name the people and things that President Trump has NOT attacked than all the ones that he has. I came up with a very small list of people or groups that he has not attacked, after several extensive Google searches.

First, I don't think the President has attacked the barber shop quartet singing organization, the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, also known as SPEBSQUA. To the best of my knowledge, he has never attacked them, so maybe he's a fan of barbershop crooners.

Although it's fairly recent: pumpkin spice lattes. I know they just came out, it's a sign of fall, but so far there's no Twitter traffic from Trump tackling these tasty treats.

And finally, these "very fine people" President Trump hasn't attacked nearly enough: the Klan, neo-Nazis, and other white supremacists.

Look, instead of being attacker-in-chief, as President, Donald Trump is supposed to unify the nation, but all he does is divide us. His job is to work for the American people, to deliver on the promises and actually help Americans. Here are the issues we need help with:

• Stabilize the Affordable Care Act to ensure tens of millions of people keep their coverage and don't just sabotage the marketplace;
• We need good paying jobs and better wages for the American people—we need a job and infrastructure plan like the President promised, but we've yet to see;
• We need trade agreements that work for American workers, again another promise we've had with no tangible results;
• And we need aid for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after last week's devastating hurricanes—much of what has yet to materialize.

Mr. President, while you tweet, you're so busy tweeting about the NFL, you attack a black man for non-violence more severely than white supremacists for violence. Look, taking a knee may have started as a protest about racial inequality, about behavior by some in law enforcement discriminating against others in this country, about unarmed people of color being killed simply for the color of their skin.

I think today, taking a knee is becoming a broader sign of patriotism and respect for our country, for a country that can be even greater for every one of its citizens. It respects the lives lost for those in this country to fight for its ideals, which includes non-violent protests. It's a sign of love of country, a country with a promise that has to be for everyone, regardless of the color of their skin.

So I join so many now, in the NFL and elsewhere, in taking a knee for the America that we all aspire for it to be.###==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 26, 2017)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)andElise Stefanik (NY-21)today called for a vote on H.R. 2482, the Perkins Loans Extension Act, after more than half of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed on as cosponsors. With the Perkins Loan program scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017, Congress must reauthorize the program, or 500,000 students across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid."With more than half of the U.S. House of Representatives supporting the Perkins Loans Extension Act, we should immediately bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Hundreds of thousands of students across the country are counting on Congress to act by September 30 to reauthorize this program or their futures will be in jeopardy,"said Pocan. "These students attend colleges and universities across the country and the Perkins Loans program gives them the opportunity to access an education they would otherwise be unable to afford. No American should ever be denied the opportunity to achieve their dreams, especially when they have worked hard and are the first in their family to attend college, as many Perkins Loans recipients are.""I want to thank my colleagues for lending their voice and their support to this important effort,"said Stefanik. "A half million students across the country will lose access to critical financial aid without action by Congress, so I'm pleased that a majority of my House colleagues have joined in support of H.R. 2482 – the Perkins Loan Extension Act. When I speak to students and families across my district, college affordability continues to be a major challenge. The Perkins Loan program is a critical tool to support low and middle income students, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to help students across the country achieve their dreams."

Pocan and Stefanik led the introduction of H.R. 2482, the Perkins Loan Extension Act, which extends the Perkins Loan Program for a period of 2 years so that students currently enrolled in the program can continue to receive financial aid. The legislation currently has 223 cosponsors in the House of Representatives and is supported by more than 30 education based organizations and more than 80 universities. Companion legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Rob Portman (R-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Susan Collins (R-ME).==
Title: Pocan, Moore, Kind Demand Answers: Will Walker Protect Wisconsinites with Pre-Existing Conditions?

WASHINGTON, DC (September 25, 2017)–U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Gwen Moore (WI-04),andRon Kind (WI-03)todaywroteto Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, asking him whether or not he would allow health insurers to discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions, effectively blocking their access to affordable coverage.

Under the latest version of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill, states like Wisconsin could allow insurers to charge patients with pre-existing conditions premiums so high that health insurance would be out of reach for many. Additionally, states would be allowed to determine whether insurance plans sold in the state must provide coverage for services that are considered essential health benefits—services like prescription drug coverage, maternity care, substance abuse treatment, and hospitalization."Earlier this year, youfailed to provideclarity on whether or not you will continue provisions enacted under the ACA which prohibit discriminating against individuals with pre-existing conditions,"Pocan, Moore, and Kind wrote. "Given the prospects that this legislation may move forward, we request you provide answers to whether you intend to maintain the requirement that insurance companies provide equal coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions and whether you will ensure that Wisconsinites will continue to have access to essential health benefits."

Specifically, Pocan, Moore, and Kind asked Walker to answer the following questions:

1. Will you unequivocally refuse to allow health insurance companies to discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions by guaranteeing they are not unfairly priced out of the market?
2. Will you guarantee that essential health benefits—including benefits that currently exist, such as prescription drug coverage, maternity care, and emergency services—are covered for Wisconsinites?
3. Under this bill, people with pre-existing conditions may have to pay more for their coverage. If this legislation is signed into law, will you commit to proposing changes to the Wisconsin legislature to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions do not pay more for their care?

WASHINGTON, DC (September 20, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today released the following statement regarding graffiti that was painted on a memorial near the Gates of Heaven Synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin. The graffiti included swastikas and a pro-Trump message."The anti-Semitic vandalism outside the Gates of Heaven Synagogue is a shameful display of hate that has no place in our community. As we approach Rosh Hashanah, our friends in the Jewish community should feel welcomed, not threatened. However, the President's embrace of white supremacists and hate groups has emboldened extremists to unleash a new wave of anti-Semitic and intimidating activities. We must stand united against these acts of hate and reaffirm the values that we share as Americans—that our nation will always be a land of opportunity and hope for people of every faith and ethnicity."==

WASHINGTON, DC (September 20, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)this week joined members of the Wisconsin Congressional Delegation in calling on the U.S. Departments of State, Transportation, and Commerce to enforce the Open Skies agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Enforcing these agreements is critical to protecting the jobs of more than 1,000 U.S. airline employees in Wisconsin and thousands more across the country."Since 1992, the United States has entered into Open Skies agreements with 120 countries. These bilateral aviation trade agreements allow for market principles rather than government regulation to provide access to destinations at home and abroad and are premised on fair and equal competition,"wrote the Members. "The Open Skies policy has been a success, with two notable exceptions – Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. These countries have provided more than $50 billion in subsidies to their state-owned airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates Airline, and Etihad Airways. These subsidies undermine the principle behind the Open Skies policy by creating market distortions and hamper the ability of U.S. airlines and their workers to compete.""Every long-haul international route lost to the subsidized Gulf carriers costs more than 1,500 American jobs and jeopardizes service to markets throughout the country, including in Wisconsin,"continued the Members. "We cannot afford to continue to allow these subsidies to harm American workers. We respectfully ask that you enforce the Open Skies agreements with Qatar and the UAE and ensure that there is a fair and equal opportunity for U.S. airlines and aviation workers to compete."

WASHINGTON, DC (September 13, 2017)–U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02)today joined House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-NY) and Vice Chair Linda Sánchez (D-CA) to launch theJobs for America Task Forces, a unified effort from the House Democratic Caucus to craft a real legislative agenda that will benefit hardworking Americans and middle-class families.

Pocan is the Co-Chair of the Access to Jobs Task Force, one of five Democratic Caucus Jobs for America Task Forces aimed at identifying opportunities and solutions for American workers. The Access to Jobs Task Force will help workers achieve their full potential by expanding access to capital, encouraging entrepreneurship and small business ownership, increasing educational opportunities – including vocational skills development, professional licensing, and apprenticeship training – and eliminating senseless and outdated social barriers to work that affect many communities.

Here are the remarks, as delivered:

Thank you, Julia, and thanks to Joe and Linda for putting this together—and all my other colleagues for being here. When you hear us talk about better jobs, better wages, and a better future, let me try to put it another way coming from America's heartland, from Wisconsin.

It's really what people talk about at their kitchen tables—can they afford their mortgage or rent, can they have health care for their family, can they take a family vacation, can they send their kids to college if they want to go. That's what people actually talk about.

Just contrast that with what we're doing right now in Congress. We've spent the first eight months trying to take away health care from 20 million people, we want to now cut taxes for the wealthiest in this country, and some people are willing to shut down government over a wall.

Well, I can tell you in Paul Ryan's district, which is the neighboring district to mine, if the wall means you're keeping employers in, they might support that, but 25,000 people used to make cars in the 1stCongressional District, in Paul Ryan's district—no one does today.

The subcommittee that I'm on, along with Ami Bera, Marc Veasey, and Lisa Blunt Rochester, is to talk specifically about access to jobs, what we can do to help do that—that covers everything from higher education, apprenticeships, access to capital, entrepreneurship.

Those are the goals that we have with this committee, and we are up to the task and look forward to making sure that our caucus continues to focus on what's most important to people across the country, and that's talking about jobs and wages, something the Republicans simply aren't doing.

And it is my honor to introduce, I believe the word is spectacular I am supposed to use, Representative from Pennsylvania, Brendan Boyle.==

WASHINGTON, DC (August 25, 2017)– In response to President Trump'ssigningof an executive order that imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela today,U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), John Conyers, Jr. (MI-13),andRo Khanna (CA-17)released the following statement and reiterated their call for a diplomatic solution to Venezuela's political and economic crisis."With its announcement of the most extensive U.S. financial sanctions against Venezuela to date, the Trump Administration is once again pursuing aggressive unilateral measures abroad in an attempt to distract attention away from the sustained outrage over the president'sdisgracefulanticsat home–all while designing his sanctions in accordance with the interests of oil-industry lobbyists."While we remain deeply concerned over President Maduro's efforts to supersede Venezuela's duly elected National Assembly, these unilateral sanctions will only further complicate efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the country's political crisis and threaten to create greater economic hardship for ordinary Venezuelans. As we and other progressive lawmakersnotedlast month in a letter to Secretary Tillerson, U.S. economic sanctions are overwhelmingly rejected by Venezuelans and only undermine dialogue by strengthening the hand of hardliners on both sides of the political divide while weakening the voices of moderation. By applying financial sanctions to Venezuela, President Trump is threatening the country's ability to access foreign currency, which is desperately needed to alleviate widespread shortages of food, medicine and basic goods."Prior to ratcheting up hostilities through these latest sanctions, President Trump absurdlysuggesteda ‘military option' in Venezuela, publicly betraying his campaign promise to avoid regime-change efforts that have undermined U.S. security interests. Such a reckless maneuver, absent Congressional authorization and UN Security Council approval, would be clearly unconstitutional and illegal. A sensible approach to Venezuela's crisis is obvious: the United States needs to work with other governments in the region to support mediation and negotiations that involve respected international actors such as the Vatican and the United Nations."###==

Pocan posted fact checks to his Twitter page@RepMarkPocanthroughout the event."Hopefully the media event that occurred tonight will convince Paul Ryan that talking to his constituents is a good idea,"said Pocan. "In the remaining weeks when Paul is home, he might want to schedule a real town hall or two and explain his health care bill that drops tens of millions of people's coverage, as well as discuss his tax preferences that would give the top 1% more tax breaks while working Americans continue to struggle. I'd be glad to go with him to a real town hall if that helps give him the courage."

Speaker Ryan has not held a public, open town hall in Wisconsin's 1stCongressional District since October 2015.

Title: Members of Congress Urge Trump to Stand with Americans against Nissan’s Anti-Worker Campaign
Date: August 1, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC (August 1, 2017)– In advance of a closely watched vote to unionize a Nissan Motor Co. manufacturing plant this Thursday and Friday in Canton, Mississippi, 18 members of Congress sent President Trump asharply worded letterthis week, urging him to publicly support the collective bargaining rights of the Mississippi auto workers and asking that he demand that Nissan "shift its posture towards the organizing drive at the facility in Canton to neutral."

The Nissan factory—partly owned by Japanese and French investors, including the French government—is one of the company's only plants throughout the world without a union or any meaningful worker representation. The U.S. Representatives note that working conditions at the factory have been plagued with threats against employees and "hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm."

According topress reports, workers have been compelled to attend large group meetings on the dangers of unions and endure warnings from supervisors of a potential plant closure and lower incomes, leading the National Labor Relations Board tochargethe company with violating workers' rights."On the campaign trail, candidate Trump denounced the way that foreign companies take advantage of an economic system that's rigged against ordinary workers," saidRep.Mark Pocan (WI-02). "The fight in Canton is the clearest example of this. Unlike any other Nissan employees in the rest of the industrialized world, American workers have been forced to swallow relentless anti-union propaganda from Nissan managers in the days and weeks leading up to this vote. Such intimidation must stop. President Trump came to power promising people good jobs. Now is his chance to truly stand up to a foreign company bullying Americans into accepting lower wages and unsafe working conditions.""The right to collective bargaining is one of the most fundamental rights of working Americans,"said Rep. Debbie Dingell (MI-12). "If President Trump is serious about standing up for the working men and women of this country, he should be willing to support efforts that ensure all Americans have the right to collectively bargain to improve their jobs and quality of life."

What President Trump has done today is tell more than a million Americans that they are not equal or valued. While he may cite ‘tremendous medical costs and disruption' as the basis for this decision, this claim has been disproven. In reality, his decision is based in discrimination and an effort to reverse progress made under the Obama Administration."Since the first days of his campaign, President Trump has denigrated and disrespected the LGBT community. Transgender Americans deserve respect and the opportunity to serve our nation in the military. With more than 15,000 transgender Americans serving in the military today, President Trump should immediately reverse course on his decision and he should stop using shocking policy shifts on Twitter to distract Americans from his failing health care plan."==

Clickhereto watch the full video.

Here are the remarks, as delivered:

Thank you, Annie. I'm here to represent the Progressive Caucus—Raúl Grijalva and I are co-chairs—that caucus is the largest values based caucus within our (Democratic) caucus, mid 70s in members.

We have always said that the core economic issues are at the center of everything that we need to talk about, what people talk about at their kitchen table—whether or not they can afford their mortgage, have health insurance for their family, send their kids to college if they want to, or take a family vacation.

Those are the core issues, and if we are going to talk to people about anything else that we care about—and there are many things we care about—we have to be centered around better jobs, better wages, and better a future.

So we are glad to share these values with all the different caucuses within the Democratic Caucus. We are all on the same page, and if you look at the Republican Party, not only are they not on the same page, but they're not reading out of the same book, and whatever books they're reading from aren't even in the same language.

So, we are glad to all be here, united around this core economic message that's so very important, and the Progressive Caucus is glad to work with everyone else in advancing these principles as we move forward. And it's my pleasure to introduce someone from my class, who is representing the New Dems, Scott Peters from San Diego, California.

Here is Rep. Pocan's response to a question on apprenticeships:

If I can just add real quick, I've been a small-business owner for nearly three decades, and one of the issues that we had up in Appropriations, which I serve on, last week is they also gutted every single dime of money for apprenticeship grants.

One of our focuses is on apprenticeships, and we had the previous question, I think last week or two weeks ago, on a bill that I have called the LEARNS Act, where we are trying to expand apprenticeships and go beyond a traditional just building trades model into healthcare and IT and a lot of other areas.

So apprenticeships are a way to give people the training and the skills that they need to get the jobs that are out there, and we are very focused on it. In contrast, Republicans are literally gutting every single dime, not just President Trump's budget, but the Congressional Republicans as well.==

"With Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach at the helm of this Commission – the architect of several restrictive voter suppression initiatives against communities of color for which he was sued by the A.C.L.U. on four separate occasions – I fear our country will once again see an influx of discriminatory policies reminiscent of the ‘grandfather clauses' of the Jim Crow era. I simply cannot endorse the release of sensitive voter information to a Commission led by a man whose connections to organizations deemed ‘hate groups' by the Southern Poverty Law Center reach back over a decade.""More than 8 months after the 2016 election, President Trump still cannot comprehend how he lost the popular vote to Secretary Clinton. Despite his place in the White House, he is still clinging to the false claim that there was widespread voter fraud and his sham President Commission on Election Integrity only serves to perpetuate that myth,"said Pocan. "President Trump's sham commission will be used as a tool of discrimination and voter suppression, not as a way to strengthen and secure our electoral process. Wisconsin should join states across the country in rejecting President Trump's demands to turn over data. Our voters deserve it.""It is absolutely outrageous that in 2017 we still have politicians who are trying to make it harder for Wisconsinites to vote,"said Kind. "I urge the Wisconsin Elections Commission, in the strongest terms possible, to refuse requests by the Trump Administration to turn over Wisconsinites' private information.""Never before has the personal voting data of so many—over 200 million Americans—been compiled and stored in one source,"the Members of Congress wrote. "The collection of this information by the Commission creates an undue risk to the privacy rights of Wisconsin voters. While we note that your current position on this matter is to supply the Commission with publically accessible data and to charge a fee for the remaining information, we caution that your decision to even partially cooperate with this inquest exposes the Wisconsin electorate to significant, irreparable harm, especially in light of allegations of extensive efforts by Russia and others to interfere in our democracy. A price should not be placed on the privacy of our constituents."

The Lee Amendment would have prohibited any federal funding for implementation of the Muslim ban. The Pocan Amendment would have expanded the list of bona fide relationships under the Trump Administration's Muslim ban to include all familial relationships, including grandparents and grandchildren."The families affected by the Muslim ban are fleeing unthinkable violence, and to further exacerbate the situation by breaking up grandchildren and grandparents is shameful. President Trump's divisive and arbitrary executive order devalues familial relationships and makes it extremely difficult for families to reconnect and stay together,"said Pocan. "While the Muslim ban wages war on a core American value of freedom from persecution and discrimination, Congress had the chance to help settle one of the most disturbing aspects of the executive order. The amendment I offered in committee had the power to stop the practices of breaking up families and I am disappointed that it failed.""Our nation is, has been and will always be a nation of immigrants. Closing our doors to refugees and Muslims is un-American and unconstitutional. We simply cannot afford to let the Trump Administration implement an executive order that would undermine our democracy, weaken our leadership on the world stage and place national security at risk,"said Lee. "Today I was proud to offer an amendment that would prohibit funds from implementing, administering, or enforcing President Trump's heartless Muslim ban. This is not who we are."==

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, today introduced theVoter Roll Integrity Act, H.R. 3091 which strengthens voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters through a system called Interstate Cross Check.

According a 2016 NBCreport, an analysis of nearly 50 million registered voters from 12 different states demonstrated that over 7 million people were removed from the voting rolls, potentially without a comprehensive confirmation from the voter in question. These purges disproportionately impact young people, minorities, and low-incomevoters."Kicking legally-registered voters off the voting rolls stifles democracy and creates an unnecessary burden for voters who find that they have been mistakenly and unfairly removed from the rolls,"said Rep. Pocan. "This is a problem affecting more than 7 million people across the country and I've heard from many of my constituents about this Interstate Cross Check. The Voter Roll Integrity Act will help ensure states cannot infringe upon an individual's right to vote.""Access to the ballot box is critical to a fair and functioning democracy, and Congress must ensure that no state is actively wiping eligible Americans from voter rolls,"said Lisa Gilbert, Vice President of Legislative Affairs at Public Citizen. "At a time when politicians rely on huge donors to get and remain in power, our last line of defense against a corporate takeover of our government is the American people. The Voter Roll Integrity Act is an important step towards ensuring that all Americans, particularly young people, people of color, and low-income voters are not blocked by states from raising their voices in our democracy."

TheVoter Roll Integrity Actwould require that states:

1. May only remove a voter from the rolls if they have independently confirmed her or hisfull name, including middle name; date of birth; last 4 digits of social security number; and suffix.
2. Request a response from voters to confirm a change of address

Additionally, the analysisconcludedthat exchange enrollees would see health care cost and premium increases of $2,334 on average and $5,574 for those people between the ages of 60-64 in our state."This bill is bad for Wisconsin. People are going to pay higher costs for less coverage, insurers will be allowed to charge seniors up to 5 times more for coverage, and 394,100 Wisconsinites are going to lose coverage all together. This bill is going to cause real pain for millions of people because Republicans want to give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest, insurance companies and big corporations, rather than help their constituents who need access to health care."Senator Ron Johnson said the Senate should not rush this bill through and had reservations about the process. I agree. Other Republicans should take note of what Senator Susan Collins said and work with Democrats to help make our health care system better. The answer is not pulling the rug out from under 22 million Americans, so the rich can get richer."###==
Title: Pocan, Kaptur introduce bill to protect consumers from rising prescription drug prices

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. –Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) introduced legislation that would hold drug manufacturers accountable for spiking the price of prescription drugs; theStop Price Gouging Act, H.R. 2974,uniquely protects consumers and penalizes drug corporations that spike drug prices deliberately without justification. Earlier this month Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced a Senate version of the bill."In the last year, 28 million Americans saw a price spike for the drugs they take and 4 million of them had to stop taking their prescription because drug manufacturer raised the price so high they could no longer afford the medicine,"said Congressman Pocan."This legislation is crucially needed to protect Americans from drug manufacturers making an excessive profit off of Americans need for life-saving medications. The Stop Price Gouging Act holds drug manufacturers responsible and is the first bill that truly protects American consumers from the increasing cost of prescription drugs.""We need to stand up to drug companies that are more worried about bolstering profits for their Wall Street investors, than making sure people can afford life-saving medication,"said Congresswoman Kaptur. "Thank you, Congressman Pocan for leading with me in the House to shine some sunlight on drug companies' shady price gouging. The predatory pricing practicing of giant, largely faceless, corporations must get the sunlight they deserve. The well-being of millions of America depends on it."

About the bill:

TheStop Price Gouging Actholds pharmaceutical companies accountable and protects consumers from egregious year-after-year price spikes and large, unjustified single price spikes companies use when they reach the end of their patent life or are looking for a quick increase in revenue. In recent years, America has witnessed a rapid increase in prescription drug costs. Between 2010 and 2014, thirty common pharmaceuticals experienced an average price increase of approximately 76 percent. These massive price increases have had an inordinate impact on the elderly and most seniors cannot absorb the price shock of rapidly rising drug prices. This situation has left Medicare and in turn taxpayers on the hook.

Specifically, the bill does the following:

• Requires pharmaceutical corporations to report any increases in the price of their products, as well as justification for any increases that exceed medical inflation, to the public.
• Imposes a penalty on corporations that engage in excessive, unjustified price increases that is proportional to the size of the price spike.
• Instructs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study examining how drug manufacturers establish initial launch prices and suggest best practices for monitoring new drug pricing; and
• Reinvests revenues collected from companies will be invested in future drug research and development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

House bill is endorsed by Public Citizen, Social Security Works, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Daily Kos, Families USA, Knowledge Ecology International, and Universities Allied for Essential Medicines

Title: Rep. Pocan Statement on Senate’s Trumpcare Plan
Date: June 22, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Appropriations Committee's Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, released the following statement after Senate Republican Leadership finally unveiled its version of Trumpcare."The Senate Republican plan is almost a mirror image of the House-passed Trumpcare bill which President Trump referred to as ‘mean' and ‘cold-hearted.' Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should also know this bill is mean to people. It will take away critical ACA protections and essential health benefits like cancer screenings and maternity coverage, so he's trying to push it through the Senate without any public hearings or debate. It doesn't matter if it's the Senate or House version of Trumpcare, it's still going to take away health care for millions. Look, if you're in a river and you see a pair of jaws coming at you, it doesn't matter if it's a crocodile or an alligator – it's still going to get you."Plain and simple, this bill is a broken promise to the American people. If Republicans were truly proud of the bill they are offering the American people, they would not have hidden the bill for months only to try and jam the bill through the Senate at the last minute in hopes that constituents won't notice."Even Senator Ron Johnson is having reservations about the process and timing of this so-called health care bill, which should convince anyone on the fence that this is not a good bill. Senate Republicans are right to be ashamed of their bill which strips coverage from millions of Americans while providing massive tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires."###==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Appropriations Committee's Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, released the following statement after Anthem announced it will reduce individual health care plan offerings in Wisconsin next year."You can trace Anthem's decision to the instability President Trump and Republicans in Congress have injected into the health care marketplace. Instead of working with Democrats to fix some of the issues with the Affordable Care Act, Trump has decided to do everything in his power to create a volatile environment for health care plan providers and allow millions of people to potentially lose coverage. The American people want their elected officials to be open and transparent about health care legislation pending Congressional consideration and want us to work together to make health care affordable and accessible. Republicans in Congress have made it clear their priority is to give tax cuts for the wealthy, while taking away coverage for millions of Americans."###==
Title: Rep. Pocan Introduces Legislation to Strengthen Apprenticeship Programs and Increase the Number of Highly Skilled Workers in U.S.
Date: June 21, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Appropriations Committee's Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, introduced the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act. The LEARNS Act would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and strengthens apprenticeship programs as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers."Wisconsin, home to the first state law establishing an apprenticeship program, has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the registered apprenticeship model over the last 100 years,"said Representative Mark Pocan. "The LEARNS Act seeks to build on the success of such programs by strengthening apprenticeship programs and helping prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. These apprenticeship programs are particularly effective when labor and management both have a seat at the table in developing the standards and curriculum, which is why I am proud to introduce this legislation with so many labor partners. The LEARNS Act is another commonsense step Congress can take to ensure workers are able to secure good-paying, family-supporting jobs.""I thank Rep. Pocan for introducing the LEARNS Act to help close the skills gap and ensure American workers can compete for good jobs,"said Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (MD). "Rep. Pocan has been a strong advocate for working families, and I hope we can advance this legislation so that more of our people have the skills to find well-paying jobs and make it in America.""Registered apprenticeship programs offer on-the-job training and skills development that result in a nationally-recognized credential,"said Education and the Workforce Ranking Member, Bobby Scott (VA-03). "They not only empower workers to earn while they learn, but also provide them with knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in our nation's high growth industries. The Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act will provide the resources needed to ensure that these proven job training programs are accessible to employers and workers alike. Registered apprenticeships are one of the most direct pathways to good jobs and the LEARNS Act will extend the benefits of these programs to more Americans.""Apprenticeships are an essential tool in expanding economic opportunity to millions of American workers, as well as growing and strengthening the middle class,"said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Ranking Member on the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for funding the Department of Labor. "While President Trump's budget makes disastrous cuts to our nation's apprenticeship programs, the LEARNS Act would invest in these programs and ensure that apprenticeships are giving more workers the skills and tools they need to succeed. I am proud to join Rep. Pocan in cosponsoring this legislation and I strongly encourage my colleagues to Congress to support it.""The men and women of the IUPAT thank Rep. Pocan for his ongoing fight for working families, and for his leadership in introducing the LEARNS Act,"Kenneth Rigmaiden, General President – IUPAT. "With well over 100 years' experience in building our great nation, the skilled crafts men and women of the Building Trades know that an apprenticeship is the gateway to a safe and successful career, with a solid foothold in the middle class. The passage of the LEARNS Act will ensure that the American workforce will learn the necessary and portable skills to meet the specific demands of employers and entire industries through qualified apprenticeship programs."

The LEARNS Act will:

• Support closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, employers and other program sponsors offering good jobs,
• Increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by program participants,
• Create national standards for registered apprenticeship programs, and
• Establish a permanent advisory council at the Department of Labor to oversee the actions and implementation of registered apprenticeship programs.

The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-VA), Rosa L. DeLauro (D-CT), John Conyers (D-MI), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Ron Kind (D-WI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Katherine Clark (D-MA), Susan Davis (D-CA), Kildee (D-MI), Mark Takano (D-CA), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Pete Visclosky (D-IN).

The legislation is also supported by a variety of business, labor, education, and advocacy groups, including: North America's Building Trades (NABTU), International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA), AFL-CIO, the National Skills Coalition and Young Invincibles.###==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement after this morning's shooting, which injured 5 individuals including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, current and former House staffers, and several Capitol Police officers:"Today, I'm thinking of the victims of this senseless act of violence, including my colleague Rep. Steve Scalise, current and former staffers, and Capitol Police officers. I want to thank the Capitol Police officers and first responders for putting their lives on the line to prevent further injuries. These horrifying incidents have become far too commonplace and have absolutely no place in our society. Sadly, almost a year to the day of the Pulse massacre, we have yet another reminder of how prevalent gun violence is in our communities. As Congress holds another moment of silence today, I hope we will have a moment of action after it."###==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), released the following statement after former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on President Trump and the Russia investigation:"Based on what Comey said during his testimony today, there is every indication that President Trump blatantly lied to the American people. This should be of grave concern to everyone, regardless of political party. We've known for a while that the President has changed his story multiple times, but Comey laid bare the extent to which Trump will lie to try and justify his impulsive decisions and irresponsible actions. My conclusion from this testimony is that we desperately need an independent commission now to get to the truth about the Trump Administration's ties to Russia period."###==

Title: Rep. Mark Pocan Elected New Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus
Date: May 23, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) was elected today by his colleagues as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC). He assumes the Co-Chair position vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison (MN-05), who is now the Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)."With the Trump Administration attacking both the values we hold dear and the programs which provide vital services to people across the country, it is my goal to help make the Congressional Progressive Caucus the voice of the resistance,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."All we need to do is take a look at the devastating cuts proposed in the budget President Trump released today to see the clear distinction between progressives and this Administration and Congress. I am proud to help lead the charge in Congress for progressive ideas that lay the foundation for our resistance in this era of Trump. The CPC will fight the fights against bad policies and offer positive alternatives which demonstrate progressives have a pulse on the will of the people and a plan forward.""As a lifelong progressive, I will continue to fight for the kitchen table issues we all care about and put forward pragmatic, progressive policies to combat Donald Trump and Paul Ryan's radical agenda,"continued Rep. Pocan. "House Republicans think they can get away with passing a health care bill that will cause 24 million Americans to lose coverage, but the CPC will work with outside groups to ensure people understand what Congress is doing. We know progressives have a winning message across the country and in America's heartland. I hope to help the Congressional Progressive Congress make sure the voices of the American people are heard in the halls of Congress.""As an outgoing Co-Chair of the Caucus, I know the dedication and determination it takes to be a leader in the CPC,"Rep. Keith Ellison said."Congressman Mark Pocan has these qualities in abundance. He has been an active member of the CPC during his two terms in Congress and has been an outstanding First Vice-Chair of the CPC.""It's been a privilege serving the CPC and I look forward to working with Mark as Co-Chair to advance the caucus' agenda of standing up for working people,"Rep. Ellison continued."I would like to give my sincere thanks to Congressman Ellison for his steadfast leadership and friendship these past several years as Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,"CPC Co-Chair Rep. Raúl Grijalva said."The energy, time and dedication he showed for the CPC has been instrumental in growing the progressive movement. I know that I share the sentiment of the entire caucus when I say that Congressman Ellison will continue to be a principal and principled leader and voice for progressive values.""I would like to congratulate Congressman Pocan and welcome him as our new Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Congressman Pocan's commitment and leadership is especially crucial during these times,"continued Rep. Grijalva. "I look forward to working with him to amplify the message and values of our Caucus and standing up for the millions of hard-working Americans we represent."###

The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is the largest caucus within the House Democratic Caucus, with over 70 members standing up for progressive ideals in Washington and throughout the country. Since 1991, the CPC has advocated for progressive policies that prioritize working Americans over corporate interests, fight economic and social inequality, and promote civil liberties. The CPC champions progressive policy solutions like comprehensive immigration reform, a $15 national minimum wage, fair trade, gun violence reform, debt-free college, and making the federal government a Model Employer.==
Title: Bipartisan Group Introduces Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2017
Date: May 17, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.– Today, Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21), Mark Pocan (D-WI-02) Louise Slaughter (D-NY-25), John Duncan (R-TN-02), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA-11) introduced thePerkins Loan Extension Act of 2017– bipartisan legislation to extend the Perkins Loan Program for a period of two years. The Federal Perkins Loan is a popular and effective campus-based financial aid program, which supports access to higher education by providing low interest loans to students in need."The Perkins Loan program helps students struggling to find a way to pay for college in Wisconsin and all across the country,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Providing a two year extension of the program is a commonsense step towards ensuring access to this vital tool for making college more affordable. Without Perkins, many students and families would be left with few options to cover college expenses. Two years ago we passed a bipartisan extension of Perkins and I will continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues to make sure it happens again this year.""Perkins Loans are an important resource for low income families in my district who are pursuing their higher education dreams,"said Congresswoman Stefanik. "As the first Member of my immediate family to graduate from college, I know how critical a college degree is to succeeding in a 21st century economy. We must ensure that low income students have access to a quality education, and the Perkins Loan program is a critical tool to help them succeed. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.""A number of students in my District rely on the Perkins Loan Program, so we need to extend the program for another two years,"said Rep. John Duncan. "I believe the entire federal student loan system needs to be revamped and made more efficient, cost-effective, and helpful for our students. But in the meantime, we need to extend the Perkins Loan program for these students while Congress determines how best to improve federal student loans.""Perkins loans help low-income students access the benefits of a higher education,"said Rep. Louise Slaughter. "This program provides low-interest loans that are paid back to the student's college, creating a revolving system that supports the next class of deserving students. With no additional funding from the federal government, Perkins loans will continue to help low-income students attain an education and allow them to break the cycle of poverty. It is inexcusable that some politicians are targeting this program for elimination since without Perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country—nearly 50,000 from New York State and over 6,000 from my district alone—would not have access to a critical safety net.""The state of California is the second highest recipient of Perkins loans, which help students focus on their studies rather than how they will afford college. By improving affordability of higher education today, we are strengthening the workforce of tomorrow. I am proud to join colleagues from both sides of the aisle to introduce the Perkins Loan Extension Act to help students continue to receive the assistance they need and deserve,"said Congressman Mark DeSaulnier."As a former Florida certified teacher, I've been committed to helping students and prospective students achieve their educational goals,"said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. "For years, Perkins Loans have empowered many students in South Florida to realize their dream of a college education, and equipped them with the knowledge and tools to have successful professional lives. It is an honor to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to ensure that these loans remain available to low income students. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the speedy extension of these important loans."

Absent Congressional action, the Perkins Loan program will expire at the end of September leaving around 500,000 students without access to important financial aid.

Perkins Loans borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. Unlike many other student loan programs, Perkins is administered directly by colleges and universities who originate the loans, counsel their students through repayment, and select contractors for servicing and collection.

Colleges and Universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers' and institutions' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program with institutions contributing one-third of their students' awards. This "ownership interest" also contributes to the successful management of this vital program.-67% of Perkins borrowers are dependent students, 34% of whom are from families with household incomes of less than $30,000.-20% of Perkins borrowers are independent students, 70% of whom have personal incomes of less than $20,000.

The Perkins Loan program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017if Congress does not act to reauthorize this program. If the Perkins Loan is eliminated, around 500,000 students across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid.

What They're Saying:"These lawmakers are to be commended for their commitment to extending the Federal Perkins Loan Program and providing higher education access to students who would otherwise be unable to attend or complete college. Each year, more than 500,000 students nationwide rely on low-cost Perkins loans to help finance their education. The Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations (COHEAO) is proud to support these champions in their efforts to extend this long-standing and proven program and we encourage Congress to pass this legislation immediately so that critical funding decisions can be made for these students now."Maria Livolsi, COHEAO President

"The State University of New York proudly supports the Perkins Loan Extension Act, which would ensure continued financial aid for more than 14,000 of our own students and hundreds of thousands more across the country,"said SUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher. "Thank you to Congresswoman Stefanik, who has always served as a champion of public higher education and the students who attend our colleges and universities."

Title: Rep. Pocan, 50 Members Urge Santander Bank to Remain Neutral as Workers Seek Possible Union Representation
Date: May 5, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) led aletterwith 50 Members of Congress urging Santander Holding USA CEO Scott Powell to remain neutral as their employees decide whether they want union representation. Banco Santander already has 150,000 unionized workers throughout Europe and South America.

In the letter, the Members write: "We were disappointed to hear that, to date, Santander's U.S. management has not responded to the workers' requests and has continued to discourage employees from participating in union activities, even on their own time. We hope the company's unwillingness to have a conversation with its employees about neutrality is not a harbinger of management's opposition to their unionizing efforts."

The text of the letter is below and an electronic copy can be foundhere.

Dear Mr. Powell:

We write to urge you to respect the rights of Santander Holdings USA (Santander) U.S. employees to choose whether they want union representation by staying neutral in the U.S. workers' organizing efforts. Banco Santander's 150,000 unionized workers throughout Europe and South America have benefitted from union representation, and the nearly 10,000 U.S. workers deserve the opportunity to choose without pressure from Santander management whether collective bargaining is right for them.

We understand that workers at Santander locations in the U.S., with the support of thousands of workers in eight countries, recently attempted to meet with management to ask the company to stay neutral in the U.S. workers' organizing efforts. We were disappointed to hear that, to date, Santander's U.S. management has not responded to the workers' requests and has continued to discourage employees from participating in union activities, even on their own time. We hope the company's unwillingness to have a conversation with its employees about neutrality is not a harbinger of management's opposition to their unionizing efforts.

In fact, allowing Santander employees to organize, should they choose to do so, could ultimately prove beneficial to Santander U.S. A number of recent violations, ranging from illegal overdraft fees to unlawful repossessions of military servicemembers' vehicles, could ostensibly have been forestalled or prevented if employees operated under the protections provided by a union. Consider, too, the recent report by the Committee for Better Banks that sheds light on potential discriminatory lending practices, and whether a bank with a stronger relationship between management and employees would be better able to address these alleged violations and prevent future regulatory problems.

Banco Santander's global workforce has helped it grow from a regional institution to one of the world's 10 largest banks. In particular, it has implemented agreements in the countries where its workforce is unionized that have helped it to avoid certain abuses that have become more prevalent among U.S. banks. Santander's U.S. employees deserve the same opportunity to form a union if they choose, and we urge you to stay neutral in those organizing efforts.# # #==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after House Republicans passed Trumpcare by a vote of 217 to 213."This so-called health care plan is a disaster. The reality is that under Trumpcare, 24 million Americans could lose their health insurance and it will likely remove protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Older Americans are going to pay up to 5 times more than others for their health care. On top of that is $600 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest in this country, insurance companies, and Big Pharma. That's what the Republicans in Congress and President Trump are all about. Those are their priorities. Unfortunately, the American people did not make that list."# # #==

Mark Pocan (D-WI), Justin Amash (R-MI), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), John Conyers (D-MI), Jim McGovern (D-MA) and 10 other members of Congress sent abipartisan letterto Defense Secretary James Mattis urgently calling on him to brief Congress at his "earliest opportunity" before the U.S. approves or assists a potentially catastrophic military action by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

Secretary Mattis was reported to have proposed U.S. military support for a Saudi-led assault on the Yemeni port of Hodeida, through which the vast majority of food shipments must pass before reaching millions of Yemenis on the brink of famine. Aid agencies, experts, and the United Nations have warned that a U.S.-backed Saudi operation could trigger mass starvation in a country ravaged by the two-year-old war and Saudi-imposed blockade."In the face of Yemen's senseless humanitarian tragedy,"write the Members of Congress, "we are committed to using our Constitutional authority to assert greater oversight over U.S. involvement in the conflict and promote greater public debate regarding U.S. military participation in Yemen's civil war, which has never been authorized by Congress." They conclude: "Should the administration remain unresponsive to our repeated inquiries into the nature of U.S. engagement in a potentially catastrophic Saudi attack on Hodeida, we will pursue legislation to explicitly prohibit U.S. involvement in any such an assault."

Last month, in abipartisan request, Rep. Pocan and 54 of his colleagues asked President Trump a simple question: what legal justification is the White House claiming for escalating U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen—a war that's never been authorized by Congress?

The letter to Secretary Mattis was signed by U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Justin Amash (R-MI), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), John Conyers (D-MI), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HA), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Peter A.

Dear Secretary Mattis:

We write to applaud your public comments, made on April 18th, indicating your intent to put the two-year-old, U.S.-backed Saudi war in Yemen "in front of a UN-brokered negotiating team and try to resolve this politically as soon as possible." We were encouraged by your resolve, en route to Saudi Arabia, to "work with our allies" to have the crisis "brought to an end" in light of "the number of innocent people dying inside Yemen."

Yet one week after your departure from Saudi Arabia, the Saudi-led coalition of militaries reportedly "dropped thousands of leaflets" from fighter jets over the Yemeni port city of Hodeida, a lifeline for a country on the brink of famine. The leaflets warned residents of an "impending offensive," and encouraged local support for a military assault. Press accounts considered this measure a "countdown" for an attack.

In light of these provocative Saudi actions, we wish to raise to your attention a recent letter to President Trump and Attorney General Sessions sent by a bipartisan group of 55 U.S. Representatives, which insisted that any direct U.S. involvement in the escalating war between the Saudi military coalition and Yemen's Houthi rebels be brought to Congress for debate and authorization before being carried out. That letter specifically questioned the legal basis for a proposal you were reported to have made in March: the provision of direct U.S. assistance for a Saudi coalition assault on Hodeida.

As you know, the UN Special Envoy to Yemen has stated, "We are definitely, unequivocally against any military operation" against Hodeida, which would have "very, very disastrous consequences" and could "tip the country into famine." Indeed, shipments imported through Hodeida amount to over 60 percent of all of Yemen's food, although "the Saudi navy is blockading" the port currently, "letting only a trickle through." For this reason, we concur with Senator Todd Young (R-IN), whose principal demand—"refrain from bombing the port of Hodeida"—was one of a number of sensible requests he directed to "our Saudi partners."

We are deeply disturbed by the words of UN Secretary General António Guterres, who warned that in Yemen "we are witnessing the starving and the crippling of an entire generation." And yet as children die in "the world's largest hunger crisis," he argued, "all those deaths could have been prevented." He concluded, "Only a cessation of hostilities and a political settlement can bring about a permanent end to the conflict and the suffering of the Yemeni people."

While we welcome your comments pressing for a diplomatic solution to the Yemen war, we note with concern that Pentagon officials continue to advance "logistical and intelligence support" for a Saudi coalition attack on Hodeida. As the administration weighs whether to "provide additional targeting help and other military aid" to the Saudis, some U.S. officials have alarmingly justified an assault on Hodeida to the press by claiming that "both sides would be more likely to compromise after one more military fight," and that "the Saudis need a face-saving way to justify a two-year war that has damaged their image abroad."

Due to the conflicting comments coming from the administration, we cordially invite you to come to Congress to brief us in person on the White House's overall strategy in Yemen at your earliest opportunity.In particular, we seek clarification on whether the administration is pursuing an immediate end to the violence by advocating multilateral negotiations—as we may infer from your comments—or if it is the case, as press reports seem to indicate, that the White House is "sympathetic" to the view that further "military pressure can force the Houthis to return to the bargaining table." We also seek urgent answers regarding the Saudi leafleting of Hodeida, and whether this prelude to an attack was performed after securing U.S. approval and assistance for an assault. In light of previous reporting of administration deliberations, any Saudi operation to seize Hodeida would be perceived as a U.S. effort.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) has publicly made clear that the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force to counter al-Qaeda would not apply to the Shia Houthis in Yemen. "Certainly engaging in a war" against the Houthis, he told the press, "is a step beyond the current authorization." As we await a response from the White House and the Office of Legal Counsel regarding their rationales for a U.S. escalation of hostilities in Yemen absent Congressional authorization, we ask for your cooperation in upholding the Constitutional principle of Congress's war powers by briefing us on the administration's plans.

In the face of Yemen's senseless humanitarian tragedy, where 19 million people need emergency support, we are committed to using our Constitutional authority to assert greater oversight over U.S. involvement in the conflict and promote greater public debate regarding U.S. military participation in Yemen's civil war, which has never been authorized by Congress. Should the administration remain unresponsive to our repeated inquiries into the nature of U.S. engagement in a potentially catastrophic Saudi attack on Hodeida, we will pursue legislation to explicitly prohibit U.S. involvement in any such an assault.# # #==
Title: As LGBTQ Students, Schools Grapple with “Trump Effect,” Murray, Baldwin, Pocan Redouble Efforts to Pass Anti-Harassment Legislation
Date: April 27, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
(Washington, D.C.) –Today, U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), along with Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI), reintroduced legislation aimed at reducing bullying and harassment that affects one in five students at colleges and universities across the country. TheTyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2017would require institutions of higher education to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The bill also establishes a grant program to support campus anti-harassment activities and programs. The legislation is named after Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University who took his own life after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over the Internet.

Lawmakers are deeply concerned with the rise of hateful and intimidating incidents spreading throughout college campuses nationwide, including actions undertaken by President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to withdraw guidance pertaining to discrimination against transgender students under Title IX of the education amendments of 1972, and the appointment of people to lead the Office for Civil Rights at the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services who apparently disagree or outright oppose the mission or role of the office and have advocated against the policy they now must enforce."Especially now, with a bully-in-chief in the White House, we need to make it clearer than ever that this kind of behavior simply should not be accepted,"said Senator Murray."No student should ever have to fear discrimination and harassment in their pursuit of education, no matter who they are, what they believe, or who they love. President Trump may have won the election, but I am going to keep fighting to make it clear that bullies will not win and bullying will not be tolerated. I made a promise to families like Tyler's, to keep fighting to protect our students, and I'm going to keep fighting for policies like this no matter how hard President Trump pushes us the other way.""No student should have to live in fear of being who they are. Our schools should not be, and cannot be, places of discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation or violence,"said Senator Baldwin."This legislation, named in honor of Tyler Clementi, is an important step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to succeed in safe and healthy communities of learning and achievement. Everyone at colleges and universities across America should be able to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.""No student should be harassed for who they are, or who they love,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Bullying is a real and persistent danger for many LGBTQ students at our colleges and universities, but there is no federal legislation that specifically protects students from being targeted based on sexual orientation or gender identity. President Trump has not yet shown that his Administration will defend the rights of LGBTQ students. That's why this bill is so important, as it ensures that institutions of higher learning are a place of open expression, which celebrate diversity and embrace students from all different backgrounds.""We are grateful for the continual support from Senators Murray, Baldwin, and Representative Pocan as they reintroduce the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to protect students from the harmful effects of bullying in institutions of higher education. Their commitment to join with us to make all institutions of higher education safe places to learn and thrive is commendable,"said Jane Clementi, co-founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation."I believe this bill will allow institutions of higher education to take a fresh look and reexamine their policies and procedures that are and are not in place. We must continue to provide safe and supportive learning environments for all students in all learning environments including higher education.""No student should be bullied or made to feel unsafe in the place they should feel the most secure -- their college or university,"said Chad Griffin, HRC President."Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan are committed to helping our young people thrive in an inclusive and supportive education environment, and we thank them for their unwavering leadership in championing this bill which will undoubtedly save lives and make our colleges and universities better and safer places.""LGBTQ college students, like all students, deserve safe, affirming, and inclusive campuses in which to learn and excel,"said Dr. Eliza Byard, GLSEN's Executive Director."GLSEN is incredibly thankful to Sens. Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Mark Pocan for again reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to help ensure all college students have access to safe and inclusive campuses. We look forward to working with members of Congress to pass this critically important bill.""This bill is an important step forward in combatting harassment on college campuses. A federal requirement that institutions of higher education have comprehensive anti-harassment policies is long overdue, and a grant program to support prevention and training programs and support for victims of harassment is sorely needed,"said Fatima Goss Graves, Senior Vice President for Program and President-Elect, National Women's Law Center.

Title: GOP’s Newest Version of Trumpcare Is So Bad They’ve Exempted Themselves From It
Date: April 26, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after House Republicans introduced an amendment to the Trumpcare plan, which failed to get a vote on the Floor last month. The amendment allows states to opt-out of popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Protections for preexisting conditions and requirements that insurers cover basic services like maternity care, cancer screenings, and addiction treatment could be taken away. In addition, the Republicans' amendment even exempts Members of Congress and their staff, ensuring they will keep these ACA protections."House Republicans showed their hand when they exempted themselves from their own plan. If this latest version of Trumpcare isn't good enough for Members of Congress, it's not good enough for the American people."The reason Trumpcare failed, was that the American people took a long hard look at what the President and Speaker Ryan put on the table and flatly rejected it. Now, House Republicans are trying to introduce a worse version of Trumpcare that will likely cause more people to lose health insurance, make it harder for people with preexisting conditions to get coverage, and leaves people at the mercy of insurance companies."# # #==

MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Wisconsin state senate heard arguments on a bill to repeal the state's prevailing wage laws."Once again, Governor Scott Walker and Wisconsin Republicans are putting corporate cash and the 1% ahead of working families. This bill to eliminate prevailing wage requirements for public projects will literally take money out of people's pockets and could allow companies to bring low-wage workers from out of state, undercutting wages throughout our state."We also know this legislation will do little to improve Wisconsin's roads, which are ranked as one of the worst in the country. I hope my former colleagues in the Wisconsin legislature see this for what it is, another boost for big business that winds up costing working Wisconsin families, and reject it."

Last week, Rep. Pocan along with U.S. Reps. Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), and Donald Norcross (D-NJ) held a "Future of Work, Wages, and Labor" discussion at the UW-Madison with academic professionals, policy makers, and labor representatives from around the country. This was the first Wisconsin event in a series of discussions and town halls that are being held this year in Congressional districts across the country. The goal of these discussions is to identify pathways forward to proactively grow and invigorate our labor force. Following the discussion on the UW-Madison campus, a listening session with labor leaders and local workers was held in Janesville, WI.# # #==

The goal of these discussions is to identify pathways forward to proactively grow and invigorate our labor force. Following the discussion on the UW-Madison campus, a listening session with labor leaders and local workers was held in Janesville, WI."Long before Donald Trump began talking about a rigged economy, Reps. DeSaulnier, Norcross, Dingell and I began investigating the ways conservative policy makers have been stacking the deck against workers in favor of big businesses and wealthy campaign donors,"said Congressman Pocan."Whether it is the evaporation of retirement security or the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, hard-working families have been suffering the consequences of conservative policies for nearly four decades. We have seen the GOP's war on workers in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker, and President Trump seems to be taking a page out of Walker's playbook by sticking it to the people who elected him. I'm proud to be joined on this trip by so many other members of Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to create a comprehensive set of policies to help working families get ahead.""The deck continues to be stacked against America's working families, and the Trump Administration is already enacting policies that favor the wealthy and leave the middle class behind,"said Congressman DeSaulnier. "I thank my friend Congressman Mark Pocan for hosting this discussion and for joining me to create the ‘Future of Work, Wages, and Labor,' an initiative aimed at finding solutions to help Americans earn a fair wage, provide for their families, own homes, and retire with dignity. Together, with the input from America's workforce, leading researchers, and our colleagues, like Representatives Donald Norcross and Debbie Dingell, we will fight to ensure our working families are dealt a fair hand."My top priority in Washington is fighting for higher wages and good jobs for American families. I am grateful to be able to join my colleagues in Wisconsin and around the country as we hear from local experts on how to create good-paying jobs,"said Congressman Norcross. "Having been an IBEW electrician, I know firsthand how hard-working men and women continue to be the backbone of our economy and make our country stronger and safer. I am honored to be working to shape policies that raise wages and put American workers first. I thank Representative Pocan for hosting us here in Wisconsin as we look at ways to expand opportunities for hard-working American families.""Developing policies and programs that strengthen our workforce ensures that the United States' labor movement remains strong and continues to support working families,"said Congresswoman Dingell."Thanks to Rep. Pocan for his leadership in addressing the obstacles faced by the American workforce and convening this critical dialogue that will help us better address the unique concerns of different industries and identify ways to proactively grow our labor force. Michigan remains an integral part of our country's workforce, and we know just how important the continued growth of the middle class and the creation of quality jobs are to all Americans. I look forward to welcoming my colleagues to Michigan in June to continue the discussion."# # #==
Title: Rep. Pocan Statement on Trump’s Kenosha Visit and Buy America Executive Order

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after President Trump visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, and announced an Executive Order reviewing Buy America policies. In December, Rep. Pocan wrote aletterto President-elect Trump asking him to enforce and expand the Buy America standards. The letter also highlighted the fact that Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans had just eliminated Buy America requirements for steel and iron used in our country's water infrastructure. To date, Rep. Pocan did not receive a response from the transition team, nor have White House officials responded in any capacity."Reviewing Buy America policies does little to keep the promises Trump made to Wisconsin workers. Many people in our state are feeling economically strapped and a short visit to my hometown of Kenosha to shake some hands will not ease that stress. We desperately need immediate, strong, and meaningful Buy America policies to ensure that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers. But in his first months as President, we've yet to see Trump take meaningful action on Buy America."While Trump is announcing this Executive Order in Speaker Paul Ryan's District, Republicans in Congress remain firmly opposed to expanding our Buy America standards. Instead of standing up for American workers, they consistently rally around legislation that strips these requirements and sends taxpayer dollars to companies that ship jobs overseas. I hope that the President will stand up to Speaker Paul Ryan and follow this review of Buy America policies with real action that will help the hardworking families find economic stability."# # #==

The Trump Administration is currently weighing options for direct military involvement in Yemen's two-year-old civil war, where a coalition of military forces led by Saudi Arabia has fought against Yemen's Houthi rebels. The Saudi coalition has conducted indiscriminate bombings and imposed a crippling blockade, provoking a dire humanitarian crisis in Yemen. This bipartisan effort also comes after President Trump showed his willingness to engage in Syrian missile strikes without Congressional authorization."Administration officials have proposed the U.S. participate directly in an attack on Yemen's major port,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "Such an attack could push the country into full-blown famine, where nearly half a million children in Yemen are facing starvation. Congress is a direct line to the people and this letter is a first step in reasserting our Constitutional check on presidential powers. I am committed to pursuing all tools at our disposal to ensure President Trump abides by our Constitution before possibly plunging our country into another senseless conflict.""The Constitution vests in Congress the power to commence war,"said Rep. Justin Amash. "If the president supports our involvement in a foreign war, he must make the case to Congress and the American people.""President Trump does not have the authority to send U.S. forces to battle the Houthis in Yemen, period,"Congressman Ted Lieu said."Once again, the Administration appears ready to ramp up U.S. involvement in a complicated civil war without a clear strategy in place or the necessary authorization from Congress. A unilateral decision for direct U.S. involvement in Yemen would be met by swift, bipartisan opposition."

April 10, 2017President Donald J. TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.Washington, DC 20500

CC: Attorney General Jeff Sessions

Dear Mr. President:

We write to express our serious concern over reports that your administration is actively considering "direct support for the anti-Houthi coalition" of militaries led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Administration officials are said to be weighing proposals to provide Saudi-led forces with "surveillance and intelligence, refueling, and operational planning assistance" against the Shia Houthis who control most of Yemen's population centers. One administration official acknowledged that the removal of preexisting White House prohibitions on such assistance could be viewed as "a green light for direct involvement in a major war."

Direct U.S. hostilities against Yemen's Houthis would run counter to your pledge to pursue a "disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy" that protects American families in "every decision." Indeed, according to U.S. defense officials, the U.S.-backed Saudi war against Houthis in Yemen has already "strengthened al Qaeda there" and poses "a serious threat to U.S. security."

We share the concerns of some of your advisers, who worry that direct support for the Saudi coalition's war against Houthis "would take too many resources away from the counterterrorism fight against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula." We are further troubled by news reports indicating that Al Qaeda in Yemen has "emerged as a de facto ally" of the Saudi-led militaries with whom your administration aims to partner more closely. According to press accounts, Al Qaeda in Yemen has fought against the Houthis on the same side as Saudi coalition forces in several battles near Taiz and al-Bayda, while also operating closely with Saudi-financed Islamist militias.

Moreover, Congress has never authorized the actions under consideration. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) sought and received by President George W. Bush, which has been interpreted to apply to Al Qaeda and associated forces, has never been cited by any government official as justification for U.S. involvement in military actions against Yemen's Houthis. The Houthis have never been "associated forces" to Al Qaeda; they are Zaydis, a branch of Shiite Islam, and strongly oppose the Sunni Al Qaeda, which promotes sectarian violence against Shia.

Engaging our military against Yemen's Houthis when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers clearly delineated in the Constitution. For this reason, we write to request that the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) provide, without delay, any legal justification that it would cite if the administration intends to engage in direct hostilities against Yemen's Houthis without seeking congressional authorization.

As U.S. Representatives, we take seriously the right and responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of force, or to refuse to do so, as mandated by the Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution. We expect that any direct military actions pursued by the administration against the Yemeni Houthis be brought before Congress for consideration and authorization for approval before they are executed.

In August 2013, when President Obama threatened to bomb Syrian government forces without congressional approval, a large, bipartisan group of U.S. Representatives objected. They urged the president "to consult and receive authorization from Congress," noting that the president's "responsibility to do so is prescribed in the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973." President Obama subsequently agreed to seek congressional authorization.

In light of the gravity of a potential U.S. military escalation in Yemen, we additionally seek the OLC's prompt legal opinions concerning:

• Defense Secretary James Mattis's proposal to aid the Saudi military coalition in seizing the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida. The current, Saudi-enforced blockade of Hodei-dah—a main entry point for food, medicine and humanitarian aid—is pushing Yemen to the brink of famine. Over 50 members of Congress have urged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to use "all U.S. diplomatic tools" to reopen the port, noting that nearly half a million Yemeni chil-dren are "nearing starvation." Saudi-led airstrikes have destroyed the Hodeidah province's roads and bridges, leaving "unexploded rockets" inside the port that further prevent vital aid shipments from effectively reaching the more than 7.3 million Yemenis in need of urgent food assistance. In addition to the possibility that a U.S.-assisted operation to capture Hodeidah could worsen Yemen's humanitarian situation, U.S. involvement in such an action has never been justified to Congress.
• Your administration's "increased logistical support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign" against Houthis in recent days. U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Chris Murphy have noted that the Obama administration never received congressional authorization for refueling and targeting assistance to Saudi coalition warplanes. We wish to know your legal justification for continuing and ex-panding this policy in the absence of such authorization.
• The recent threat by your administration to intercept an Iranian ship in international waters "to look for contraband weapons possibly headed to Houthi fighters in Yemen." While Secretary Mattis was reported to have "ultimately decided to set the operation aside, at least for now," we wish to know how such an interdiction—an act of hostilities—would be legally justified despite having no prior congressional authorization.

The United States has participated in Saudi-led airstrikes that have been blamed for most of Yemen's 10,000 civilian deaths, creating a security vacuum that Al Qaeda has exploited to expand its base of operations. We therefore urge you to terminate U.S. refueling for Saudi coalition warplanes and end, rather than increase, U.S. logistical assistance for the Saudi-led bombings in Yemen. At minimum, any decision by the administration to engage in direct U.S. hostilities against Yemen's Houthis must be subject to a congressional debate and vote, as the framers of the Constitution intended and the 1973 War Powers Resolution demands. As you know, the War Powers Resolution provides a mechanism for individual Members of Congress to force the question of congressional authorization if the administration is not forthcoming in seeking approval for a planned military action.

We await your prompt response regarding any legal rationale for U.S. participation in hostilities against Houthi forces in Yemen and whether your administration plans to seek approval from Congress. Your timely answer is appreciated as we explore how best to assert our constitutional role of oversight and authorization over such actions.# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) made the following statement today after President Trump ordered missile strikes on Syria last night."In the absence of an imminent threat to the United States, the president must seek Congressional authorization prior to any act of war. Trump failed to seek, much less gain, Congressional authorization."If President Trump believes that US military actions should be utilized against the Assad regime, he should immediately call the House and Senate back into session to debate and vote on the use of military force."These unauthorized attacks could pull the United States into a regional war and escalate this unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The best way President Trump could help the people of Syria would be to immediately abandon his inhumane ban on refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries, as well as his draconian cuts to diplomacy and international aid. If the suffering of the Syrian people is an 'affront to humanity,' now more than ever, we have a moral responsibility to offer safety and refuge to these families."

The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is the largest caucus within the House Democratic Caucus, with over 70 members standing up for progressive ideals in Washington and throughout the country. Since 1991, the CPC has advocated for progressive policies that prioritize working Americans over corporate interests, fight economic and social inequality, and promote civil liberties. The CPC champions progressive policy solutions like comprehensive immigration reform, a $15 national minimum wage, fair trade, gun violence reform, debt-free college, and making the federal government a Model Employer.==
Title: Rep. Pocan Introduces Legislation to Close Tax Loopholes and Bring Transparency to Corporations That Hide Their Profits Overseas
Date: April 6, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) introduced theTax Fairness and Transparency Actto close tax loopholes and bring transparency to corporations that hide their profits overseas. The legislation takes three common sense steps to make our tax system more equitable; it removes incentives for corporate tax inversions, ends tax deferrals on overseas profits, and brings transparency to profit-shifting schemes."Wall Street banks and big corporations rigged the system to dodge taxes and hide their profits overseas,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "These companies skirt their responsibilities, while small businesses and working families play by the rules and pay their fair share. This legislation closes tax loopholes, incentivizing businesses to stay in the United States, and creates transparency requirements that shed light on firms engaging in tax avoidance and profit shifting activities. By taking these simple steps to crack down on tax dodgers and companies that hide their profits overseas, we can help level the playing field for the American people."

TheTax Fairness and Transparency Acttakes the following steps to create a more equitable tax system:

1. Removes incentives for corporate inversions:Earnings stripping is a method of avoiding taxes in which U.S.-based companies are loaded up with debt owed to the affiliated foreign company; the U.S. entity then pays high levels of interest on this debt, which nets them significant tax deductions or entirely wipes out their domestic taxable income. This bill limits the tax deductions a corporation may claim to a level at which the U.S. entity's share of interest on debt is proportionate to the U.S. entity's share of earnings. Without the option to shift profits overseas through earnings stripping, corporations lose a major incentive to move their headquarters abroad.
2. Ends tax deferral on overseas profits:Currently corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign profits until that money is repatriated back to the U.S. This bill closes the loophole and requires controlled foreign corporations to pay U.S. taxes on active income.
3. Brings transparency to profit-shifting schemes:This bill requires all publicly traded companies to make available to the American people information about multinational tax and business activities on a country-by-country basis, and total profits and taxes paid during the period covered by the report. Arecent reportfrom the FACT Coalition details how the tax strategies of public companies directly impact shareholder risk and market function. Country-by-country tax reporting information must be made publicly available so investors and the general public are sufficiently able to assess investment risk and identify profit-shifting activities.# # #==

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after President Trump signed two trade Executive Orders, one which establishes a study on trade deficits and one which reviews current enforcement mechanisms."During his campaign, Donald Trump talked about the disastrous impact of our trade agreements on American workers and promised immediate action to level the playing field. Today's toothless Executive Orders are yet another example of President Trump being mostly talk and little action. Despite his rhetoric calling NAFTA the ‘worst trade deal ever' and labeling our China trade policy a disaster, he hasn't taken any meaningful action to address these problems. He broke his promise to declare China a currency manipulator on day one and has yet to address our trade deficit with China. He's already reneged on his ‘Buy American' promise to use American steel for major construction projects and has so far failed to start the process of renegotiating NAFTA. President Trump likes to talk about bringing jobs back to the United States, but so far he, has done nothing to help workers here at home. Unfortunately, this is just another broken promise to the American people who need real action."# # #==

President Obama implemented the rule to resolve problems with contractor compliance and workplace safety by requiring companies to disclose past violations of labor laws so that contracting officers can make informed decisions about which firms are likely to use taxpayer dollars responsibly."President Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back good, family-supporting jobs to the United States. Instead he has broken another promise by ensuring crooked contractors continue to do business with the Federal government. In The Art of the Deal, President Trump urges readers to maximize their leverage, and to avoid looking desperate to make a deal. In this instance, however, he can't hide his desperation to please the Wall Street alumni in the White House and in his Cabinet. By signing this misguided legislation, Trump is turning his back on federal contract workers rather than boosting wages and improving workplace safety. It's unfortunate the President insists on hiding from the public while signing legislation that will hurt working Americans who elected him."

Federal contractors havefrequentlybeen caught illegally underpaying their workers and violating wage and hour laws. More than 690 companies have been caught violating wage-related contractor labor laws multiple times and more than 300,000 workers have been the victims of wage-related labor violations while working under federal contracts in the last decade.# # #==

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) led aletterwith 39 Members of Congress to President Trump demanding he apologize for repeatedly spreading a lie that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Last week, the Chair of the House Intel Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, tried to spin Trump's widely debunked wiretapping claims by releasing new unconfirmed information to the press concerning surveillance of associates to Trump. Yesterday, in aninterviewon FOX News Sunday with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Chris Wallace asked if Trump was ready to apologize regarding his accusations of wiretapping.

TheWall Street JournalEditorial Board also didn't mince words when it said, President Trump is damaging the presidency "with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods." In the interest of our national security and credibility as the leader of the free world, it is vital Trump is held accountable for these baseless accusations.

In the letter, the Members of Congress state:"As this investigation continues, we urge you and your Administration to follow a simple rule: tell the truth. Further distracting the American people with inaccurate statements and attempts to deflect from the serious nature of this investigation are harmful to our national security and the integrity of this important investigation. We respectfully request you correct the record and offer an apology immediately."

The text of the letter is below and an electronic copy can be foundhere.

Dear President Trump:

We are writing to demand you apologize to President Obama for the recent false claims you made about the Obama Administration wiretapping Trump Tower.

During the House Intelligence Committee's public hearing regarding Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that President Trump lied when he inappropriately used his Twitter account to accuse President Obama's administration of wiretapping Trump Tower. To quote FBI Director Comey, "I have no information to support those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI…"

FBI Director Comey also confirmed the disturbing revelation that there is an ongoing investigation into potential collusion between your 2016 campaign operatives and the Russian government. As this investigation continues, we urge you and your Administration to follow a simple rule: tell the truth. Further distracting the American people with inaccurate statements and attempts to deflect from the serious nature of this investigation are harmful to our national security and the integrity of this important investigation. We respectfully request you correct the record and offer an apology immediately.# # #==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after a vote on Trumpcare was pulled from consideration by Speaker Paul Ryan."This is a victory for everyone who contacted Congressional offices to voice their opposition to this bill. These calls paid off and showed President Trump and Speaker Ryan that you cannot ram a bill through Congress while ignoring the concerns of the American people. Thanks to the grassroots efforts of people across the country, we stopped President Trump and Speaker Ryan's attempt to kick 24 million people off their health insurance."Pulling Trumpcare from consideration today marks a major legislative defeat for President Trump and Congressional Republicans and a tremendous win for the American people whose voices were heard loud and clear in the Capitol."

As of this afternoon, Rep. Pocan's office received over 7,369 calls and emails in opposition to Trumpcare and only 54 in support of the bill. That amounts to about 136 times more people against this bill than in favor of it.==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bipartisan Bill Allowing Students to Refinance their College Loans
Date: March 21, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced the bipartisan Student Loan Refinancing Act, which would allow borrowers to refinance their federal student loans any time a lower interest rate is available."With college debt skyrocketing, Congress should be doing everything it can to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt,"said Rep. Pocan."The Student Loan Refinancing Act will allow nearly 44 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like a mortgage or car loan. This bill would bring down the long-term cost of a college degree."

Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by at least 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. In 2015, the average undergraduate student borrower left school with $30,100 in student loans, which is a 4% increase from 2014."College is an increasingly necessary precondition for 21st-century middle-class jobs, and Americans who want to go to college deserve an affordable, accessible pathway to college,"said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten."That is why this bill is so important: It provides immediate financial relief to millions of students and families, freeing them from unnecessarily burdensome debt, and makes it clear that student loans should help further students' lives, not hold them back. President Trump's budget proposals this week curtailing student aid programs--at a time when far too many students incur crippling debt--in pursuit of a higher degree make Rep. Pocan's bill more urgent than ever.""Rep. Pocan's Student Loan Refinancing Act will help hundreds of thousands of borrowers in Wisconsin alone to refinance their student loans, just like you can a mortgage,"said One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross."Student loan borrowers did the right thing by working hard to pay for their technical college or university education and allowing them to refinance their loans treats them fairly in a system that's rigged against them and gives them a shot at their piece of the American Dream."

The bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Reps. Don Beyer (D-VA), Brendan Boyle (D-PA), Julia Brownley (D-CA), Matt Cartwright (D-PA), Kathy Castor (D-FL), Judy Chu (D-CA), Yvette Clarke (D-NY), John Conyers (D-MI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Glenn Grothman (R-WI), Brian Higgins (D-NY), John Katko (R-NY), Ted Lieu (D-CA), David Loebsack (D-IA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Donald Payne, Jr (D-NJ), Earl Perlmutter (D-CO), Bobby Rush (D-IL), Kurt Schrader (D-OR), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Frederica Wilson (D-FL).==
Title: Comprehensive Legislation Would Safeguard Future Elections from Cyber-Attacks
Date: March 16, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – In light of the widespread Russian interference in the 2016 election, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Hank Johnson (D-GA) today introduced the Securing America's Future Elections (SAFE) Act. This comprehensive legislation would safeguard our elections from future foreign cyber-attacks and interference by permanently classifying the integrity and security of our elections as a key component of critical infrastructure. This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities. The SAFE Act also addresses election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines that provide paper ballots, and random audits of ballots to thwart interference.

As we continue to uncover the extent of Russia's aggressive cyber tactics against the 2016 election and potential Russian ties to the Trump Administration, Republicans on the House Administration Committee voted to shut down the Election Administration Committee (EAC), the federal agency created to help states improve their election systems and security. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers. The SAFE Act would reauthorize the EAC for a period of 10 years and require a random audit of precincts/wards in each state to ensure there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots."We must make sure the widespread Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election never happens again,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "That's why we are introducing this comprehensive approach to secure our election process from start to finish. By making our elections a top national security priority, we can ensure cybersecurity standards for voting systems are upgraded and require paper ballots with all electronic voting machines. One thing Democrats and Republicans should agree on is that we should be doing everything in our power to guarantee the sovereignty of our county and the integrity of our elections. This bill will do just that.""Few things are as critical as the integrity of our elections, which is why we must protect one of our most sacred institutions from foreign powers and domestic hackers who seek to undermine and influence our democratic process,"said Rep. Keith Ellison. "The SAFE Act makes our elections a top national security priority, creates cybersecurity standards to protect our voting systems, and ensures accountability to voters. The American people must have full confidence that their votes are protected and counted. Russia nor any other country should be able to interfere in our elections ever again, which is why we must pass the SAFE Act.""Recent reports documenting an alleged data breach at Georgia's Center For Elections Systems – involving as much as 7.5 million voter records – serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our election infrastructure,"said Rep. Hank Johnson. "As a fundamental tenet of our democracy, our voting systems are a matter of national security and we must make sure they are not compromised or disrupted by outside parties. Expressing Congress' support to designate our voting systems as critical infrastructure will encourage the Department of Homeland Security and the states to better coordinate, engage, and share resources that will improve the security of our electoral process. The SAFE Act will help ensure the security of our voting systems and preserve public faith in the integrity of our electoral process."

The SAFE Act would:

1. Permanently classify the security and integrity of our elections as essential to the United States' national security interests and allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure. This includes storage facilities, polling places, vote tabulation locations, voter databases, voting machines, and other systems that manage the election process. This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities.

2. Authorize the necessary funding for upgrading cybersecurity standards of voting systems, including the software used to operate such systems, and to ensure the security of the manufacturing processes for such components through collaboration with the National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security. The bill will also ensure cybersecurity for all voter registration databases.

3. Require NIST and DHS to create basic cybersecurity standards for private companies contracted to work on elections systems in the US.

4. Require all electronic voting machines to have a corresponding paper ballot. The EAC would be required to randomly audit 5% of wards/precincts in each state to ensure that there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots.

5. Reauthorize the EAC (Election Assistance Commission) for a period of 10 years. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers.

6. Require the DHS to conduct a review of elections systems yearly beginning in 2018.==

Rehashing this hateful and divisive travel ban not only sends the wrong message to immigrants and refugees, it also makes our country less safe. The President should be focused on helping working families struggling to make ends meet, not waging an unconstitutional war on our core American value of freedom from persecution and discrimination."I will stand alongside the people of my district and fight with my colleagues in Congress against this prejudice and division. My office will continue to work to support residents and visitors experiencing difficulties as a result of the travel ban while the courts ultimately decide the fate of this unconstitutional ban."==

Pocan said."But now, he has decided that a major construction project will not abide from his own Buy America plan. House Republicans have already shown their hand by opposing provisions to permanently require American steel be used in our country's infrastructure projects. If President Trump is concerned with livelihood of American workers, he should take steps to ensure the Buy America Act is strongly and meaningfully enforced. Unfortunately, the President's talk about "Buy America" is proving to be just another broken promise to the American people."

Pocansent a letterto the Trump transition team asking the President to enforce and expand the Buy America Act, and also highlighting Congressional Republican leadership's opposition to requirements that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers.

The letter also asks the President to meet with transgender students and their families to hear their stories and learn from their experiences.

In the bipartisan letter, the Members of Congress state:"Title IX provides transgender students the right to equal treatment in accordance with their gender identity. Unfortunately, rescinding this guidance only serves to confuse school administrators and take away a vital tool for students and their families who want to be treated with dignity and respect."Further, this action sends the wrong message - a very dangerous message - to transgender youth and their peers. For these reasons, we urge you to reverse your decision and reinstate the Title IX guidance."

President Donald J. Trump

The White House

Washington, DC 20500

Dear President Trump:

We write to urge you to reconsider your decision to rescind important Title IX guidance detailing schools' obligation to protect transgender students from discrimination. The guidance set forth by both the Departments of Education and Justice in May 2016 has helped educational institutions answer common, practical questions concerning this population of students while maintaining compliance with the law. Further, we ask you and members of your administration to meet with transgender students and their families who have relied on this guidance for a safe learning environment and hear their stories about what it means to be transgender in school.

Hundreds of thousands of transgender students live and attend school in every part of our country. A recent report by the Williams Institute estimated there are over 350,000 transgender teens and young adults between ages 13 and 24 in America. Studies show that transgender students are healthy and successful when they receive support and fair treatment, but too many of these students face discrimination. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that more than three-quarters (77%) of respondents who identified or were perceived as transgender in K–12 school had one or more negative experiences, such as being verbally harassed, prohibited from dressing according to their gender identity, or physically or sexually assaulted.

Singling out transgender students by excluding them from school facilities and forcing them to use separate facilities is a real and harmful form of discrimination that causes humiliation and puts students at risk for bullying and health problems.

The federal guidance issued in May 2016 pertaining to transgender students reflects over a decade of case law and proven best practices from schools around the country. The Departments issued this guidance at the request of educators across the country seeking clarification about how to best comply with existing laws. National leaders in education - including the leading associations of teachers, principals, pediatricians, and school counselors and psychologists - supported this clarification.

Title IX provides transgender students the right to equal treatment in accordance with their gender identity. Unfortunately, rescinding this guidance only serves to confuse school administrators and take away a vital tool for students and their families who want to be treated with dignity and respect. Further, this action sends the wrong message - a very dangerous message - to transgender youth and their peers.

For these reasons, we urge you to reverse your decision and reinstate the Title IX guidance. Furthermore, we urge you, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to meet with transgender students and their families to hear firsthand about their school experiences. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C.- Congressional Progressive Caucus First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) released the following statements today after new information came to light that Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied under oath concerning his meetings with Russian officials."Lying under oath about contacts with Russian officials supersedes recusal. Attorney General Jeff Sessions must resign and the American people deserve an independent investigation,"Rep. Pocan said."Since it has now come to light that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have lied under oath about meeting with Russian officials during the campaign, we must be entirely clear on one thing: perjury is a felony and may be punishable by prison for up to five years,"Rep. Ellison said."Jeff Sessions is unfit to serve the American people, and he should resign immediately. He lied at his Senate confirmation hearing about meeting with Russian authorities twice during the campaign,"Rep. Grijalva said."Given the dark clouds surrounding this administration's ties to Russia, and the aid Trump received from the kremlin during the election, these lies are clear grounds for dismissal. Moreover, the Department of Justice must put in place a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump administration and campaign's connections to Russia."###==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement after the President delivered his Joint Address to Congress:"We have heard the President stand in front of a teleprompter and deliver a speech full of empty promises and self-serving boasts before. At the end of the day, what matters to hard-working people in this country struggling to make ends meet are actions. So far, this President has done little to improve economic conditions and provide real help for working families. We have heard a lot of words from the President, but seen precious few policies from the White House that would create economic stability in our country. Instead, we have seen an Administration focused on spreading fear and hatred, while putting Wall Street banks and CEOs ahead of working people."From implementing a ban on people based on their religion to his alarming rhetoric on immigrants like my guest, Lupe ﻿Salermón, the President has made divisiveness a core value of his Administration. While this might play well in Trump Tower or at Mar-a-Lago – the United States is a diverse country full of people who work hard for a better future. The President is moving our country backwards with his divisional stance on immigration and support for tearing families apart to score political points."This is a President who would like claim he is on the side of working people, but his own actions as a ‘businessman' hurt workers and small businesses. His cabinet is full of Wall Street Bankers, multi-millionaires and billionaires who took advantage of an economy rigged against working families. It's also no surprise his tax plan will be full of tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations. These are not the actions of a President who wants to see working Americans succeed."There are still a lot of question marks surrounding this President on everything from his tax returns to his conflicts of interest to his potential ties to Russia and their interference in our election. I hope that the American people hear what the President said tonight and hold him to a higher standard when it comes to his actions and policies."==

Mark Pocan (D-WI) announced today that he is honored to be joined by Lupe Salmeron, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and student at Edgewood College, as his guest to President Trump's Joint Address to Congress next week on Tuesday, February 28. Lupe is one of the estimated 1.3 million youth across the country eligable for deportation exemption under DACA, after immigrating to Wisconsin from Mexico twelve years ago."This year, President Trump's Joint Address to Congress gives us an opportunity to highlight intelligent, passionate immigrants, like Lupe, who make our communities a better, stronger place,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "Trump has used the presidency to spread lies, fear and hatred about immigrants. It's important to share Lupe's story and highlight the many positive contributions immigrants make to our communities. I am extremely impressed by Lupe's experiences and her drive to engage in issues affecting immigrants in Wisconsin and across the country.""As an undocumented immigrant, I've always felt safe growing up in Madison, but since the election President Trump has opened up a whole new world of fear among immigrants,"said Lupe Salmeron. "You just don't know how his policies or his words will change people's minds and affect your daily life. I'm honored to attend the Joint Address to Congress and speak out on behalf of the experiences of undocumented immigrants. Together we must help create a safe space for undocumented and youth of color to talk, debrief and organize in."

Lupe Salmeron is a graduate of Madison East High School where she was class president. Born in Mexico City, Lupe immigrated to the United States twelve years ago in pursuit of the American Dream. She is currently a Freshman at Edgewood College in Madison, pursuing a degree in Political Science, with hopes of one day becoming an immigration lawyer and helping people who are struggling with the immigration process.

"Trump ha utilizado la presidencia para difundir mentiras, miedo y odio. Es importante compartir la historia de Lupe y destacar las contribuciones positivas de los inmigrantes a nuestras comunidades. Estoy muy impresionado por las experiencias de Lupe y su impulso para involucrarse en asuntos que afectan a los inmigrantes en Wisconsin y en todo el país"."Como inmigrante indocumentada, siempre me he sentido segura creciendo en Madison, pero a partir de las elecciones, el Presidente Trump ha desatraillado una nueva realidad aterradora para los inmigrantes", dijo Lupe Salmerón. "Simplemente no se sabe cómo sus políticas o sus palabras cambiarán las mentes de la gente y afectarán tu vida diaria. Me siento honrada de asistir al discurso de Trump ante el Congreso y poder manifestar en defensa de otros inmigrantes indocumentados. Juntos debemos todos crear espacios seguros para que los jóvenes indocumentados y de diversas etnias puedan hablar, hacer intercambio y organizarse".

Lupe Salmerón es una graduada de la secundaria Madison East donde ella era presidente de su clase. Nacida en Ciudad de México, Lupe y su familia inmigraron a Estados Unidos hace doce años a Wisconsin en busca del Sueño Americano.

Title: Reps. Pocan and Ellison Introduce Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment
Date: February 16, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), along with Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and 24 original cosponsors introduced a resolution, which would explicitly guarantee the right to vote. At a time when voting rights across the country have come under unprecedented assault and faith in our election process is being undermined by President Trump, the Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the U.S. Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote.

While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution contains no expressed guarantee of an individual's right to vote. A constitutional amendment can ensure this right is guaranteed while also providing a pathway to challenge attempts to restrict voting rights."The biggest strength of our democracy is that all citizens have an equal say through their vote,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."We have seen constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. Our current President has also spread lies about illegal voting in what clearly looks like an attempt to undermine our election process. This constitutional amendment would help prevent these attempts to erode voting rights and affirm the principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen. Our democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate, and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people.""Our democracy gains strength when more Americans participate in elections,"Rep. Keith Ellison said."But millions cannot vote today because of restrictive voting laws in some states – and President Trump has pledged to expand those laws nationwide. A constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote would help stop this voter suppression. In 2016, 14 states had new restrictions in place for the first time in a presidential election. The impact this has on civic participation is devastating. Particularly for low-income communities and communities of color. Voting is central to the health of our democracy—every citizen in this country should have an inalienable right to vote.""The vote is the most powerful non-violent tool for change that we have in a democratic society,"Rep. John Lewis said."We need to make it simple and easy for every American citizen, who is of voting age, to weigh in on the matters that govern their lives. This bill guarantees that eligible citizens cannot be so easily disenfranchised, and the right of each have a say in the democratic process is protected."

The ongoing assault on voting rights in states across the country underscores the need for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 46 bills to restrict access to registration and voting have been introduced in 21 states as of February 1, 2017, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.

This legislation is also cosponsored by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Brendan Boyle (D-PA), Matt Cartwright (D-PA), Judy Chu (D-CA), Steven Cohen (D-TN), John Conyers (D-MI), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-DC), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Lucille Roybal Allard (D-CA), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Mark Takano (D-CA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ).

The text of the amendment is below:

SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.

SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.==

Dear President Trump:

I am writing to request that the fully classified version of the report "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections" be declassified for the benefit of all Americans. I strongly believe Americans have a right to know information which has yet to be declassified regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Sincerely,

Title: Rep. Pocan Says Boeing Employees Should Tune Out Unsolicited Advice from Sen. Graham, Consider Merits of Choice to Unionize
Date: February 13, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after Senator Lindsey Graham made comments that insinuated Boeing could relocate should the workers in their Charleston, South Carolina, plant vote to unionize."Senator Graham demonstrates his apathy to workers in his state when he suggests that Boeing relocate out of South Carolina if workers choose to unionize. He also suggested that a vote for the union would negatively impact workers throughout the region. In fact, the opposite is true. Study after study shows workers in unions earn more money. Further evidence demonstrates the benefits of unions go way beyond their own members, by raising the wages of non-unionized workers as well."Boeing employees voting in the bargaining unit on Wednesday should tune out unsolicited advice from elected officials, and consider the merits of the choice before them. Perhaps the Senator should have asked his constituents if they want a say in their workplace and better pay and benefits. Or if he thought Boeing's Board of Directors should be making the decisions about their pay and benefits?"==

Walter Shaub

Director, U.S. Office of Government Ethics

1201 New York Ave NW #500

Washington, DC 20005

Dear Mr. Schaub:

We are writing to request your review of potential ethics violations concerning Kellyanne Conway's recent public comments encouraging Americans to purchase items from the fashion line produced by President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to President Trump, is a federal employee and appears to have clearly violated federal ethics laws delineated by the Office of Government Ethics.

According to the Office of Government Ethics, "An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity." In a February 9, 2017, interview from the White House press briefing room with the Fox News Channel, Kellyanne Conway urged Americans to "go buy Ivanka's stuff…It's a wonderful line. I own some of it…I fully---I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online."

Across the government, federal employees are expected to be held to a high standard of ethics. As a federal employee, Kellyanne Conway appears to have clearly violated these standards with her recent comments. It is especially troubling that Kellyanne Conway appears to have used her position of power in the White House to directly enrich the Trump family through Ivanka Trump's fashion line. Such a blatant disregard for federal law and ethics standards set for public servants undermines public faith in our government.

We encourage you to use your authority Congress granted your office under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, to examine the blatant and inappropriate remarks made by Kellyanne Conway immediately and ensure members of the Trump Administration do not continue to use their positions of power to enrich members of the Trump family.# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) made the following statement on the confirmation of Rep. Tom Price (R-MI) as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)."Rep. Tom Price has led the Republican crusade to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid as we know it. As the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Price has advocated for privatizing Medicare, and turning it into a voucher program, which would increase costs and harm our seniors and most vulnerable Americans."He has worked to defund Planned Parenthood in order to restrict women's access to comprehensive reproductive health services. And he has introduced legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which would threaten health care coverage for more than 20 million newly insured Americans."With Price's confirmation today, it is clear that Republicans are doubling down on their efforts to destroy these fundamental programs and turn health care over to the hands of insurance companies."Health care is a right, not a privilege. The CPC will oppose any attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, privatize Medicare, or destroy Medicaid. We will fight to guarantee high-quality health care for all regardless of gender, age, or income."# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) along with CPC First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement on the confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General:"Senator Jeff Sessions has a long, alarming history as a U.S. attorney and Senator that is tinged with racism and discrimination. By confirming him for Attorney General, Senate Republicans are elevating his hateful values to the Justice Department."As Coretta Scott King stated in her testimony opposing Mr. Sessions' nomination as a federal district court judge in 1986:

‘The irony of Mr. Sessions' nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods.'"What was true of Mr. Sessions as a potential judge in 1986 remains true today. As a U.S. attorney, Sessions used the authority of his office to target and intimidate African Americans who were attempting to exercise their right vote. As a U.S. Senator, he voted against vital hate crime protections for LGBT people, and opposed the Constitutional right for women to make reproductive health decisions."We know what happens when hate is enshrined in law. We've spent generations addressing the wounds of slavery, discrimination, voter intimidation, unequal rights and hate. We've seen tremendous progress in some areas, and sadly not enough in others. Where we've gained ground, Mr. Sessions often opposed. Where no progress has been made, Mr. Sessions often led its blockade."The CPC will oppose any effort by Senator Sessions that echoes his hateful history. We are watching, and we will fight back."###==
Title: After Years of Destructive Cuts to Wisconsin, Pocan Says Gov. Walker’s Budget Too Little Too Late
Date: February 8, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his state budget proposal:"Governor Walker is asking the people of Wisconsin to join him in embracing alternative facts and to view an alt-reality budget where his years of destructive cuts to our public schools, our roads and other vital infrastructure never actually happened. This budget proposal is first and foremost about helping Scott Walker and not about helping Wisconsinites trying to make ends meet."The budget creates a new set of talking points for Governor Walker's future political ambitions, but his record of lackluster job growth in our state speaks for itself. Walker's newly proposed investments in the state are meager compared to the austerity measures he has forced on Wisconsin public schools, technical colleges and struggling families. Unfortunately, it's too little, too late."Regardless the shade of lipstick Governor Walker puts on the pig, because of his massive cuts to our public education system and universities over the last six years, the state is experiencing a race to the bottom where our public schools are left to raid one another in search for qualified teachers. Teachers are leaving Wisconsin to states like Minnesota where there is greater support for public education. Students across the state are graduating with massive amounts of debt, wages are stagnant and Wisconsin's job-growth is still sluggish at best."==

WASHINGTON D.C. – Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) made the following statement today after Betsy DeVos was confirmed as Secretary of Education by the U.S. Senate. Ms. DeVos, having failed to earn the support of a majority of Senators, had to rely on Vice President Pence's vote to break a 50-50 tie for the first time in U.S. history."Today, Senate Republicans voted against the best interests of America's students and working families, and in favor of billionaires, who put profits ahead of the education of our children. Betsy DeVos is unqualified to serve as Secretary of Education because she doesn't believe in public education."DeVos has no experience working in public education, and her recent Senate confirmation hearings demonstrated she lacks the knowledge, experience, and compassion to run a Department of Education that works for all students and puts their interests first. She has worked tirelessly to gut funding for public education and has fought to turn schools into profit-making schemes for her wealthy friends. Student debt and the cost of childcare continue to be two of the most pressing issues in our country, yet DeVos has been silent on bold solutions like debt-free college and universal childcare. And she has a history of opposing equal protections for LGBTQ students."Americans have voiced an overwhelming opposition to DeVos' nomination. The CPC will continue to fight with these Americans for a strong public school system that serves all students, regardless of their ZIP code. Again, Trump, who promised to drain the swamp and stand up for working people, has betrayed on both scores as he adds yet another billionaire who seeks to line the pockets of their friends at the expense of the American people by privatizing our education."###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.- Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) along with CPC First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement announcing the introduction of H.R. 932, The Mobility, Opportunity, and Vocation Enabling (MOVE) Act:"America is falling behind when it comes to our transportation needs. This doesn't just mean driving on crumbling roads – it means missed opportunities to provide transportation equity that can help reduce poverty, unemployment and the financial burdens of people who work hard for a living. By providing greater access to jobs and more affordable, accessible transportation options – the greatest social mobility factor – we can help communities thrive."We must invest in our transportation needs and spend the dollars wisely. The MOVE Act would help increase connections to jobs, provide more options for getting around, and help ensure that all Americans have access to the benefits of our transportation infrastructure. This is an initiative with bipartisan support that will help millions – that's why this policy was included in the Transportation appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017. We look forward to working with Republicans on this common-sense measure again this year."

The MOVE Act will direct the Department of Transportation to create performance measures for transportation planning that would assess:

· Cumulative increase in residents' connection to jobs;

· Accessibility for disadvantaged populations; and

· The variety of modes of transportation available to users, such as public transportation, roads and highways, and bike and pedestrian pathways.

State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations would then set performance targets under each measure and report their progress in reaching these targets to the public.

Organizations supporting the MOVE Act include: Transportation for America, PolicyLink, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.###==
Title: Pocan Says National Right-to-Work-For-Less Law Would be Catastrophic for Workers
Date: February 2, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after House Republicans unveiled legislation which would implement "right-to-work" policies across the country."A national right-to-work law would be catastrophic for hard-working Americans across the country. As we have seen in other states, including my home state of Wisconsin, these right-to-work-for-less laws have nothing to do with helping businesses or creating jobs. These laws are a means to ensure greater corporate control of our politics and our society. They reduce wages and salaries for workers, cut benefits such as health insurance and a pension, and diminish workers' voices on workplace protections."When workers have a voice in their workplace the middle class is strong. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. Unions raise standards across all industries, increasing the wages of both unionized and non-unionized workers. But yet again, House Republicans are ignoring the facts and putting partisanship and special interests above the livelihoods of workers. I hope Speaker Ryan is wise enough not to bring this bill to the floor."

A recent Pew survey shows that 60% of Americans—an overwhelming majority—support unions. Also, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, union workers' wages are 27 percent greater than for non-union workers. Seventy-nine percent of unionized workers receive health insurance from their employers, compared to only 49 percent of non-union workers. Seventy-six percent of union workers have guaranteed defined-benefit pension plans, compared to only 16 percent of non-union workers. Eighty-three percent of union workers receive paid sick leave compared to only 62 percent of non-union workers.==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Huffman, and Nolan Introduce New Deal Rural Broadband Act to Close Digital Divide in Rural America
Date: February 1, 2017
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.- Congressmen Mark Pocan (D-WI), Jared Huffman (D-CA), and Rick Nolan(D-MN) today introduced the New Deal Rural Broadband Act of 2017, an ambitious plan to connect every American home, business, and school to high-speed, reliable broadband internet that is based on Roosevelt's New Deal rural electrification model. The legislation would expand access to broadband internet in rural communities in Huffman's North Coast congressional district, and across the nation, through increased investments in broadband infrastructure, improved programs to support tribal communities in broadband development, and the establishment of a new Office of Rural Broadband Initiatives to better coordinate all Federal rural broadband deployment programs.

In 2016, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 39% of rural America and 41% of those living on Tribal land lacked access to advanced broadband, defined as 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. By comparison, only 10% of the country as a whole lack access to advanced broadband."Across our country, many people still lack basic and reliable access to the internet. Congress must work together to address the connectivity gap and ensure that communities, especially in rural America, are able to stay connected to the 21st Century economy,"said Rep. Pocan."The New Deal Broadband Act is a comprehensive plan to address broadband connectivity across our nation and I am proud to introduce this bill with my colleagues Reps. Huffman and Nolan.""The longer we allow the digital divide to persist in rural America and Indian country, the more Americans will be left behind,"said Rep. Huffman. "The New Deal Broadband Act is an ambitious blueprint to connect every home, school, and business in America to high-speed, reliable broadband so we can all compete in the world economy. All Americans deserve the benefits of improved economic development, as well as expanded public safety, health, and education services. Our new legislation builds on the legacy and success of FDR's New Deal to bring broadband access in rural America into the 21st century.""Rural America has waited long enough for high-speed broadband,"Rep. Nolan said. "It's a necessity required to start new businesses, create new good-paying jobs, help our small town rural economy grow, and modernize the education and health care services so essential to quality of life. I'm proud to join my colleague in introducing this legislation.""Current federal rural broadband policy is not favorable to California," said Connie Stewart, Executive Director of the California Center for Rural Policy at Humboldt State University. "Of the more than 110 federally recognized tribes in the state, 84 do not qualify for RUS grant funding. We would like to thank Congress Huffman for his leadership in bringing a comprehensive federal rural broadband policy to life""The lack of access to broadband in rural America remains a major challenge. Incumbents have not really acted fast enough to closed the digital divide. Unless we solve this need, we create an even larger urban-rural economic gap. an even larger urban-rural economic gap," said Tom West, Manager of the North Bay North Coast Broadband Consortium. " Rep. Huffman's proposed broadband infrastructure investment would create new opportunities on the North Coast to ensure all homes, schools, and businesses have access to high-speed, reliable broadband."

In January, Senate Democrats unveiled a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that included $20 billion in broadband infrastructure investment.

The New Deal Rural Broadband Act would:

· Establish a new Office of Rural Broadband Initiatives to coordinate and centralize all Federal rural broadband programs;

· Authorize $20 billion for new broadband infrastructure focused on rural communities and those without adequate access;

· Authorize a new Tribal Broadband Assistance Program to support tribal communities in broadband deployment;

· Improve and modernize the Telecommunications Loan and Loan Guarantee Program to increase eligibility, allow greater flexibility, and break down federal agency broadband "silos";

· Authorize the Rural Utility Service (RUS) to offer broadband grants in addition to loans and loan guarantees to provide small communities with the seed funds needed to compete in loan applications or develop commercially attractive proposals and increase overall (RUS) broadband investment from $25 million to $50 million annually; and

· Establish an inventory of Federal and State assets on which a broadband facility could be constructed and;

· Provide land management agencies with cooperative agreement and fee retention authority for telecommunications rights-of-way to leverage public lands for broadband deployment.###==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) along with Democratic Chairman Joe Crowley (D-NY), Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), and Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA) released the following statements after holding a press conference voicing opposition to President Trump's Secretary of Labor nominee, Andy Puzder. Andy Puzder has made a name for himself by peddling the idea that minimum wage hikes would force fast food companies to replace workers with robots and has consistently opposed attempts to raise wages for individuals living below the poverty line."Andy Puzder has consistently stood on the side of big business and failed to support workers,"Rep. Mark Pocan said."Since 2004, the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division found Puzder's businesses committed over 1,000 violations. Being Secretary of Labor is about making sure working men and women of this country are treated with decency. The nomination of Andy Puzder is another broken promise to the American people. President Trump likes to talk and tweet about putting hard-working Americans first, but at the end of the day, he wants to make sure only big business and special interests have seats at the table.""Andy Puzder is exactly the opposite of who we want running the Department of Labor,"Congressman Joe Crowley said."There is no doubt in my mind that as Labor Secretary, he would consistently back the interests of corporations above the interests of working families. I've long fought for a higher minimum wage and better protections for working Americans – the very things Andy Puzder has made a career working against. American working families need better than Andy Puzder.""The American people deserve a Secretary of Labor who can be counted on to enforce wage and hour laws, workplace safety protections, and workers' civil rights,"said Congressman Bobby Scott."In light of Mr. Puzder's record, he has failed to carry the burden of proving that he will vigorously and effectively enforce the very laws his company has been found to violate. Therefore, the Senate HELP Committee has no choice but to reject his nomination.""President Trump promised to serve the American worker in his inaugural address, yet in nominating Mr. Puzder to lead the Department of Labor, the American worker would be betrayed. Mr. Puzder has an extensive record of engaging in marketing tactics that degrade women, fighting against paying workers their hard earned overtime, opposing expansion of the Affordable Care Act, and even allegedly failing to pay some of his workers,"said Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro."Mr. Puzder is the wrong choice to lead the Department of Labor and the Senate should not confirm him.""Of all the cruel jokes played by President Trump on the working people who voted for him, the nomination of Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor is the cruelest yet,"said Congressman DeSaulnier."Mr. Puzder has a proven record of exploiting his employees by making 487 times more than his lowest wage worker while refusing to pay a living wage; withholding overtime pay; favoring automation over working people; and running a chain of restaurants where 60 percent of the establishments where found to be in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These actions should automatically disqualify Mr. Puzder from running the Department of Labor. So much for helping the 150 million working families that depend on the Department to protect them.""Working people need a champion at the Labor Department,"said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre."At best, Andy Puzder is an adversary. At worst, he is an enemy. We simply cannot afford to have a Labor Secretary who does not respect workers. We are opposing his nomination with the full weight of the labor movement."

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in opposition to President Trump's dangerous, hasty, and ill-informed Executive Order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. President Trump's actions stand in opposition to our country's most deeply held values and traditions, and raise further questions about the conflicted role of his business interests when making policy decisions."I am outraged by President Trump's unconstitutional Executive Order, which uses hateful, divisive tactics to scapegoat and discriminate against refugees and citizens of certain Muslim nations,"Rep. Pocan stated."President Trump is attempting to jam his divisive campaign trail rhetoric into policies which ignore the public, the Constitution and Congress. Across the United States, the people have spoken, marching in the streets and calling on their elected leaders to oppose these actions. It is time for President Trump to stand up for our nation's shared values and represent all Americans."The outsized involvement of unqualified and extreme advisors in our national security policy, including White Nationalist champion Steve Bannon, raise serious questions about how President Trump is making these vital decisions, Bannon's role in the drafting of this and other Executive Orders, in addition to the decision to give him a seat on the National Security Council while demoting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence, set a dangerous precedent."I stand alongside the people of my district and will explore a number of means of fighting against this prejudice and division. I offer my office as a resource of support for residents and visitors to our district who experience problems. You are not alone."

Rep. Pocan is an original cosponsor of legislation to prohibit federal funding from being used to implement this executive order and will continue to work with colleagues in Congress and constituents in Wisconsin to ensure the rights of all individuals coming to our country are respected.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and First Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) issued the following statement after the Trump administration announced plans to sign executive orders that would impose severe limitations on immigration and refugees. The executive orders will limit access for refugees who come from predominantly Muslim countries and allow for the construction of a border wall."As Americans we are best when we hold our values close. We value the freedom to practice one's religion without persecution, the freedom of self-determination, the freedom to build a good life for oneself and one's family – these values are non-negotiable. But President Trump, and the Republicans who support him, are acting as if our shared beliefs, set forth in the Constitution, can be tossed aside."We are stronger when our decisions reflect our shared values of inclusion and equality. We are safer when we unite against actual threats. Demonizing people in search of a better life only increases ill-will towards us around the world. Forcing local jurisdictions by presidential mandate to assist with civil immigration enforcement will break faith with immigrant communities only to sow fear and mistrust. Militarizing the southern border and making immigration detention mandatory will only waste exorbitant amounts of taxpayer money and ensure vulnerable people continue to live in fear."Refugees, by definition, are those fleeing persecution – not persecutors themselves. Closing our borders to refugees fleeing devastation and war is morally indefensible. It's cruel and it's un-American."Later this year, Congress will have an opportunity to block these discriminatory policies. The CPC hopes that colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us using the power of the purse to stop these attacks on our fundamental values."This isn't just campaign rhetoric anymore. It's policy. And it may endanger people's lives."# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after President Trump signed an executive order this morning to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)."The defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a testament to the power of grassroots organizing. A large coalition of labor unions, human rights organizations, and environmental and consumer advocacy groups joined together with Members of Congress to successfully fight against the TPP, which benefited multi-national corporations at the expense of the hard-working Americans."U.S. trade policy must create good-paying jobs here at home, reduce the trade deficit, expand access to affordable prescription drugs, and protect human rights. Whether President Trump's trade policies will meet these standards or not remains to be seen. I will continue to hold the Administration accountable to ensure that our trade deals benefit working families not big corporations. It's time we give up the failed trade policies of the past and adopt a new 21st century trade framework to grow American jobs and protect U.S. consumers."# # #==

Mark Pocan (D-WI), David Cicilline (D-RI), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Jared Polis (D-CO) and Mark Takano (D-CA), Co-Chairs of theCongressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today sent aletterto members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) urging them to closely examine Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos' views on issues affecting LGBT students and parents during her confirmation process."It is unfathomable that the next Secretary of Education would oppose basic protections for LGBT students and roll back the progress we have made to ensure all students feel safe and supported in our schools,"said Rep. Pocan. "Ms. DeVos' history of opposing equality for LGBT individuals is deeply troubling, and the public deserves to know whether she will work with us to improve lives or continue to advocate an extremist agenda that bullies our students."

Theletterspecifically highlights the millions of dollars DeVos and her family have contributed to organizations and candidates that oppose equality for LGBT families and actively promote dangerous practices like "conversion therapy." Rep. Pocan and his colleagues called on Senate HELP Committee members to demand Ms. DeVos denounce these inhumane positions and stand up for policies to protect LGBT students and parents before being confirmed.

Below is the text of the letter and you can find a digital copy of the letterhere.

Dear Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray:

As Co-Chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, we write to express our deep concern with President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the Secretary of the United States Department of Education, Betsy DeVos. While Ms. DeVos' stances on a number of public education issues raise concerns, we cannot hold our silence regarding her opposition to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students.

Betsy DeVos' career has been marked by repeated attempts to undermine the rights of the LGBT community. She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo "conversion" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next Secretary of Education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the Secretary of Education.

Since 1998, Betsy DeVos and her family's foundations have donated at least $6.1 million to Focus on the Family, a right-wing organization which has spent millions of dollars attempting to defeat marriage equality amendments at the state level. Even more troubling, this organization supported by the DeVos family promotes "conversion therapy," opposes the right of LGBT parents to adopt children, and has referred to transgender individuals as "mentally ill." This organization has even gone so far to oppose anti-bullying policies and opposes basic workplace protections for LGBT individuals. The DeVos family's support for anti-LGBT groups and policies extends beyond just this organization to many other groups known for their anti-LGBT activities, such as:

• $1,000,000 to the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, which has claimed that the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act amounted to a "fatwa;"
• $15,000 to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has opposed adoption with same-sex couples;
• $433,750 to the Council for National Policy, a highly secretive group that is led by extremists like Focus on the Family's James Dobson among other extremists; and
• $13,498,000 to the Heritage Foundation, which has stated that "Despite activist judges' opinions, the majority of Americans continue to affirm the reasonable conclusion that marriage is the union of one man and one woman."

The DeVos family does not stop with contributions to intolerant organizations as they also support anti-LGBT politicians. For example, the DeVos family - including Ms. DeVos - were top contributors to Michigan State Representative Andrea LaFontaine, who sponsored legislation allowing adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT parents and deny them the ability to adopt a child.

The LGBT community has made significant and long overdue advancements when it comes to equality in education. During President Obama's tenure in office, the Department of Education took important steps to combat bullying and ensure that Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, appropriately reflects the rights of transgender students. It is imperative that the rights of LGBT students are adequately protected moving forward.

As you move to consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos, we strongly encourage you to seek out answers regarding Ms. DeVos' stance on important education equity issues, including her views on protecting LGBT students from bullying and discrimination in K-12 and higher education spaces. We are particularly troubled by Betsy DeVos' past support for inhumane "conversion therapy" treatments and believe it is imperative that any Secretary of Education nominee denounce such practices before being confirmed.

As Members of the LGBT community, we know our schools must be a safe place for all children. As you consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, we strongly encourage you to stand up for the civil rights of LGBT students and ensure the next Secretary opposes any action to roll back our progress toward equality.==

Now it's time to see where House Republicans stand. Will they join Democrats in protecting these critically important programs? Or will they break President-Elect Trump's promise to the American people and double down on their plan to end Medicare as we know it, threaten nursing home coverage for millions of seniors, undermine comprehensive health care for children by cutting Medicaid, and slash benefits earned through a lifetime of hard work?"A copy of the CPC "No Benefit Cuts" amendment can be foundhere.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) led aletterwith 23 House Democrats to Majority Leader McConnell, Leader-elect Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Leader Pelosi urging immediate action in the upcoming Congress to expand economic opportunities in communities harmed by the outsourcing of American jobs."The frustration and despair felt by workers in our region is palpable, and the discourse during the year's election detailing the lack of opportunity for the working class underscores the need for solutions to these challenges. Congress has a responsibility to address their concerns and work together to strengthen the economic stability of these communities," the letter states.

The text of the letter is below and an electronic copy can be foundhere.

Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader-elect Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Leader Pelosi:

We write today to urge immediate action in the 115th Congress to expand economic opportunity in communities harmed by the outsourcing of American jobs.

Our states encompass communities that once served as thriving hubs for manufacturing and development, providing the opportunity for working class families to achieve the American Dream. In recent decades, the livelihoods of these workers have been pulled out from beneath them. We have watched too many factories shutter their doors and too many workers lose their jobs, decimating these neighborhoods and leaving families behind.

The frustration and despair felt by workers in our region is palpable, and the discourse during the year's election detailing the lack of opportunity for the working class underscores the need for solutions to these challenges. Congress has a responsibility to address their concerns and work together to strengthen the economic stability of these communities.

For these reasons, we urge Congress to prioritize the consideration and passage of legislation consistent with the following principles:

1. We should close loopholes in our tax code which reward companies that ship jobs overseas and punish companies that stay in the United States and invest in American workers.

2. Federal contracting and procurement policies should give preference to American labor and domestic-made goods so our taxpayer dollars benefit working class families in the United States.

3. We should increase investments in education and prepare workers for careers in advanced manufacturing and other industries that will be pivotal in the 21st century economy.

4. Trade Adjustment Assistance and retraining programs should be improved and expanded to give workers the opportunity to get back on their feet when confronting job displacement.

5. We should expand access to quality broadband services and increased telecommunications connectivity so all communities have the digital resources that are necessary to compete in our digital economy.

6. The promise of a secure retirement must be upheld by preserving benefits that workers have paid into and earned, including Social Security, Medicare, and workplace pension guarantees.

Too many working class families in our districts have been left behind because of the outsourcing of American jobs. It is critical Congress takes immediate action to jumpstart the economic prosperity of these communities by passing legislation that adheres to the principles listed above.

We hope you will stand with us and our constituents during the 115th Congress to advance these goals and revive the American Dream for workers across the country.# # #==

Madison – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement today after President-elect Trump nominated Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon Mobil, as Secretary of State.

“President-elect Trump’s nomination of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, as Secretary of State, signals that US diplomacy is now in the pockets of big oil. Tillerson has spent his entire career putting the profits of Exxon over our country’s national interests.

“Not only does Tillerson have billions of dollars at stake with sanctions on Russia, his company has been under a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for inaccurate accounting practices that affect global climate regulations. Our country needs a Secretary of State who will guide US foreign policy with a steady hand, not place profit margins ahead of diplomacy.”

Title: Rep. Pocan Leads Letter to President-elect Trump Highlighting Republicans’ Divisions Over Buy America Requirements

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) sent aletterto President-elect Trump asking him to enforce and expand the Buy America Act, and also highlighting Congressional Republican leadership’s opposition to requirements that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers. Rep. Pocan and his colleagues also expressed concern over current loopholes and lax enforcement of the Buy America Act, particularly those related to shipbuilding.

“If President-elect Trump is concerned with livelihood of American workers, he should take steps to ensure the Buy America Act is strongly and meaningfully enforced,”said Rep. Pocan. “Last week, House Republican leadership removed a provision to permanently require American steel and iron be used in our country’s water infrastructure. It is unthinkable for House Republicans to eliminate these Buy America requirements after they were voted on and passed by the Senate. President-elect Trump can and should ensure that enforcement of the Act is strengthened. It is his duty to stand up to Congressional Republican leadership when the allow taxpayer dollars to go to companies that ship jobs overseas.”

“Wisconsin has one of the highest percentages of its workforce employed in the manufacturing sector,”continued Rep. Pocan. “Foundries across the state are scratching their heads wondering why Republicans would want to send taxpayer dollars to companies that ship jobs overseas. House Republicans claim to care about keeping jobs here in America, yet consistently rally around legislation that costs our country jobs. I hope President-elect Trump will ensure what happened to the Water Resources bill doesn’t happen again- we need a firm commitment from both parties to buy American.”

Rep. Pocan was joined by 20 of his colleagues on theletter; they were Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Frederica S. Wilson (D-FL), Donald Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), Gwen S.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Next Generation Researchers Act passed the House & Senate as part of the 21stCentury Cures Act. The Next Generation Researchers Act directs the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote and provide new opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence.

“I was proud to see the Next Generation Researchers Act pass the House & Senate as part of the 21stCentury Cures Act today,”Rep. Pocan said.“This bill reaffirms our commitment to help early career researchers and young innovators pursue their research and ensures the U.S. continues to be the global leader in science research and development. With one of the country’s greatest research universities in my own District, I have heard directly from graduate researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the need for investment, coordination and promotion of policies focused on the future of the research workforce in the United States. By providing our young scientists and researchers with more funding opportunities and focused policies they have the support necessary to tackling the challenges of tomorrow. I want to thank Senator Baldwin for her work on this initiative and the countless advocates who worked to get this legislation passed.”

The legislation authorizes NIH to establish a “Next Generation of Researchers Initiative” within the NIH Office of the Director to develop and coordinate policies and programs related to young scientists, such as funding opportunities, training and mentorship programs, and policies to enhance workforce diversity. It also funds a study by the National Academies of Science to review career barriers for biomedical researchers, which the NIH will subsequently use to continue to focus and pursue effectively policies promoting the future of the research workforce."We are deeply grateful to Congressman Pocan for his dedication and leadership in advancing the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes the Next Generation Researchers Act, which he authored to ensure that we continue our progress in biomedical research,"said Robert Golden, Dean of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health."This legislation provides critical support for the development of young researchers, many of whom are working on new cures and therapies right here in Wisconsin.”

“As a world class research institution, UW-Madison is home to many researchers who are early in their careers and can benefit from the passage of the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are extremely grateful to Representative Pocan for introducing this legislation and shepherding it through bipartisan approval as an investment in the next generation of researchers,”said Marsha Mailick, UW-Madison’s Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education.“Our researchers in the growing biomedical and behavioral research areas are eager for opportunities like this initiative, which seeks to enhance training, provide mentorship programs, and jump start much needed funding for those early in their careers who have great potential to conduct transformative research at UW-Madison.”

“Ensuring young researchers have opportunities to pursue their dreams and contribute to faster medical progress is crucial to sustaining our global competitiveness in the life sciences arena, and to the national imperative of faster medical progress,”said Mary Wooley, President and CEO of Research! America.“The inclusion of the “NextGen” Act in the 21stCentury Cures bill will help ensure those opportunities proliferate. We are grateful to Representative Pocan, Senator Baldwin, Senator Collins, and the bill’s other champions for their vision and leadership in championing this strategically important initiative.”

“The Next Generation Research Act will enhance career opportunities for younger researchers in the biological and biomedical sciences,”saidHoward Garrison, Director of Public Affairs of Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).“We are grateful for Representative Pocan’s support for the biomedical research community and are pleased that this important legislation was included in the 21stCentury Cures Act.”

Rep. Pocan introduced the Next Generations Researches Act in September 2015 and Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced companion bill in the Senate. Rep. Pocan previously introduced this legislation in the 113thCongress as well.# # #==

• Rep. Duffy claimed only Dane County was doing a hand recount, but the state Elections Commission says 47 counties are conducting hand recounts and another 13 are doing partial hand recounts.
• Communism is defined as an economic and political theory where all property and businesses are publically owned, but Dane County is responsible for 73% of the new jobs created in Wisconsin in the last decade.
• Monica Moorehead the 2016 Workers World Party presidential candidate received 175 votes out of the more than 300,000 cast in Dane County.
• Rep. Duffyhas offeredto send anyone in Madison who was offended by his comments a therapy dog to their “safe place” of choice. Yet he has not provided any details as to how his office plans to facilitate the transportation of so many dogs to the Madison area, nor has he specified what breed(s) of dog.

“I understand Rep. Duffy doesn’t want to appear weak by apologizing, but I want to make sure he at least has some facts next time he decides to shoot his mouth off on Fox News. Facts sometimes even matter there,”said Rep. Pocan.==

“I represent more than 700,000 people in Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District. Madison, the heart of Dane County, is one of the leading economic drivers in our state and the county is responsible for 73% of the new jobs created in Wisconsin in the last decade. His insinuation that my constituents are somehow un-American for exercising their political views is extremely alarming. At a time when our country stands divided, Congressman Duffy’s ‘Trumpizing’ of Wisconsin is the wrong direction for our state.

“The Wisconsin delegation has a reputation for cooperation and respect. For Rep. Duffy to try and drive divisions among Wisconsinites is unconscionable. On behalf of my constituents, I demand an apology from Rep. Duffy and hope the Wisconsin delegation will condemn his comments as they are far from the Wisconsin values we hold dear.”

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after President-elect Trump nominated Steven Mnuchin as Secretary of the Department of the Treasury:

“During his campaign, Donald Trump railed against Wall Street cronies for their excessive political influence, but his nomination of Steve Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs exec, as Secretary of the Treasury proves that his administration will be directly in the pocket of Wall Street. He capitalized on the suffering of families facing foreclosure during the financial crisis, prioritizing his own profits above the livelihoods of working class Americans.

“Mnuchin has repeatedly praised the risky tactics used by Wall Street bankers that caused the economic collapse. And he has continually targeted vulnerable populations and discriminated against minority groups in his drive to make a profit, including recently facing federal complaints over unfair lending practices.

“A man who got rich off the backs of working families during the foreclosure crisis should not be allowed anywhere near our financial regulatory system. President-elect Trump continues to show his administration only cares about the interests of Wall Street at the expense of hard-working American families.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) is calling on President Obama to take all steps necessary to protect those enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) programs after President-elect Trump reiterated his support to deport undocumented people.

“Undocumented immigrants trusted that when they enrolled in the DACA and DAPA programs they would be able to live and work legally without fear of deportation,”Rep. Pocan said. “However, President-elect Trump continues to make sweeping claims about dismantling these programs and deporting families who have been living and working in the United States for years. I strongly urge President Obama to take all necessary means to protect those enrolled in the DACA and DAPA programs.”

In November 2014, President Obama announced executive orders that would allow certain undocumented immigrants to live and work in the United State legally. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program allows young people who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable work permit and exemption from deportation. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program granted deferred action status to parents of American citizens or lawful permanent residents.

These programs were subsequently halted by a court injunction after several states sued the federal government. In June 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s injunction in a deadlocked 4-4 decision. As of the end of June 2016, about742,000 Dreamershad received DACA status.# # #==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Stefanik Introduce Bipartisan Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program Act
Date: November 17, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC– Today, Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI-02) and Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21) introduced H.R. 6336 -- the bipartisanBroadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program (B-CROP) Actto increase internet connectivity in rural communities through a combination of grants and loans. This legislation is a companion bill to one introduced by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) earlier this fall.

“In a 21st century economy, our businesses and families need access to broadband so we can compete around the globe,”said Congresswoman Stefanik.“This important legislation would provide greater resources to build this infrastructure in the North Country and in rural areas across our nation. I am pleased to join Congressman Pocan to introduce this bipartisan legislation in the House, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical 21st century infrastructure project.”

“Access to reliable, high-speed internet service is vital to communities across America especially to small businesses and students,” Rep. Mark Pocan said. “Yet, in rural areas, including parts of my district in Wisconsin, over a third of the population doesn’t have access to quality broadband. The Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Program (B-CROP) Act will increase resources to update and expand broadband infrastructure. I’m proud to work with Congresswoman Stefanik to help close the broadband gap so all communities can have a reliable connection.”

Nationally, more than 55 million Americans lack access to advanced broadband speeds and an even greater number lack even basic connectivity. Broadband internet for rural communities serves as a crucial economic engine to generate widely shared prosperity. Therefore the push toward developing a 21st century infrastructure for America is quickly emerging as an initiative with bipartisan consensus.

This legislation helps connect rural communities by:

• Allowing for grants of up to 50 percent of a project’s cost, and up to 75 percent for remote, high-need areas, to be awarded in combination with the current loan funding available through USDA’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS).

• Combining grants with loans, the bill helps enhance the economic feasibility of projects serving rural and tribal areas.

• Providing highest priority to projects that serve areas that are currently unserved by high-speed broadband.

• This legislation also increases the authorized funding for RUS’s Broadband programs to $50 million per fiscal year.

• This proposal would provide adequate resources to private sector providers, including corporations, LLCs, cooperatives or mutual organizations, state or local government, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations to expand broadband access to unserved rural areas. Partnership projects would be given special attention including initiatives that leverage matching funds and that work with anchor institutions like health centers, colleges, universities, and other educational entities, and libraries.

Title: DOJ to Deploy Personnel to Wisconsin to Monitor Elections

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – In response to aformal requestfrom Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Congressmen Ron Kind (D-WI) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced today that its Civil Rights Division plans to deploy resources to Wisconsin for tomorrow’s general election. Congresswoman Moore and Congressman Pocan responded to this announcement with the following statement:

“I take great comfort in knowing that personnel from the U.S. Justice Department will be on the ground in Milwaukee during this historic election,” said Congresswoman Moore. “Too many Wisconsinites, especially those in communities of color, face a host of unnecessary obstacles in their efforts exercise their constitutional right to vote. This is simply unacceptable. My colleagues and I in Wisconsin’s Democratic congressional delegation would like to thank the DOJ for ensuring that all voters, regardless of party affiliation or political ideology, have the right to take part in our democracy, free of discrimination or intimidation.”

“The decision by the Department of Justice, while welcome, is a bittersweet victory for those of us who want to ensure voting rights are upheld,” said Congressman Pocan. “Although the DOJ’s efforts to enforce federal voting-rights laws is essential to fending off the worst aspects of this relentless attack on the right to vote, my colleagues and I will fight to end the suppression and intimidation that have become normalized in this election. The bedrock of democracy is the robust participation of all of us in the political process—this has always been a core Wisconsin value. We cannot and will not tolerate the continued threat of disenfranchisement against hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites.”

In an op-ed published earlier today, Congresswoman Moore and Congressman Pocan outlined their motivation behind the request to the DOJ and underscored how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in serious jeopardy.

Title: Rep. Mark Pocan, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, and Reps. Ron Kind & Gwen Moore Urge DOJ to Assist in Overseeing Wisconsin’s Elections
Date: October 26, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Reps. Ron Kind (D-WI) and Gwen Moore (D-WI), sent aletterto the Department of Justice requesting assistance in overseeing Wisconsin’s monitoring of the election, including providing poll-monitoring services in the state. The request was spurred by Wisconsin’s contentious and discriminatory Voter ID Law and a political environment that has become increasingly intimidating for voters.

“We have continued to see how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in real jeopardy,”the Members of Congress write. “Given the flawed efforts thus far by state officials to properly implement this law, with proof of demonstrably false information having been disseminated to voters just days before the election, we fear that irreparable harm may result—particularly to voters of color, who disproportionately bear the brunt of these policies and any Election Day intimidation efforts. We ask the Department to provide any resources or assistance it can in order to help our state navigate these unsettling circumstances.”

The full text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be foundhere.

Dear Attorney General Lynch,

As you are aware, Wisconsin, which we represent, is among 14 states that have adopted new voter restrictions in advance of the November 8th election. The state’s 2011 voter identification law, one of the strictest in the country, has been repeatedly challenged in federal court due to its discriminatory effects on vulnerable populations’ voting rights. Due to the law’s contentious nature and poor implementation, coupled with a political environment that is becoming increasingly intimidating, we are requesting the Department of Justice’s assistance in overseeing the state’s monitoring of the election, including by providing poll-monitoring services in Wisconsin.

In 2014, a U.S. district court noted that more than 300,000 Wisconsinites lacked the newly requisite form of identification, and that this population disproportionately included persons of color. Judge Lynn Adelman further observed that state officials “could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in Wisconsin at any time in the recent past,” casting serious doubt on the official rationale for the policy.

A second federal court determined earlier this summer that even the “safety net” built into the law to help voters who have trouble obtaining ID was a “wretched failure” that “disenfranchised citizens” who are “overwhelmingly African American and Latino.”

Deeming the provision unconstitutional, Judge James Peterson mandated changes in practice and public education to ensure that that process better serves all Wisconsinites with documentation challenges in obtaining identification so they can vote. Concurring with Judge Adelman, Judge Peterson also expressed “misgivings about whether the law actually promotes confidence and integrity,” and observed that prior to 2011, “Wisconsin had an exemplary election system that produced high levels of voter participation without significant irregularities.”

Unfortunately, since that court order in late July, we have continued to see how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in real jeopardy. Over the last month, press reports have revealed that on numerous occasions, Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicle employees provided erroneous and incomplete information to potential voters who are unable to obtain IDs due to a lack of required documentation (like a birth certificate), despite their eligibility for alternative credentials.

These revelations led Judge Peterson to remark on October 12, “I'm very disappointed to see that the state really did nothing in response to my order,” noting that voters are “at the mercy of the DMV, and its staff wasn't trained well enough to guide people through it.” We are deeply troubled by the prospect of such misinformation contributing to voter disenfranchisement in this election. While further scrutiny by the federal court has prompted state officials to institute additional training and public education efforts at the DMV, there is entirely too much at stake in the limited time left before the election to let this continue without additional oversight.

In addition to misinformation, we are also concerned about potential voter intimidation at the polling places, particularly in light of recent, high-profile rhetoric that alleges “election rigging.” National figures have suggested that there is widespread voter fraud in our country and have encouraged private citizens to monitor the voting behaviors of certain communities for potential misconduct.

Given the flawed efforts thus far by state officials to properly implement this law, with proof of demonstrably false information having been disseminated to voters just days before the election, we fear that irreparable harm may result—particularly to voters of color, who disproportionately bear the brunt of these policies and any Election Day intimidation efforts.

We ask the Department to provide any resources or assistance it can in order to help our state navigate these unsettling circumstances. For example, the Department has historically provided poll monitors on Election Day to help ensure that all eligible voters will be permitted to register and exercise their fundamental right to participate in our democracy. We therefore urge the Department of Justice to utilize any available election monitoring resources to ensure voters in Wisconsin are able to safely access the polls.

The right to elect our public representatives is unrivaled in its importance to a fully functioning democracy. With few days remaining until the election, it is imperative that we do everything in our power to limit the amount of harm caused to our state’s voters.

Thank you for your consideration of this request and for the Department of Justice’s ongoing efforts to ensure the fairness of all elections in our country.# # #==
Title: Pocan Applauds $50.5 Million DOL Grants to Expand Apprenticeships as Sec. Perez Plans to Make Announcement at Madison College Today
Date: October 21, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) applauded the United States Department of Labor’s $50.5 million dollar investment to expand apprenticeships. TheApprenticeshipUSAgrants will go to 37 states for the purpose of expanding apprenticeship and meeting the national goal set by President Obama to double the number of apprentices. United States Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez is scheduled to highlight the investment in Wisconsin, totaling $1.5 million, at Madison College later this morning.

“I applaud the Obama Administration and Secretary Perez for the emphasis they have placed on expanding apprenticeships with these grants,”said Rep. Mark Pocan.“Wisconsin has been a leader in apprenticeship training since 1911, when we established the nation's first apprenticeship law, so it is fitting that Secretary Perez will announce these grants in the Badger state.”

“It’s critical for us to support the development of more apprenticeship programs across the spectrum of industries in order to prepare more highly skilled workers for in-demand occupations,”continued Rep. Pocan.“We must provide workers and job seekers with better access to employment, education, training, and support programs to help them secure good, well-paying jobs.”

“Under the Obama administration we’ve partnered with Congress, state and local officials, employers, educators, community organizations, and the workforce system to add 125,000 new apprentices since 2014, the largest increase in nearly a decade,”said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. “The ApprenticeshipUSA grants announced today will help continue this momentum and put apprenticeship front and center to develop the career-ready workforce that businesses need to compete in our global economy and deliver the skills that workers need to thrive on the job.”

Since becoming a Member of Congress in January 2013, Congressman Pocan has been a leader on the expansion of apprenticeship. He authored theLEARNS Act, and has encouraged appropriators to include funding to expand apprenticeships. More than 90 percent of apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $60,000. There is also a substantial return on investment for employers — international studies suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers may get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity and greater front-line innovation. Unfortunately, the Republican House FY2017 Budget terminates future funding for this program.###==
Title: Rep. Pocan Urges President Obama to Take Executive Action to Lower Prescription Drug Prices
Date: October 12, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) along with 33 House Democrats, sent aletterto President Obama urging him to take executive action to reign in the dramatic increase in costs for prescription medications. In the letter, the members note that since 2011, prices for four of the nation’s top 10 drugs rose more than 100 percent and the cost of the other six most commonly used prescription medications went up more than 50 percent. These price hikes are restricting and preventing Americans’ access to critical drugs.

“Americans deserve reliable access to safe and affordable prescription drugs. While drug company profits continue to increase at a faster pace than any other sector of the health care industry, too many working families are being squeezed by skyrocketing drug prices,”Rep. Pocan said.“The President should use his executive authority to end pharmaceutical companies’ monopoly on drug pricing and ensure that Americans don’t have to worry about how they will pay for lifesaving prescriptions.”

"Drug prices are too high, forcing millions of Americans to choose between their financial health and their physical health. But, as Rep. Pocan and the signers of his letter point out, President Obama can take executive action to lower drug prices,”said Alex Lawson, Executive Director, Social Security Works.“We urge him to do so immediately."

A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that almost 75% of Americans believe drug costs are unreasonable and a majority of Americans (including Republicans) support a variety of government actions to limit pharmaceutical companies increasing drug prices to benefit their own bottom line.

The letter was signed by Reps. Keith Ellison (D-MN), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Jared Huffman (D-CA), Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Sam Farr (D-CA), Gwen S. Moore (D-WI), John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), Earl Blumenauer (D- OR), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Maxine Waters (D-CA), Steve Cohen (D-TN), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), John Yarmuth (D-KY), Donna Edwards (D-MD), Emanuel Cleaver(D-MO), Peter Welch (D-VT), Louise M. Slaughter (D-NY), Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), John Garamendi (D-CA), and Don Beyer (D-VA).

The letter is also endorsed by Social Security Works, CREDO Action, People Demanding Action, the Other 98%, Courage Campaign, Progressive Congress, Blue America, Public Citizen, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), Daily Kos, Public Leadership Institute, People’s Action, Democracy for America, the Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, Communication Workers of America (CWA), National Physicians Alliance, Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, MoveOn, and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).

The text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be foundhere.

Dear President Obama:

We write to express our concern regarding the dramatic increase in costs for prescription medications and commend your continued commitment to decreasing the costs of health care without reducing quality for millions of Americans. In fact, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the rate of uninsured Americans to below 9 percent, the lowest rate on record. However, the federal government has yet to seriously address the alarming rise in the price of prescription drugs, which makes up nearly 20 percent of total health care costs in the United States. We urge your administration to use executive action and take concrete steps now to enable more Americans have access to affordable prescription drugs.

In the past five years, patients have seen multiple pharmaceutical corporations participate in the cruel practice of price gouging: preventing Americans from accessing lifesaving drugs in order to maximize their profits. Recently, Gilead Sciences set a price of $84,000 for Solvaldi, their 12-week Hepatitis C treatment, restricting patient access to the life-changing drug in order to maximize their profits. Additionally, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which purchased Daraprim, a drug used to treat a rare disease and AIDS patients, drastically hiked the price by 5,000 percent from $13.50 to $750 per pill. Unfortunately, Turing is not alone. Pharmaceutical corporations are buying rights to older drugs with limited competition in the market and then quickly increasing prices several times over a short period of time. The most recent example of the pharmaceutical industries’ price-gouging and anti-competitive behavior is Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Mylan increased the price of the EpiPen, an auto-injector of epinephrine for patients with severe allergies who are at-risk of anaphylaxis, by over 480 percent in the United States over 5 years. This practice has restricted families’ and emergency medical providers’ access to this lifesaving product.

Unfortunately, the tactics used by pharmaceutical companies have an outsized impact on low- and middle-income families and seniors. We have all heard too many stories from our constituents about families who are forced to choose between buying groceries, paying their mortgage or getting medication their child desperately needs.

Since 2011, prices for four of the nation’s top 10 drugs rose more than 100 percent and the other six went up more than 50 percent. Pharmaceutical companies are restricting, or even worse, preventing Americans’ access to critical drugs for the sake of their own profits. As Congress pursues multiple legislative strategies aimed at ending the pharmaceutical price gouging behavior, we also urge you engage in efforts to address this through executive action. With continued Republican obstruction of necessary legislation, we need your leadership to prevent harm to millions of families hurt by soaring prices for the medicines they need.

We believe your Administration should issue fair and transparent guidelines to ensure the public has access to lifesaving drugs developed using federally funded research. Specifically, you should instruct the Director of the National Institutes of Health to ensure that drugs researched and developed with taxpayer funds are kept accessible to the public by authorizing new competition for unaffordable, monopoly-priced medications—an existing statutory power granted by the Bayh-Dole Act (Pub. L. 96-517). This is an important step in deterring corporations from holding federally funded patented drugs from setting unreasonable prices.

Moreover, we also encourage your administration to explore implementing drug importation rules that are already part of U.S. law. Under authority from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can certify the importation of prescription drugs from other countries under specific qualifications. This regulatory action would pose no risk to public health and safety and could result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription drugs to American families.

We believe your administration also has the authority to address issues within the Federal Trade Commission to more effectively combat monopolies held by pharmaceutical companies and the use of patent settlements to block all other generic drug competition for a growing number of branded drugs, also known as “pay-for-delay.” We are deeply concerned that pharmaceutical companies will continue this unethical and unlawful practice until necessary reforms are developed and implemented.

In any given month, about half of all Americans and 90 percent of seniors take a prescription drug. We strongly encourage you to consider these executive actions to stop the rapid increase in drug prices and ensure affordable consumer access to medication.==
Title: After Gov. Walker Threatens District Attorney Offices, Rep. Pocan Calls on DOJ to Ensure Retaliation Not Occur, May Need to Intervene
Date: September 23, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) sent aletterto the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) calling on the DOJ to ensure district attorney offices remain free of politically motivated retaliation after Gov. Walker threatened district attorney offices. Walker insinuated if Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm and other DA offices continued the “John Doe” investigation, which included the investigation of potential illegal activity during his recall election, that he would carve them out of a proposed increase in funding for local district attorneys’ offices.

“Scott Walker’s threat is unconscionable. Public officials should not use their office to make politically motivated threats and undermine lawful investigations for their political ambitions,”said Rep. Pocan.“Threatening to cut funding for our District Attorney’s office- a much needed public resource- for their work in lawful legal matters which happen to involve the Governor is outrageous and wrong.”

“When the special prosecutor admits he was unaware of the pay-to-play scheme with the billionaire owner of a lead paint manufacturer, it is vital that a lawful investigation be allowed to be considered without the threat of politically motivated retribution,”continued Rep. Mark Pocan. “It is also important to remember that these potential violations of state ethics laws by Walker could still be prosecuted, even though state laws were changed. I urge the Department of Justice to take any necessary steps to ensure the Milwaukee District Attorney’s office and other offices are able to continue this lawful investigation without the threat of politically motivated retribution, and if necessary intervene in the matter itself.”

Gov. Scott Walker’s threat follows legitimate inquiries by the Milwaukee County District Attorney into the questionable fundraising connections between the Governor and Wisconsin Club for Growth, an independent group. Documents recently released by Guardian US raise further questions about Walker’s efforts to raise millions of dollars for the group and highlight the necessity of a thorough investigation. These documents revealed a number of troubling contributions to the organization, including a check with a memo line reading “Because Scott Walker asked.”

Last week, the Special Prosecutor in charge of explaining to the courts why the “John Doe” investigation should move forward said that he was unaware of a law passed by Republican lawmakers that granted immunity to the billionaire owner of NL Industries and other lead manufacturers against compensation for victims of lead-paint poisoning. This was the same billionaire who cut $750,000 worth of donations during the recall election.

Title: Rep. Pocan Introduces Bill to Strengthen Corporate Tax Disclosure and Transparency
Date: September 22, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) introduced theCorporate Transparency and Accountability Actto shed light on tax avoidance and profit shifting activities. This legislation would require the disclosure of country-by-country and bottom line information about companies’ taxes to increase transparency for investors and the general public.

“As corporations continue to dodge taxes by shifting massive profits to overseas tax havens, it is now more important than ever to increase transparency around these actions,”Rep. Pocan said.“My legislation will show exactly where public companies are paying their taxes and engaging in business activity so investors and the general public are able to assess investment risk and identify tax avoidance activities.”

“With nearly two and a half trillion dollars booked offshore and governments cracking down on abusive tax avoidance, shareholders are increasingly at risk from the dearth of information available to them about the tax practices of the companies in which they invest. One needs to look no further than the decision requiring Apple to pay billions in back taxes to understand the growing risk. The bill calls for the kind of transparency that makes markets safer, more stable, and serve the needs of investors,”said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the FACT Coalition.

In June, the Treasury Department issued a rule directing large companies – those with $850 million or more in annual revenue – to provide the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with financial data, including income and taxes paid, broken down by each country in which they operate. While the Treasury Department regulation offers an important step in tackling offshore profit shifting, we must take additional actions to strengthen transparency around multinational business activity.

Under theCorporate Transparency and Accountability Act, all publicly traded companies are directed to include country-by-country financial information in their public Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. This information mirrors the data collected by the IRS about large multinational companies under the Treasury Department’s recent rule, and includes country-by-country income, taxes paid, and indicators of economic activity. The legislation also requires the disclosure of total pre-tax profits and the amount paid in state, federal, and foreign taxes by public companies.

The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX),and Gwen Moore (D-WI). The bill is also endorsed by theFACT CoalitionandGlobal Financial Integrity.==

Title: Pocan Blasts Gov. Walker for Again Delaying Verona Road Project

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after Governor Walker unveiled his 2017-2019 transportation budget request, which would further delay major road expansions including the Verona Road construction project. This is the second time the Verona Road project has been delayed. Previously, construction was scheduled for 2016 and 2017, but was delayed until 2019 and 2020 due to budgetary shortfalls.

“Yet again, Gov. Walker’s budget plan fails to fund critical infrastructure in our state including our roads and bridges,”Rep. Mark Pocan said. “With 71 percent of the state’s roads being rated in poor or mediocre condition, it is absolutely unacceptable that major transportation investments continue to be delayed. This is costing Wisconsin jobs and putting the livelihoods of Wisconsinites at risk. Gov. Walker has once again decided to put his personal ambitions and rigid right-wing ideology ahead of the public safety and prosperity of people across the state.”

According to a troubling 2015 U.S. Department of Transportationreport, a staggering 71 percent of Wisconsin’s roads are rated as being in poor or mediocre condition. This ranks Wisconsin in the bottom four states for road conditions in the country.###==
Title: Pocan Calls on Department of Education to Ensure Proper Oversight of Taxpayer-funded Voucher Schools following GAO Report
Date: September 12, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) called on the Department of Education to take the necessary steps to ensure proper oversight and encourage accountability of taxpayer-funded voucher schools following the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO)reportreleased today. In December of 2014, Rep. Pocan along with Reps. Gwen Moore (D-WI) and Marcia Fudge (D-OH)requestedthe GAO report after advocates for people with disabilities, including the ACLU and Disability Rights Wisconsin, raised concerns that Wisconsin’s voucher program, either tacitly or explicitly, allowed participating taxpayer-funded voucher schools to discriminate against students with disabilities in their admission policies.

“This GAO report confirms our deepest concerns about taxpayer-funded voucher schools,”said Rep. Pocan.“We already know voucher and many charter school programs lack the same levels of accountability and transparency as our public schools, but what this study proves is that many of these schools are also failing to meet the needs of special needs students and in many cases discriminating against them.”

“Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country are breaking our public education system by depleting funds from public schools and rerouting them to the comparatively few students in private schools,”continued Rep. Pocan. “Unless we reverse this trend, we will be left with an education system that favors taxpayer-funded voucher and charter schools, with low educational standards and discriminatory practices, at the expense of public schools.”

“We cannot justify diverting scarce public funds to finance private school education for a handful of children at the expense of the vast majority of children who attend public schools. Instead, we should focus our efforts on initiatives that will result in the overall improvement of K-12 schools for all of our nation’s children,"said Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Bobby Scott (D-VA). “That is the ultimate promise of public education in America; that all students – regardless of race, ZIP code, or learning ability – deserve the civil rights afforded to them by federal law. This report shows, yet again, that many students enrolled in private schools using public dollars lack the rights and remedies afforded them by the law. Additionally, the report raises serious questions about the program quality of private schools that continue to siphon public dollars, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the GAO to further investigate this issue.”

“Despite the push—made by some states and trumpeted by some running for political office—to expand private school voucher programs and education savings accounts, this nonpartisan GAO report verifies that vouchers and voucher-like schemes don’t work. They don’t help kids who use them, and they harm the schools that serve kids who don’t use them,”said AFT President Randi Weingarten. "This report confirms basic facts we have long known: While public schools have the responsibility for all students, many voucher schools take public funding while picking and choosing students based on their academic and behavioral characteristics. Voucher schools don’t abide by the same academic quality standards as public schools. They blur the lines separating church and state, and drain critical funding away from public schools. Finally, vouchers exacerbate inequity—despite what the politicians, billionaires and billionaire politicians who promote them claim. Let’s end the drive to privatize education and, instead, invest resources in public schools so that all students have access to a high-quality neighborhood school.”

“The latest GAO study further confirms what many educators and parents across the country know: vouchers do not help the students most in need, they ignore the real opportunity gaps that exist in our public schools today, and they fail to improve student achievement,”said NEA President Lily Eskelsen García. “No matter what you call it – school choice or so-called opportunity scholarships – vouchers siphon dollars away from our public schools to fund private schools at taxpayers’ expense with little to no regard for our students. Students’ chances for success should not depend on securing a voucher or living in the right zip code. If we are serious about doing what works for all of our students, we should focus instead on equipping all students for success and closing the opportunity gaps.”

The GAOreportfound that participation in taxpayer-funded voucher programs and education savings accounts has more than doubled in the last five years while taxpayers have increased spending on these untested programs from $400 million dollars five years ago to $859 million dollars today. Taxpayer-funded voucher schools across the country also lack requirements regarding high educational standards for teachers, discriminate against certain students, and can mandate religious requirements for admission-blurring the lines between separation of church and state.

GAO found many schools they studied requested increased guidance from the Department of Education regarding how federal Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) should be used when it comes to servicing taxpayer-funded voucher schools. Among the report’s chief recommendations was a significant need for the Department of Education to clarify funding streams, standards, and services offered by taxpayer funded voucher programs to ensure taxpayers are not footing the bill for programs that aren’t benefiting our children.

This study focused on issues around funding and access for all students, including those with disabilities, but future work is still needed on educational outcomes. You can find a fact sheet regarding the GAO’s reports findingshere.# # #==

MADISON, WI. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after visiting several local cooperative businesses to promote the benefits of this business model and raise awareness of theCongressional Cooperative Business Caucus.

“Cooperatives not only create good paying jobs, they also give employees and local communities an opportunity to be directly involved in business decisions,”Rep. Pocan said. “I’m proud that my District is home to many thriving cooperatives such as the ones I visited today. Earlier this year I launched the bipartisan Congressional Cooperative Business Caucus with Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA) to help policymakers enact co-op friendly legislation. By highlighting successful co-ops in my District and through my work with the Co-Op Caucus, we can promote greater awareness of the cooperative business model.”

Cooperatives can be found in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy from affordable housing, to quality-sourced food, greater access to electricity, banking and credit needs, and for early childhood learning. Dane County, home to 80 cooperatives, has the highest number of co-ops per capita of any county in country.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Richard Hanna (R-NY) leda bipartisan letterto President Obama urging him to direct all federal agencies to prohibit discrimination in federal government contracting and subcontracting based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the business owner.

In the letter, the members write, “There are an estimated 1.4 million LGBT-owned businesses in the United States – in Congressional districts in all 50 states – that represent an untapped well of innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, no protections exist to prohibit discrimination against these businesses in federal procurement.”

The letter was also signed by Reps. Lois Capps (D-CA), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA), David Cicilline (D-RI), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bill Foster (D-IL), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), John Garamendi (D-CA), Alan Grayson (D-FL), Raúl M.

The text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be foundhere.

Dear Mr. President:

As Members of Congress who believe in the right for all to participate fully in our society and economy, we believe it is time to level the playing field in federal contracting so that all LGBT-owned businesses can compete for contracting opportunities without fear of discrimination. We respectfully urge you to direct all federal agencies to prohibit discrimination in federal government contracting and subcontracting based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the business owner.

There are an estimated 1.4 million LGBT-owned businesses in the United States – in Congressional districts in all 50 states – that represent an untapped well of innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, no protections exist to prohibit discrimination against these businesses in federal procurement. The history of discrimination against LGBT individuals by the federal government and lack of any protections for LGBT-owned businesses perpetuate a sense among these businesses that the federal government is not open to them, and among major federal contractors that seeking out LGBT-owned suppliers is not necessary.

LGBT-owned businesses have much to contribute and gain from federal government contracting opportunities. Ensuring that no barriers exist for LGBT-owned businesses in federal contracting will also benefit the federal government and American taxpayers by creating a larger and more visible pool of diverse suppliers who can provide goods and services to the federal government. It will also provide prime federal contractors with more options to find subcontractors that provide good value.

Your Administration has already taken significant steps to ensure there is LGBT equality in federal contracting, particularly as it related to the employees of federal contractors. Now it is time to finish the job and ensure that contractors and subcontractors themselves cannot face discrimination either.

We look forward to working with you to ensure that the federal government is clearly opening its doors for business with the LGBT community.# # #==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) introducedThe Degrees Not Debt Act. This legislation would create a state-federal partnership program with the Department of Education, states, and public colleges or universities in order to ensure college affordability becomes a reality for all Americans.

The bill would reward states which contribute more towards their public university system by providing federal matching dollars to encourage reinvestment.The Degrees Not Debt Actalso requires that secondary costs, such as books and housing, for students living at 350% of the poverty line (approx. $85,000/year for a family of four) are fully met through a combination of work study and financial aid awards. This legislation is a critical step towards making debt-free college a reality for working families.

“With student debt skyrocketing, it’s time to create a sustainable path for students to graduate from college with degrees, not debt. This legislation provides an incentive for states to contribute more towards their public universities, while ensuring tuition costs do not continue to rise exorbitantly,”Rep. Pocan said.“In addition to tuition,The Degrees Not Debt Actwould also cover housing and textbooks for low-income students, which are often an additional cost barrier. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Congressman Ellison so we can help make college affordable and accessible for everyone."

“Today, a college degree is more important than it’s ever been – and going to college has never been more expensive. Public universities used to be affordable for almost every student who wanted to attend,”Rep. Ellison said.“But the cost of getting a higher education, and the crippling loan debt most students are forced to shoulder, makes it harder for millions of young Americans to buy a house, open a business, or start a family. This bill would ensure that the cost of going to college, from tuition to books to campus meal plans, don’t get in anyone’s way.”

“When students walk across the stage on graduation day, they should take their diplomas with them into a brighter future,”continued Rep. Ellison. “That’s a promise every single public college and university should be able to make. Our debt-free college plan will help our schools make that promise. And it’ll help them keep it.”

“Students, particularly those from working class backgrounds and communities of color, have borne the brunt of crippling and counterproductive cuts to public colleges and universities for over three decades,”said Heather McGhee, President of Demos.“The ability to attend and graduate college without debt was once the norm, and returning to that system requires a new federal-state partnership that encourages states to reinvest in public higher education and targets resources at students for whom college has simply become unaffordable. We applaud this effort and believe it is urgently needed in order to renew the promise of affordable and debt-free public college.”

Public colleges and universities rely heavily on state funding to operate and keep the cost of tuition low. In the last decade, state funding for public higher education has declined due to state budget cuts, lingering economic slowdown following the Great Recession of 2008, and other factors. Today, state funding for public institutions remains below the pre-recession average, and according to the think tank Demos, the decline in state support was responsible for almost 80% of the rise in tuition costs between 2001 and 2011.

TheDegrees Not Debt Actwould provide federal grants to public universities in states that have committed to reinvesting state-based revenue in higher education. The bill sets federal matching rates based on how much funding a state provides for public higher education operating support on a per student basis, compared and indexed to the maximum Pell Grant award.

How the Bill Would Work:

Step 1:States agree to participate in the program.

Step 2: A state would receive a federal match grant based on how much the state provides public universities.

Step 3: Public universities commit to meeting the financial needs of students at 350% of the poverty line (families earning approx. $85,000).

Step 4:Public universities commit to keep tuition rates indexed to inflation, with the option to seek a waiver pending extenuating circumstances including years of being locked into previous budget cuts.

Result:Tuition costs would be controlled for students and universities would receive a greater investment from both the state and federal government while ensuring the full financial needs of students at 350% of the poverty line are met.

The legislation is also supported by the following groups: AFL-CIO, Americans for Democratic Action, Coalition on Human Needs, Daily Kos, National Education Association (NEA), MoveOn, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Young Invincibles, Economic Policy Institute, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), and Demos.# # #==
Title: Pocan, Kildee Call on Volkswagen to Negotiate First Contract with UAW
Date: July 13, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) leda letterto Volkswagen Group of America President and CEO Christian Koch and Executive Vice President of Human Resources Sebastian Pata expressing disappointment in the company’s refusal to bargain with the skilled trades employees at the Chattanooga plant who voted overwhelmingly for a union.

Previously, Volkswagen had remained neutral in unionization votes. However, after the skilled unit voted to form a union in 2015, the company sought to invalidate the election. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reviewed the election results, and it found that the skilled trades employees were qualified to join their own union and had successfully voted to do so. Since the election, the company has been trying to overturn the NLRB’s decision via the courts.

“We do not believe it is in Volkswagen’s interest to prolong this fight against the skilled trades’ election results in court. It is definitely not in the interest of the workers,”Reps. Pocan and Kildee said.“Instead of forum shopping for a different outcome, we urge the company to recognize the workers’ right to form a union, comply with U.S. labor law, and begin collective bargaining with the UAW today.”

The letter was also signed by Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC), Pete Aguilar (D-CA), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Sanford Bishop (D-GA), Robert Brady (D-PA), Cheri Bustos (D-IL), G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), Judy Chu (D-CA), Wm. Lacy Clay (D-MO), Emanuel Cleaver II (D-MO), Steve Cohen (D-TN), John Conyers, Jr (D-MI), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Danny Davis (D-IL), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Elizabeth Etsy (D-CT), Bill Foster (D-IL), Lois Frankel (D-FL), John Garamendi (D-CA), Gene Green (D-TX), Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Sander Levin (D-MI), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Dan Lipinski (D-IL), Dave Loebsack (D-IA), Grace Meng (D-NY), Gwen S.

The text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be foundhere.

Dear Mr. Koch and Mr. Patta,

As elected representatives of Americans from across the country who are deeply concerned about the future of collective bargaining rights as a matter of public policy, we write to express our support for all parties bargaining in good faith and ask that Volkswagen respect the rights of the skilled trades employees at the Volkswagen Chattanooga plant who have elected the United Autoworkers (UAW) to represent them. As a result of the company’s appeal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reviewed the election results, and it found that the skilled trades employees were qualified to join their own union and had successfully voted to do so. In our opinion and as a matter of public policy, we believe that when labor and management bargain in good faith, the best outcomes are realized for all parties.

We are concerned the company has chosen such a tactic against the workers at your Chattanooga plant given the company’s global reputation for supporting and collaborating with its workers. From the beginning, Volkswagen objected to the skilled trades workers’ effort to form a union. Even after the workers won their election, the company challenged the results, which were certified a second time by the NLRB. Now that the company lost its appeal with the NLRB, you have stated your intent to pursue a different result in court. In response to the dilatory tactics, the NLRB issued an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Complaint against Volkswagen on April 26, 2016 (10-CA-166500 and 10-CA-169340), charging the company with violating American law by failing to collectively bargain with the UAW on behalf of the skilled trades workers.

Given the serious nature of the issues involved in this matter and the potential impact they could have on relations between Germany and the United States, we ask that you respond to each of the concerns raised throughout this note. As practitioners of public policy, it’s critical for us to understand the circumstances that might lead some workers’ voices not to be heard.# # #==
Title: Pocan’s Bipartisan Effort to Simplify Application for Student Aid Passes House
Date: July 11, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act of 2016 passed the House. Earlier this year Rep. Pocan and Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) introduced the legislation, which makes President Obama’s executive action to allow for the use of Prior-Prior Year tax data for students permanent – helping students make timely financial decisions about their education.

“This bipartisan legislation is an important step towards making college more affordable and will help streamline the process for students applying to college,”said Rep. Pocan. “Allowing students to use prior years’ tax data means a student can apply for financial aid at the same time they apply for college. This ensures students get information about financial aid, which will help them make their college choice, much earlier.”

SIMPLIFYING THE APPLICATION FOR STUDENT AID ACT:

·Allows students to use family income data from two years prior to the date of the FAFSA application. This process will help students apply for financial aid earlier so they can better prepare for their college costs.

·Improves the ability to link between the online FAFSA form and income tax data stored by the Internal Revenue Service to automatically input income data into the FAFSA form, reducing the need to manually input information that often prevents low-income students from applying for aid.

·Strengthens the integrity of federal financial aid by providing institutions more time to verify the income of their students.

·Additionally, the legislation will also direct the Department of Education to develop a mobile app for the FAFSA. This will allow millions of Americans who do not have broadband access, but do have internet connectivity on their phones to have access to an electronic version of FAFSA.# # #==
Title: Pocan, Welch, Pingree Lead Bipartisan Letter Urging USDA to Increase Broadband Speeds in Rural Areas
Date: July 8, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Last week, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT), and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-ME) led a bipartisan letter to Secretary Vilsack urging the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to update broadband speed definitions for the broadband deployment programs it oversees.

The Broadband Loan Program and Community Connect Program, within USDA, are both critical to providing much needed support for improving broadband networks in rural America. USDA recently increased the definition of broadband for the Broadband Loan Program to 10mbps download and 1mbps upload (10/1) capability, which is consistent with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Connect America Fund broadband requirement.

However, this increased speed requirement is in contrast to the recently updated 4/1 – from 3/1- broadband definition within the Community Connect Program at USDA. This inconsistency is unnecessary and problematic to ensuring the full potential of the Internet is realized in all urban and rural communities alike.

The letter has 28 bipartisan signers and has been signed by all 6 co-chairs of the Rural Broadband Caucus. It is also supported by the Rural Broadband Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

The text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be foundhere.

Dear Secretary Vilsack:

We write to you today regarding the Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program (Broadband Loan Program) and the Community Connect Grant Program (Community Connect Program). Both of these important programs are a part of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). These initiatives provide much-needed support for enhancing broadband infrastructure in rural America, and we believe USDA can further enhance the impact of these programs by making eligibility adjustments that are within the authority delegated to you by Congress. In order to maintain the programs’ relevance in an age of rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth, we strongly urge you to consider updating their broadband speed definitions, particularly the Community Connect Program’s Minimum Broadband Service benchmark.

Broadband access is a vital link to a range of necessary services and resources for America’s rural residents. Not only is it an economic development tool for businesses that may be isolated from potential customers and employees, but it broadens educational horizons for students and offers healthcare providers flexible and cost-effective care-delivery approaches. Businesses, students, and patients are taking advantage of these connectivity-enabled opportunities, which have been facilitated by innovative tools in videoconferencing, distance learning, in-home health monitoring, and telemedicine, among other areas. As use of these services increases and drives growth in IP traffic—Cisco projects a 20 percent compound annual growth rate in the volume of IP traffic in the US through 2019 —federal policymakers must ensure that taxpayer-supported infrastructure is sufficiently robust to handle demand. It is not only a matter of fairness that rural Americans can fully utilize broadband-enabled resources, but also a matter of ensuring that taxpayers are receiving the full economic development return on their investments.

In order to keep USDA’s broadband infrastructure programs in step with current needs, Congress has delegated to USDA the ability to update speed definitions within both the Broadband Loan Program and the Community Connect Program. We therefore respectfully request that for future funding years you increase the Community Connect Program’s Minimum Broadband Service definition.Such a change will enable communities that are currently ineligible, but which nonetheless lack adequate service, to engage with RUS and providers to improve their connectivity. We also strongly encourage you to coordinate such changes with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) because that agency’s universal service programs are an important partner and complement to the work of USDA – it is essential that as USDA updates it speed definition, the FCC must ensure that its universal service programs keep pace.

Thank you for your attention to this request. We look forward to working with you as USDA continues the very important management of the Community Connect Grant Program and Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program.# # #==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bill to Invest in Apprenticeships and Rebuild Workforce Skills
Date: July 6, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act. The LEARNS Act would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and ensures the registered apprenticeship program is an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers.

“A highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in today’s global economy,”Rep. Pocan said.“The LEARNS Act strengthens apprenticeship programs and helps prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. I am proud to introduce this legislation so we can continue building on the successes of the apprenticeship model and help workers secure good-paying jobs.”

“I’m proud to include legislation introduced by Rep. Pocan in the new Make It in America plan,”stated Whip Hoyer.“Last year, I was pleased he joined me during our ‘Make It In America: What’s Next’ hearing series to discuss how expanding apprenticeships can help workers obtain the necessary skills training to fill good-paying jobs. His bill – the LEARNS Act – would do just that, increasing the number of skilled workers in the U.S. and helping to close the skills gap. I look forward to working with him to advance this bill and other ideas included in the new Make It In America plan, and I thank him for his commitment to ensuring more of our workers can make it in America.”

“The Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act will help ensure that young people and families all across the United States have access to the skills, job stability, and income that registered apprenticeship programs can provide,”said Congressman Bobby Scott, Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. “The legislation would also make more resources available to companies that want to start and continue registered apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeships are one of the most direct pathways to good jobs and the LEARNS Act will extend the benefits of these programs to more Americans.”

Over the next decade, approximately 45 percent of all jobs will be in “middle-skill” occupations, which require more than a high school diploma but less than a bachelor’s degree. The registered apprenticeship program is a vital element of training for these “middle skill” occupations and helps individuals contribute to their personal economic stability and an effective workforce.

The LEARNS Act will:

• Support a closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, employers and other program sponsors offering good jobs,
• Increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by program participants,
• Create national standards for registered apprenticeship programs, and
• Establish a permanent advisory council at the Department of Labor to oversee the actions and implementation of registered apprenticeship programs.

The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-VA), John Conyers (D-MI), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jared Polis (D-CO), Mike Honda (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Gwen S. Moore (D-WI), James Langevin (D-RI), Earl Blumenauer, (D-OR), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Patrick Murphy (D-FL), Ron Kind (D-WI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Gene Green (D-TX), and Pete Visclosky (D-IN).

The legislation is also supported by a variety of business, labor, education, and advocacy groups, including: North America’s Building Trades (NABTU), Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA), the Alliance for American Manufacturing, AFL-CIO, SEIU International, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), SEIU Healthcare Northwest Training Partnership, American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT), United Auto Workers (UAW), Rebuilding America’s Middle Class (RAMC), Jobs for the Future (JFF), Siemens, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the Association for Career and Technical Education, the Aspen Institute, and Young Invincibles.# # #==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Nolan, Wilson Introduce Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act
Date: July 1, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Rep. Rick Nolan (D-MN), and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) introduced the Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act. The bill would allow student loan borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt an exemption from being taxed on the amount forgiven.

“With college debt skyrocketing, Congress should be doing everything it can to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt,”Rep. Pocan said.“Currently, when a student loan borrower has their debt forgiven, the waived loan amount is still subject to individual income taxes. This leaves borrowers on the hook for potentially massive tax bills. The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act would prevent student loan borrowers from being hit with that additional tax burden and gives them the opportunity to get out from under those loans.”

“The heart of our economic success as a nation is education and preparation of our youth,”Rep. Nolan said.“And as a former teacher, I know there is no better investment than in the education of our next generation. Students shouldn’t have to drown in debt just to go to school and get an education. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation to relieve some of this burden.”

“The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act is a common-sense solution to an all too common problem: paying off the high cost of higher education. The average college student today graduates owing more than $30,000 in student loan debt and many leave school owing a great deal more. That is an enormous burden for a young person struggling to build a future in an uncertain economy that can take more than 20 years to repay,”said Rep. Wilson, Ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.“This legislation would give borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent loan repayment a tax exemption on the amount forgiven. It would be wrong to forgive a debt that was already a struggle to repay only to replace it with a new financial encumbrance. I urge all members of Congress to support this bill.”

Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by at least 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. Students graduating from public universities leave with an average of $28,950 of debt.

Under current law, the balance forgiven under Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay as You Earn (PAYE) is treated as taxable income to the borrower, creating a tax liability that most qualifying borrowers would be unable to finance.

President Obama formally widened the pool of eligible participants in the Pay As You Earn Program (PAYE), which will help an estimated additional 5 million people manage their debt. Individuals who participate in this program as well as other loan forgiveness programs are taxed on the balance of their forgiven loan, often leaving borrowers even further in debt. While most of these individuals will pay off their loans long before the 20 year mark, those individuals still struggling to pay their loans by the 20th year should be able to discharge their loan debt without incurring an onerous tax liability.

This legislation has been endorsed by: The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), Young Invincibles, the Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Council for Opportunity in Education, U.S. PIRG, Equal Justice Works and the American Council for Education.# # #==

Madison – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement after Secretary Ash Carter officially announced the Department of Defense’s decision to lift its ban on transgender people from serving in the armed forces.

“Following in the footsteps of repealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, this is another significant step toward equality for our LGBT armed service members,”said Rep. Pocan. “No longer will transgender service members have to hide who they are to protect and defend our country. As we welcome a new era of inclusion in our armed forces, we must put a process in place to correct the injustices of systematic discrimination many LGBT individuals faced while serving their country. Too many service members still bear the scars of the discriminatory policies of the past and now we must ensure their honorable service is respected.”

Rep. Pocan and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) along with U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) previously introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in July 2015 to the House and Senate. This bipartisan legislation would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned.

Madison – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02),along with community leaders and local activists, held a National Day of Action rally on gun violence prevention in downtown Madison. Last week, the Democratic#NoBillNoBreak Sit-Inon the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives showed that Republican Leadership can no longer ignore the epidemic of gun violence. Today marks a National Day of Action on gun violence prevention, as Democratic Members of Congress from across the county will take the fight for commonsense gun safety to the streets. You can find a fact sheet on gun violence in Americahere.

“Since Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans will not stand up to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the gun manufacturers, my Democratic colleagues and I held events across the country today to ensure the voices of the people are being heard,”said Rep. Pocan.“The gun violence epidemic affects our communities every day and it is long overdue for Congress to address this issue. I want to thank everyone who showed up to the rally on this National Day of Action to say enough is enough. Together, we can demand Congress take action to help make our communities safer.”

The National Day of Action for Commonsense Gun Violence Prevention comes after House Democrats sat-in for 26 hours on the House Floor last week to demand that Speaker Ryan and House Republicans allow an immediate vote on bipartisan, commonsense gun violence prevention, including universal background checks. Republican Leaders adjourned the House early for the Fourth of July congressional recess, leaving Washington D.C. without bringing these bipartisan gun violence prevention bills to the floor for an up or down vote.

“Just one week after the historic sit-in on the House floor, leaders in Congress held yet another historic event to urge our elected officials in the U.S. House of Representatives to hold a vote on bipartisan legislation that protects the rights of law-abiding Americans, keeps guns out of the wrong hands, and saves lives,”said former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Co-Founder of the gun violence prevention organization Americans for Responsible Solutions.“I want to thank Congressman Pocan for helping lead the fight against our nation’s gun violence crisis. Speaking is difficult for me. But I haven't been silenced. And neither should the American people. Their Representatives must vote to make our communities safer.”

“Gun violence is at a high, and it’s got to be stopped. I am a victim of gun violence. I think I am a good person to speak on behalf of it,”said Jackie Miller, a gun violence survivor from Madison, WI.“I talk to thousands of youth and they are guilty of gun violence. After I am done talking they are either crying or looking straight down. They are ashamed that they got caught up in gun violence.”

"We can't continue to give prayers and thoughts to families after someone loses a loved without providing reasonable solutions to gun violence,”said Michael Johnson, President & CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County.“The prayers and thoughts are good but they need to followed by reasonable legislation that support the men and women that patrol our streets with sensible gun laws that protect children and families in every neighborhood across our nation."

“Enough is enough. Congress must act in concert with Representative Pocan to keep us safe,”said Mayor Paul Soglin.

Speakers in attendance includedJackie Millar, gun violence survivor and leader in the restorative justice movement,Everett Mitchell, Dane County Circuit Court Judge and Pastor of Christ the Solid Rock Baptist Church,Veronica Lazo, Executive Director of UNIDOS Against Domestic Violence,Patrick Farabaugh, Publisher, Our Lives Magazine,Michael Johnson, President & CEO for the Boys & Girls Club of Dane County,Terese Berceau, State Representative (D-Madison), andPaul Soglin, Mayor, City of Madison.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement as Democrats continue their sit-in demanding a vote on bills to help prevent gun violence. For 24 hours, Democrats have held the Floor to force a vote on common sense gun violence prevention measures, including universal background checks, which Americans overwhelmingly support.

“Democrats are united in the steadfast belief that we must pass common sense measures to prevent further gun violence in this country. Since Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans will not stand up to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the gun manufacturers, my Democratic colleagues and I have held the House Floor to demand action. Speaker Ryan may have turned off the Floor cameras in an attempt to silence us, but we will continue to stand up and give a voice to the majority of Americans who demand commonsense gun safety reforms.

“The mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando took the lives of 49 innocent individuals. The gun violence epidemic affects our communities every day and it is past time for Congress to address this issue. Enough is enough.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, released the following statement on the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. The shooting claimed the lives of 49 people as they celebrated Pride Month, making it the largest mass shooting in our nation’s history.

“As we grapple with the horrific events that took place yesterday morning in Orlando, my thoughts are with the families of the victims and everyone affected during Pride Month. The targeting of the LGBT individuals in this heinous act of violence has reignited many fears and uncertainty in our community. As a country, we must stand together to denounce bigotry and hatred and embrace love and acceptance.

“President Barack Obama declared this ‘an act of terror and an act of hate,’ an action perpetrated with a military-style assault weapon. Across the country people are asking themselves what they can do to help and what can be done to prevent such a devastating event from happening again.

“As a Member of Congress I contemplated these thoughts as well, ultimately coming to the conclusion that Congress won't do a thing about any of these issues again this week. In fact, all too often actions and language here in Congress and on the campaign trail actually exacerbate would-be terrorists. And actions even on the Floor of the House of Representatives all too often reinforce the hate of some people. Unfortunately, this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of military-style assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and special interests.

“In the end all we will do is have yet another moment of silence, rather than a moment of action. That disrespects the lives of the people who were killed not just yesterday, but every day by gun violence. There may be blood in the streets, but if Congress continues to fail to act, we will have blood on our hands.”

Title: Pocan, House Democrats Call on President Obama to Expand LGBT Protections in the Trans-Pacific Partnership

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), along with 26 House Democrats, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to consider renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to include explicit protections for the LGBT community.

While negotiators attempted to make progress on various human rights issues through the TPP, the agreement does not include protections for LGBT individuals. A number of participating countries have detailed histories of oppressing their citizens on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Specifically, Malaysia and Brunei have penal codes criminalizing LGBT individuals and authorities continue to persecute members ofthis community.

The letter was also signed by Reps. David Cicilline (D-RI), John Conyers (D-MI), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Donna Edwards (D-MD), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Mike Honda (D-CA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), William Keating (D-MA), Dan Kildee (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Brad Sherman (D-CA), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), and Paul Tonko (D-NY).

The text of the letter is below and signed version can be foundhere.

Dear Mr. President:

We write today to expand on concerns previously expressed by Members of Congress pertaining to the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals living in countries included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Specifically, we are concerned about recent actions taken by the Malaysian government against the transgender community and the missed opportunity presented by the TPP to combat the anti-LGBT actions of multiple countries in the agreement.

As we have expressed in the past, we deeply appreciate that your Administration has been a champion for LGBT individuals in the United States and across the globe. By speaking out in favor of equality for all individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, you have made the United States an example for the world. However, we believe more can and must be done to protect LGBT people abroad, and the TPP offers a clear opportunity to leverage changes in countries persecuting these individuals.

We are particularly concerned with the continued persecution of the transgender community in Malaysia. Last year, Malaysian officials entered a private event and arrested the nine attendees under a law that criminalizes transgender individuals wearing clothing matching the gender with which they identify. The court subsequently sentenced the nine women to fines and two of the women to jail.

In April, Malaysian religious authorities raided an event benefitting the transgender community, resulting in the arrest and potential imprisonment of the event organizer and the threat of imprisonment against a lawyer who defended the transgender attendees. These are just two examples in a long history of abuses by Malaysian authorities, incidents which underscore the concerns previously raised about severe human rights abuses and penal codes permitting violence against LGBT people in Malaysia and Brunei.

For these reasons, we urge you to use the opportunity presented by the United States’ inclusion in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to explicitly protect LGBT individuals in the agreement’s participating countries. This agreement encompasses nearly forty percent of the global economy and the United States has the largest economy of the twelve participating countries. The United States should use this position of strength to advocate for the fair treatment of the LGBT community in Malaysia and Brunei. Unfortunately, while the Administration attempted to address other human rights issues in our partner countries, the agreement and side letters as negotiated do not include protections for LGBT individuals.

Given the continued prevalence of attacks on the LGBT community in Malaysia and Brunei, we urge you to consider renegotiating the agreement to include protections for gender and sexual minorities and further demand that these countries treat all of their citizens as equal under the law regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.# # #==

Title: Pocan Statement on Wisconsin AG Brad Schimel’s Decision to Join Challenge to President’s Transgender Student Guidance
Date: May 25, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, released the following statement after Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimeljoined10 other states in challenging President Obama’s federal guidance for schools on how to protect the rights of all students regardless of gender identity:

“Schimel’s decision should come as no surprise to those familiar with Scott Walker’s backwards approach to governing the state. While Governor Walker and Schimel may couch this decision in protecting Wisconsin’s interests, nothing could be farther from the truth. It’s a poor and pitiful attempt to catch a dying wave of shameful political attacks on transgender youth, in an effort to advance an antiquated ideology.

“Instead, we should be looking to support policies in our schools that make students safer, not eliminate protections for some of our most vulnerable students. Many of our country’s leading education groups including the National PTA and the National Education Association have embraced these federal guidelines, signaling they would provide students with safe and welcoming schools. I couldn’t agree more. We cannot lose sight of the fact that these are students who want nothing more than to live authentic lives free of discrimination.”

Title: Paul Ryan and the GOP Majority’s Terribly Homophobic Week in Congress
Date: May 19, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the GOP majority executed two anti-equality measures in major legislation this week, with the complicity of Speaker Paul Ryan.

The first action was in direct violation of the promise Ryan made when he became speaker – Congress would have regular order, which allows for full consideration of amendments in floor debate. This week, the GOP Majority prevented a bipartisan amendment from coming before the full House for a vote, to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which would have stripped the bill language allowing some federal contractors to discriminate in their hiring practices against LGBT individuals and other groups. This bipartisan amendment would have restored President Obama’s executive order banning anti-LGBT discrimination by federal contractors.

The second action occurred on the floor Thursday, when an amendment to prohibit federal contractors from getting government work if they discriminate against the LGBT community failed. After initially securing enough votes for passage, GOP leadership cajoled several of their members to switch their votes to defeat the amendment. In an unprecedented move, House Republican Leadership refused to release the names of the individuals who switched their vote.

“Paul Ryan had a terrible week this week. His image of inclusion was shattered as he, not once but twice, led his majority to deliver bigoted votes against the LGBT community in America. Apparently, Ryan thinks it’s OK to fire someone simply for who they are or who they love. The actions this week show why the GOP majority under the leadership of Ryan and Donald Trump are clearly out of touch with the majority of American people.

“I personally was sad to see Ryan’s leadership show its true face. I’ve always had a cordial relationship with the Speaker, but when he so easily is willing to see people be discriminated against and fired simply because of who they are shows what Paul really thinks of me and so many of his own constituents. If he thought differently, he could have stopped the actions that occurred.

“The GOP majority’s willingness to so openly discriminate against the LGBT community underscores why the fight for equality in America is not over. We must continue to fight to ensure everyone can go through their daily lives without facing the threat of discrimination, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.”

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Republican majority rejected his amendment with Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which would have restored benefits to gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexual orientation.

“Veterans who have risked their lives for our country should not be discriminated against based solely on sexual orientation,”said. Rep. Pocan.“We must do everything possible to rectify the effects of past policies to ensure that our veterans’ service is respected and valued in the eyes of our country. I am deeply disappointed that House Republicans continue to deny our veterans the recognition and benefits they deserve.”

Reps. Pocan and Rangel previously introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in July 2015, which would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has113 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and38 cosponsorsin the Senate.# # #==
Title: Members of Congress Stand with Colombia Trade Unions and Call on Administration to Fully Enforce Colombia Free Trade Agreement
Date: May 17, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC— Members of Congress today stood with Colombia’s trade unions and called on the Administration to fully enforce the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and protect unionists abroad. During the press conference, Members of Congress and the unionists highlighted how the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has proved to be both inadequate and unenforceable.

Tuesday’s press conference comes just a day after the AFL-CIO filed an official complaint under the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Since the FTA went into force, the complaint reports that 1,466 workers have suffered threats or acts of violence, including 99 assassinations, 6 kidnappings, and 955 death threats. The complaint asserts that impunity for these acts is 87 percent and that the cases have not resulted in a single conviction.

“The Colombian Free Trade Agreement and Labor Action Plan were supposed to bring the most modern labor standards into place, but four years later we are still seeing murders, disappearances, and threats,” saidCongressman Mark Pocan (WI-02). “Nothing has substantively changed in the country and it’s absolutely unconscionable. This is the exact reason why we are so skeptical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If the language is nearly identical to the Colombian agreement, why should we feel that there will be any difference in labor rights in a trade deal encompassing 40 percent of the world’s economy.”

“Since the U.S. entered into the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, my colleagues and I have called upon the Administration to fully enforce the agreement’s labor provisions. However, worker abuse continues to run rampant, ongoing threats and acts of violence are not investigated or prosecuted, and workers have lost their lives,” saidCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03). “These are violations of life, liberty, and safety – they are unconscionable. Union workers, activists, and their families should not live in fear. That is why we must reject the nearly identical labor provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”

“My colleagues and I have pressed the Colombian government to close the loophole in the Labor Action Plan that allows third-party contractors to deny basic rights and dignities,” saidCongresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09). “Since the Colombia Free Trade Agreement went into force, worker and unionist violence – instead of ending as promised – has continued. This has even included assassinations and kidnapping of labor organizers. I am proud to stand with Colombian workers in their complaint under the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and against the Trans Pacific Partnership that contains the same provisions that fail to protect workers. It is time for third-party intermediation to end and to ensure that our trade agreements truly protect workers all over the world.”

“Colombia’s workers – especially Afro-Colombians and members of the indigenous communities – have long faced violence, persecution and a lack of opportunity, which in turn further perpetuates a cycle of poverty in Colombia,” saidCongressman Hank Johnson (GA-04). “As the moral and economic leader of the world, the U.S. must espouse policies that break this cycle. We must insist on protection for Colombian labor activists facing political persecution and death simply for forming a union or fighting for basic civil and human rights. We cannot turn a blind eye to these abuses.”

“Years after the Labor Action Plan went into place, Columbians are still being threatened, assaulted, and killed. Violence against trade unionists in Colombia have not been properly investigated or prosecuted, and only one person has been convicted for murdering a trade unionist. The working men and women in Colombia deserve better,” saidCongressman Keith Ellison (MN-05). “Our government said the agreement with Colombia contained strong labor protections. They were wrong. We must protect workers in Colombia, and we must make sure that any trade agreement we make in the future, ensures workers’ protections. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.”

Title: U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Representatives Ron Kind, Gwen Moore and Mark Pocan Call on Justice Department to Review Wisconsin’s Voter ID Law
Date: May 2, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and U.S. Representatives Ron Kind (D-WI 3), Gwen Moore (D-WI 4) and Mark Pocan (D-WI 2) today called on the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a review of Wisconsin’s voter identification requirements and consider bringing a legal challenge or join litigation in Wisconsin’s Eastern and Western District Courts.

“The barriers these requirements have set up and the harmful impact they have had for many Wisconsin voters demonstrate that now is the time for a full and thorough review of the constitutionality of the voter ID law,”the members of Congress wrote. “These developments raise serious questions about the impact the voter ID law has had on the ability of many Wisconsinites to exercise perhaps their most fundamental constitutional right – the right to vote and participate in our democracy. As such, we believe it is critical that the Department of Justice carefully review the effect of this law and what steps it can take to help uphold the voting rights of all Wisconsinites.”

In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Wisconsin Congressional Democrats urge the Justice Department to conduct a review of Wisconsin’s potentially discriminatory voting requirements to determine whether they are consistent with theVoting Rights Actand federal constitutional protections for the right to vote. The members of Congress also call for a review of all the options available to the Department of Justice, including bringing a legal challenge or intervening in existing litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that eligible voters facing difficulty obtaining ID have the right to challenge the law as it applies to them. This issue is now back before Wisconsin’s Eastern District court. A separate challenge brought in the state’s Western District is scheduled to go to trial in May.

While Wisconsin’s voter ID law has been under the scrutiny of federal courts for several years, the April 5th primary election was the first instance in which the law, one of the nation’s most restrictive, was implemented. This election day, there were numerous press reports of long lines and significant challenges for many voters, particularly students, to comply with the requirements of the new law. Additional press reports highlighted troubling statements by individuals closely connected to the state legislature’s consideration of the law, indicating that its passage may have been motivated, at least in part, by a desire to reduce youth and minority participation in elections.

“I am deeply disappointed by the Department of Transportation’s decision to grant Norwegian Air International a permit to fly to the United States, “said Rep.

Title: Pocan Introduces Tribal Marijuana Sovereignty Act
Date: April 20, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) introduced the Tribal Marijuana Sovereignty Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from considering a tribe’s marijuana policy when disbursing federal dollars to sovereign tribes.

“I strongly believe states should be allowed to enact their own marijuana laws, and have consistently supported attempts to ensure federal laws do not interfere with them,”said Rep. Mark Pocan.“I’m also an ardent supporter of tribal sovereignty, which is why I introduced this bill forbidding the federal government from considering marijuana production, possession, or sale as an adverse factor when disbursing federal funds."

Despite Congressional efforts to prevent federal interference in state marijuana programs, federal agencies have enacted policies that do not reflect this directive. As an example, after Congress passed the 2014 Farm Bill, the United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) issued a directive that prohibits any USDA-NRCS funding to agriculture producers who cultivate marijuana on any land, even if legal under state law. Many tribes are dependent upon federal assistance and this heavy-handed approach could severely impact tribes that need federal assistance the most.

Due to federal guidelines, doctors and nurses in federally-funded health centers are prohibited from discussing marijuana with their patients. They are prohibited from advising patients against self-medicating with marijuana, in addition to prescribing it for medical purposes. The bill reforms these guidelines and allows Indian Health Service doctors to discuss marijuana with their patients. Additionally, the bill also ensures that individual members utilizing Indian Housing won’t be evicted for minor possession of marijuana.###==
Title: Pocan, Renacci Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Eliminate Budget Gimmick
Date: April 15, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Jim Renacci (OH-16) and Mark Pocan (WI-02) were joined by Reps. Daniel Webster (FL-10), John Carney (DE at-large), Derek Kilmer (WA-06), and Richard Hanna (NY-22) to introduce bipartisan legislation to eliminate a Washington-created budget gimmick and protect employees and their employers.

Under current law, pension insurance premiums that are paid by employers to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) are included in the federal budget and are considered “on-budget.” This provides the illusion this revenue can be used for general government spending, even though these premiums cannot be allocated to other government programs besides the PBGC benefit pension plans. In recent years, Congress has increased the PBGC premiums several times in order to off-set increased spending; most recently increasing premiums through 2025 by $7.65 billion in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

The Pension and Budget Integrity Act simply moves these premiums “off-budget”, and ensures that Congress is raising premiums only if and when it is appropriate.

“For too long Congress has raised pension premiums as a gimmick to balance the budget on the backs of working class Americans,”said Rep. Mark Pocan. “This legislation will ensure that when Congress chooses to increase these premiums, it does so for the benefit of the PBGC and pension beneficiaries.”

“We need to improve our country’s fiscal health by balancing the federal budget, and it cannot be done with accounting gimmicks. In this case, the pension premiums are being raised in order to pay for our federal programs, but in reality that revenue will only be allotted to PBGC plans. Budget gimmicks only result in contributing to our nation’s growing debt. Our commonsense, bipartisan bill promotes sound budgetary policy and helps protect the PBGC from losing vital premium contributors,”Rep. Jim Renacci said.

“Far too often, the federal budgeting process includes technical maneuvering for the purpose of swaying perception or public opinion. Over the past few years, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) has fallen victim to this distorted practice. I applaud Rep. Renacci for his bipartisan legislation to eliminate this budget gimmick and join his efforts to make the federal government more transparent and accountable in their spending,”Rep. Daniel Webster said.

“The Pension and Budget Integrity Act protects the retirement income of hard-working Americans from congressional budgeting tricks. Over the years, Congress has used this stunt instead of working on bipartisan solutions that would honestly deal with our spending. This bill is a step in the right direction towards a more responsible way of spending,”Rep. John Carney said.

“American workers deserve to know that their retirement earnings will continue to be safe,” saidRep. Derek Kilmer. “For too long pension premiums paid by employers have been at risk from Congressional budget stunts. Our bipartisan bill ensures that Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation funds are not subjected to the Congressional budget making process so workers can have peace of mind and we can focus on actually balancing our budget.”

Title: Pocan Supports Verizon Workers Poised to Strike for a Fair Contract
Date: April 12, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in support of the nearly 40,000 Verizon workers from Massachusetts to Virginia poised to strike tomorrow for a fair contract.

“Companies should pay their workers fair wages and guarantee workplace protections. As a small business owner, I know the value of loyal, well-trained, and hard-working employees. I also know how important it is that all parties share in a company’s success. It is unacceptable for Verizon to continue amassing massive profits, while their workers lack job security and struggle to make ends meet. I support the workers striking tomorrow in their demand for a fair contract.”

The Communications Workers of American (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), who represent the workers, have already agreed to health care cost reductions. However, negotiations have stalled over a lack of layoff protections for newer workers, offshore call centers, pension freezes, and a new policy that could require employees to work away far from home for as long as two months without seeing their families. Verizon’s last agreement with its workers expired in August 2015.###==
Title: Pocan Applauds Treasury Department’s Anti-Inversion Regulations
Date: April 5, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the U.S. Department of the Treasury announcednew regulationsto limit corporate tax inversions:

“The regulations released by the Department of the Treasury makes it much harder for wealthy corporations to move overseas and reduces incentives to use tax loopholes to skirt their responsibilities. I applaud the Administration’s strong actions and deep commitment to stopping corporate tax inversions. Now it is up to Congress to take the next step to stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system and force these companies to contribute their fair share.”

Pfizer recently merged with Allergan, a drug firm based in Ireland, in order to dodge an estimated $35 billion of U.S. taxes, according to a new Americans for Tax Fairnessreportreleased in February. The Department of the Treasury’s new regulations would apply to foreign companies that are serial inverters, such as Allergan, and takes account of their prior acquisitions of U.S. companies. The new rules also limit earnings stripping, a method of corporate tax avoidance in which U.S. firms reduce their taxable income by making large interest payments to related entities.

In November 2015, Rep. Pocan introduced theCorporate Fair Share Tax Actand thePutting America First Corporate Actto prevent corporations from using “tax inversions” to reduce a company’s U.S. tax burden and ensure they cannot avoid taxes by hiding profits overseas.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the United States Supreme Court delivered its decision inFriedrichs v. California Teachers Association, affirming the rights of teachers and other public sector employees to have a seat at the table and the ability to strengthen their profession through union representation. The 4-4 ruling upholds the lower court’s decision and allows the 1976Abood v. Detroit Board of Educationdecision to remain precedent.

“Today’s decision by the Supreme Court is a huge victory for fair access to union representation and collective bargaining rights. Unions strengthen the middle class by allowing hardworking Americans to come together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. As we celebrate this victory, we must continue to fight against attacks to weaken workers’ voices in the workplace.”

Title: Pocan, Rangel Request Armed Services Committee Hold Hearing on Discharged Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Service Members

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charles Rangel (D-NY) today sent aletterto Chairman Mac Thornberry requesting the House Committee on Armed Services hold a hearing on the challenges faced by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexual orientation.

The letter states:“Since World War II, more than 100,000 individuals are estimated to have been discharged from the military due to their sexual orientation. Today, thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans are tarnished with discharge statuses other than honorable. This status affects both their access to benefits they have earned from their service and their opportunities in civilian life, potentially hindering employment opportunities and the right to vote.”

Reps. Pocan and Rangel previously introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in July 2015, which would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has113 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and38 cosponsorsin the Senate.

A signed copy of the letter can be foundhereand the full text is below.

Dear Chairman Thornberry:

We write today to request the House Committee on Armed Services hold a hearing on the challenges faced by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexual orientation and who seek to have their discharge characterization upgraded to “honorable.” Specifically, we request the Committee examine undue difficulties in the current review process and evaluate bipartisan solutions to address these problems.

The repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2011 represented a significant step forward for our military and brought justice to thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. This change allowed all individuals wishing to serve our country the opportunity to do so without being forced to hide who they are, and signaled to those discharged due to their sexual orientation that their service is deeply valued. Our military readiness and national security are stronger and we are closer to the American ideals of fairness and equality due to the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”

Unfortunately, too many service members still bear the scars of this discriminatory policy. Since World War II, more than 100,000 individuals are estimated to have been discharged from the military due to their sexual orientation. Today, the records of thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans are tarnished with discharge statuses other than honorable. This status affects both their access to benefits they have earned from their service and their opportunities in civilian life, potentially hindering employment opportunities and the right to vote. Even those discharged under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” who received an honorable discharge status risk facing discrimination and a violation of privacy because the Narrative Reason for their discharge may include “Homosexual Conduct,” “Homosexual Act,” or “Homosexual Marriage.”

In response to the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the Department of Defense (DoD) took an important step by implementing a process for service members to appeal their discharge status and change their discharge narrative. However, this can be a burdensome course of action for service members, who often need to obtain legal counsel to navigate the process and provide paperwork they may no longer have.

We have introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in order to streamline and codify the current DoD policy, ensuring all gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members have the opportunity to correct their record and affirm their honorable service. This legislation simplifies the paperwork requirement for a service member to initiate a review and clarifies that a review cannot be denied solely based on a lack of documentation. Further, the bill moves the burden to produce relevant documentation from the service member to the DoD. Lastly, the legislation requires military service historians to review the circumstances of these discharges, helping service members prove they were discharged solely due to their sexual orientation. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has gained broad, bipartisan support in the United States Congress – 113 cosponsors in the 114th Congress – and offers a strong path forward to address current difficulties.

Our service members deserve a straightforward and accessible process to ensure their honorable service is reflected in their records. For these reasons, we urge the House Committee on Armed Services to schedule a hearing on this issue in the near future. We look forward to your response.==
Title: U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan, Ron Kind, and Gwen Moore Call on Governor Walker to Immediately Restore Food Assistance to Thousands of Wisconsinites
Date: March 22, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and U.S. Representatives Ron Kind (D-WI 3), Gwen Moore (D-WI 4) and Mark Pocan (D-WI 2) sent a letter to Governor Scott Walker calling on him to immediately restore food assistance to thousands of Wisconsinites by requesting and reinstating the federal waiver for 20 counties and 10 cities with high unemployment rates.

Recent reports have concluded thatpoverty in Wisconsin has reached alarming levelsand the highest rates in years in many parts of the state. Currently, 20 counties and 10 cities in Wisconsin have unemployment levels that would allow them to qualify for an exemption waiver to the food assistance restrictions for certain low-income Wisconsinites. For over a decade, Wisconsin—along with many other states—has instituted a federal waiver to exempt vulnerable individuals in areas of high unemployment from these time limits on food assistance eligibility. But, Governor Walker has now decided to remove this exemption and force many vulnerable Wisconsinites to lose access to the food they need.

“In the face of economic insecurity across Wisconsin, you have chosen to reject this exemption waiver option, putting thousands of vulnerable Wisconsinites at risk of losing access to critical food assistance. Instead of denying access to food, we urge you to reconsider your decision and reinstate Wisconsin’s long-held federal waiver to ensure continued food security for Wisconsinites struggling to get ahead in a struggling economy. The impact of your decision is being felt in very real ways by low-income individuals who are struggling to find employment,”the members of Congress wrote.“The economy is suffering and state job training programs are failing to keep their promise of moving people from dependence to independence.”

The Wisconsin members of Congress also questioned the effectiveness of the Walker Administration’s employment and training programs and asked the Governor to continue working to fully implement all federal recommendations and corrective actions for the FoodShare Employment and Training (FSET) program.

“Our goal is helping people achieve economic security and independence, but the state’s employment and training programs are not working as promised to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, your Administration is failing to ensure people are fully aware of and participating in the FSET program, and recent reports show that only 10 percent of recipients who were referred to FSET have been successfully placed in jobs. In addition, federal corrective actions have been placed on ResCare, a private vendor that is supported by taxpayer funding. ResCare operates FSET in Milwaukee County and six other counties and is the subject of civil rights violations and non-compliance with Wisconsin’s approved FSET plan. We are deeply troubled by these reports and the fact that your plan relies on a state program that is not functioning as promised to Wisconsin taxpayers,”the members of Congress wrote to Governor Walker.

Already, reports indicate that over 30,000 Wisconsinites have been kicked off of the FoodShare program, including 16,560 in Milwaukee County, due to the decision to remove the waiver. This has put a strain on Wisconsin food banks, which help those most in need avoid hunger and now face an increased demand that may jeopardize their food supply. Hunger Task Force, for example, already serves over 34,000 individuals each month in Milwaukee County. If these trends in FoodShare disenrollment continue, there could be a dramatic increase in the number people turning to Hunger Task Force for assistance.

In the letter to Governor Walkerfrom Baldwin, Kind, Moore and Pocan, they said,“The solution to these problems should not be to build barriers and make it harder for people to achieve economic independence. Rather, we must continue to support opportunities to lift people up and out of poverty and ensure that our jobs training programs are truly working.”

Title: Pocan Introduces CPC Debt-Free College Amendment to House Republican Budget
Date: March 17, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC – Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Co-Chairs Reps. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), along with CPC First-Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released statements today after Rep. Pocanofferedthe CPC’s debt-free college resolution as an amendment to the House Republican budget. First introduced in April 2015 by the CPC co-chairs along with Senators Schatz, Schumer and Warren, the resolution prioritizes making debt free college a reality.

Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. Students graduating from public universities leave with an average of $28,950 of debt.

“A college education is an essential tool for getting into the middle class. Yet it’s become all too common to accept the fact that students must graduate with crushing levels of debt,”Rep. Pocan said.“It’s time to end the reliance on debt as a way to finance a college education. We need to work with students, universities, states, and the federal government to ensure college is affordable and accessible for everyone.”

“Education remains the single greatest avenue of upward mobility our society has ever known,”Rep. Grijalva said.“If Republicans truly want their budget to create an economy and a society that works for every American, then they should ensure a college degree is within reach for anyone committed to earning it. I commend Rep. Pocan for fighting for students today. The fact that the GOP failed to accept his amendment speaks volumes about the vision they want their budget to be.”

“Too many students are forced to choose between continuing their education or a lifetime of debt,”Rep. Ellison said.“The financial burden of student loans limits the career choices of students and their ability to buy homes, save, or start a family. If we want to make sure that going to college doesn't mean giving up a secure future, we must make college affordable. Debt free college is a way to ensure that anyone who wants a brighter future is able to seek one without crushing debt.”

In April 2015, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Senators Schatz, Schumer, and Warren introducedresolutionsin the House and Senate supporting efforts to ensure that students have access to debt-free higher education. The House Resolution, H. Res. 214, currently has 78 Democratic cosponsors and the Senate Resolution has 23 cosponsors.# # #==
Title: Rebecca Bradley’s Last 48 Hours Have Been Spin Not Substance
Date: March 10, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

MADISON – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) has yet to receive a response from Justice Rebecca Bradley afterhe extended an invitationto her to come and meet with the LGBT community and those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as others she targeted in a series of public writings. Inan interviewwith The Capital Times earlier this week, Bradley indicated that she would be willing to do this meeting.

“Bradley’s comments over the last 48 hours have been purely spin, not substance,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “She seems to be throwing darts at a dart board trying to see what sticks. For example,it’s been more than 500 days since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed same-sex marriages to proceed, yet Bradley has not performed a single same-sex marriage, even though her campaign insists she is open to it. Many Judges in Milwaukee were rushing to volunteer to perform them.If she really has had a mosaic of experiences that changed her worldview why hasn’t one of those been performing a same-sex marriage ceremony? The problem for Bradley is that she can’t point to anything she has written or made public in the last two decades that show a change of heart and the people of Wisconsin deserve the truth. That is why I am baffled she will not directly respond to our invitation.”

Bradley alsomentioned on Mondaythather public writings were a result of her being upset about the outcome of the 1992 presidential election, but two of the pieces were published in February of 1992, almost 10 months earlier, indicating a consistent worldview, rather than something written in the heat of the moment.In the last several days, she has insinuated thatattendingan event by the LGBT rights group Fair Wisconsin, as a candidate attempting to get votes for Milwaukee Circuit Court, is an example of her change of heart.

That only begs another question Bradley should answer for the public:Is she more concerned about alienating constituents and groups that are extremely active spending large sums of dark money to support her and have proven ties with an anti-equality agenda, such as the shadowy Wisconsin Alliance for Reform? Itswebsite was registered by Lorri Pickens, the 2006 campaign manager for the anti-marriage equality group Vote Yes for Marriage in Wisconsin.

“These are exactly the type of misleading comments and unanswered questions that have so many people in Wisconsin worried about her temperament serving on our state’s highest court,” continued Rep. Mark Pocan. “Attending events to stump for votes does not demonstrate remorse nor absolve appointed Justice Bradley from her vitriolic statements of hatred. While I understand she is embarrassed that these public writings have surfaced, her comments to the press since Monday have been emblematic of a calculated politician doing damage control, not someone who has had a true change of heart.”

MADISON – After Justice Rebecca Bradley’s hate-filled attackscame to light yesterday, she put out a statement that did not apologize for her past hate speech and offered no explanation for her supposed change of heart. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) responded with this statement and offer:

“Justice Rebecca Bradley’s extremely vitriolic statements about the LGBT community and individuals living with HIV/AIDS were not renounced in her ambiguous statement that appeared to be offered to dodge responsibility for an extremist, hateful worldview expressed multiple times in past public diatribes.

“Her statement yesterday was directed toward people she offended rather than renouncing her own hateful past worldview. Bradley concluded it claiming her crude, bigoted ideas should have no impact on current Wisconsin voters while giving no explanation of her claimed change of heart. To even insinuate that these hateful sentiments were acceptable in 1992 throws into question what Rebecca Bradley really believes and if she is truly fair and impartial enough to serve on our state’s highest court.

“I would like to extend an offer to Justice Bradley to come and meet with the LBGT community and those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as others she targeted in her public writings such as their supportive family members, environmentalists, people struggling with substance abuse, and women making private health decisions. The only way to discover if her worldview has truly changed is to have an open dialogue with the thousands of people she targeted in her past about where her heart really is at today.”

Title: Progressive Caucus Releases The People’s Budget for FY 2017

Content:
Washington, DC – Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Co-Chairs Reps. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), and CPC First-Vice Chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today released the Progressive Caucus’ budget for fiscal year 2017, calledThe People’s Budget: Prosperity Not Austerity; Invest in America.

“The People’s Budgetreverses harmful austerity cuts and fixes a system that for far too long has only benefited those at the top,”Rep. Pocan said.“The Progressive Caucus Budget rebuilds our crumbling roads and bridges, creates good paying jobs, and increases educational opportunities from pre-kindergarten to college. Our budget invests in the American people and gives working families the best opportunity to get ahead.”

“The People’s Budgetis a true expression of progressive values,”Rep. Grijalva said.“More than numbers and charts, our budget is a path forward for the American people who’ve had their wages flat line and savings erode. It alleviates our overcrowded classrooms where kids struggle to learn, and makes higher education a reality for any student committed to earning a college degree. It ensures profit motives and systemic inequalities have no place in our criminal justice system or our immigration policies. The investments we detail will create jobs, protect the environment and promote growth by requiring the wealthiest among us, corporations and Wall Street to contribute their fair share to our society. While Republicans continue fighting over how much more seniors should sacrifice,The People’s Budgetshows that their harmful cuts are a false prophecy for American economic success.”

“It’s time to invest in our country and in working people who simply want to provide for their families,”Rep. Ellison said.“The People’s Budgethelps families by creating jobs, improving education, and rebuilding our roads and bridges. We’ve seen what good investments can do in the Twin Cities. After the Green Line Light Rail was completed in 2014, businesses have grown and another $2.5 billion in private investment has poured in along the route. In cities like Flint, Michigan, we see what happens when governments put cutting costs ahead of people’s health. The state government’s refusal to invest in Flint has resulted in lead exposure for thousands of residents - all because the state government wanted to cut corners. A tragedy like Flint cannot happen again. We can and should make fair investments in America, andThe People’s Budgetis the best path forward.”

The executive summary forThe People’s Budgetis below and the full budget can be foundhere.

The People’s Budget Executive Summary

While our economy is rebounding from the Great Recession, hardworking Americans are being left behind. Our economic and political system has lost sight of what matters most: We the People.The Congressional Progressive Caucus’ Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 provides major reinvestments in our country through infrastructure, education, and wage growth to increase opportunity for all. The People’s Budget is a down payment on a brighter future for all Americans, ensuring every family struggling to make ends meet has a fair shot at the American Dream.

An investment in roads, bridges, and railways is an investment in the safety and prosperity of the American people. The People’s Budget commits $1 trillion in infrastructure spending overall to transform our country’s crumbling roads, bridges, and facilities into a 21stcentury network, creating jobs and improving economic opportunities in the process. This includes billions for water lines nationwide and $765 million specifically for Flint, Michigan, to replace toxic pipelines and provide needed health, education, and other services for residents exposed to lead. Families should never have to worry about whether their water is safe to drink, or their roads are safe to drive on.

Access to equitableeducationopportunities is key to ensuring future generations are prepared for success. From pre-school through college, every student deserves the right to high-quality affordable education. The People’s Budget invests in our students by providing robust early learning opportunities, effective public schools for all students, and debt-free college.

The People’s Budget creates 3.6 million good paying jobs to push our economy back to full-employment, which will provide the necessary economic conditions to spuracross-the-board wage growth for hardworking Americans. It empowers working families, protects collective bargaining, and seeks to close the pay equity gap. It also increases funding for worker protection agencies to crack down on wage theft, combat overtime abuses, and safeguard workers’ retirement savings. Now is the time for Congress to remove the barriers that have held down wages for working Americans.

The People’s Budget makes major public investments to rebuild America by fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, improving schools, moving towards clean energy, and creating good paying jobs in the process.# # #==
Title: House Democrats Urge Administration to Take Immediate Action to Stop Corporate Inversions following Report on Extent of Pfizer Tax Dodging and Price Gouging
Date: February 25, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington— Today, several Democratic Members of Congress, along with the Executive Director of Americans for Tax Fairness, Frank Clemente, released amajor new reporton the extent of Pfizer’s tax dodging and price gouging, as well as aletterto Treasury Secretary Jack Lew urging the Administration to use its executive authority to deny the tax benefits of the proposed corporate inversion. Seven senators, led by Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin, sent a similar letter to Secretary Lew today as well.

“As a small business owner for over 29 years, I am especially concerned about big corporations that pay their accountants rather than paying their taxes,” saidRepresentative Mark Pocan (WI-02). “Main street businesses play by the rules and pay their fair share continue footing the bill for offshore tax dodging corporations. This is exactly the sort of egregious corporate activity undermines the U.S. tax base and our economy and we urge the Administration to crack down on it.”

“Pfizer is not only America’s biggest pharmaceutical company, but also one of our biggest tax dodgers and price gougers. To finagle even more tax avoidance, Pfizer now wants to renounce its American citizenship. While Pfizer wants to pay lower Irish taxes, it refuses to charge Americans lower Irish drug prices,” saidCongressman Lloyd Doggett (TX-35). “Today we are issuing a formal plea for specific Administration action, backed up with line and verse regarding how that can be accomplished. The US Treasury is suffering from a form of severe bleeding that no overpriced Pfizer medication can stop, but to the Administration, we say use existing law, ‘heal thyself.’”

“As if gouging the American people with overpriced prescription drugs wasn’t enough, Pfizer is now trying to dodge $35 billion in taxes. You can’t make this up.” saidRep. Peter Welch (VT-. “Pharmaceutical companies provide good drugs that are life-saving and pain-reliving, but their prices are killing us. And now, Pfizer wants to pay Irish taxes but they won’t give Americans Irish drug prices. The Administration should throw a monkey wrench into Pfizer’s plan, stat.”

“American taxpayers are fed up with big corporations shifting their tax obligations onto working families because Congress has failed to close the egregious inversion loophole,” saidCongressman Chris Van Hollen (MD-8). “We cannot continue to allow companies to shortchange hard working Americans simply by changing their mailing address. We must work to end this egregious loophole and the tax games inverted companies play using every means at our disposal.”

Pfizer—maker of Celebrex, Lipitor, Lyrica, and Viagra—is attempting to permanently dodge an estimated $35 billion of U.S. taxes it currently owes by merging with Allergan, a drug firm based in Ireland, according to a new Americans for Tax Fairness report that was released today. The report also documents a rapid rise in Pfizer’s prescription drug prices in recent years, and it compares the vast difference in the prices Pfizer charges for the same drugs in the U.S. and in Ireland, the country to which it is changing its corporate address.

“By dodging taxes while boosting prescription drug prices, Pfizer squeezes American families and communities from two sides at once,” saidAmericans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente. “In the company’s biggest insult to America yet, Pfizer’s merger would allow it to go on enjoying all the benefits of being based here—everything from a publicly-educated workforce, to an excellent communications infrastructure, to a reliable patent system—without adequately paying to support them.”

“We cannot continue to allow Pfizer and other corporations to pretend that they are American companies, reaping the benefits this country has to offer, all while claiming to be another nationality when the tax bill comes,” saidCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03). “Corporations are cheating the American people out of revenue that could make a real difference in the lives of children and families, so that they can dodge taxes and gouge prices. The Administration must take action, but Congress also needs to work to stop inversions. We must do better.”

The tax benefits of these corporate inversions could be denied if Treasury revises a Notice it issued in 2014 intended to remove costly tax breaks U.S. companies receive when they merge or invert with a foreign company based in a tax haven. Johnson Controls had $8.1 billion in offshore profits in 2015 on which it will likely be able to avoid paying U.S. income taxes should the proposed merger be completed.

“What Pfizer is doing to the American taxpayer is not only unfair, it’s unpatriotic. Our country invests in research and innovation,” saidCongresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-9). “We invest in education. Those public investments are major reason why companies like Pfizer find the workforce they need and develop new drugs. This new report from Americans for Tax Fairness shows how Pfizer takes advantage of all of this public investment, gouges consumers on drug prices and then seeks to move its profits overseas to avoid taxes while still reaping the rewards of public investment in the United States. This is simply unacceptable.”

Title: Pocan, Ellison Send Letter to PBS: Let's Talk About Making it Easier for Everyone to Vote in the Democratic Debate on Thursday
Date: February 9, 2016
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON — Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN) sent a letter to PBS urging the moderators of Thursday’s Democratic Debate in Milwaukee to bring up the topic of voting rights.

The text of the letter is below and available onlinehere.

Dear Public Broadcasting Service:

We have had 13 Presidential debates and heard from the candidates on a wide range of issues from White House floral arrangements to presidential eligibility, yet voting rights is glaringly absent from the conversation. In fact, Democratic candidates have only spent about three minutes on the topic over their five debates. We urge PBS to include the topic of voter participation in Thursday’s Democratic Presidential debate in Milwaukee.

By failing to have a substantive dialogue about voting rights, debate moderators and candidates are ignoring a disturbing trend. Across the nation, the democratic process is being undermined through voter suppression laws. Thursday’s democratic debate is the time to outline a plan to make it easier to vote.

Since the 2013 Supreme Court decision Shelby County v. Holder, which weakened the Voting Rights Act (VRA), laws limiting voter participation have been enacted in states across the country. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, since the beginning of the 2015 legislative session at least 113 bills have been introduced in 33 states that wouldrequire photo ID, reduce early voting, or make voter registration more difficult. For instance, 16 states—including Wisconsin—will have new voter restriction laws in place for this election, which they did not have in 2012.

In Wisconsin, the partisan voter ID law places huge burdens on voters around the state. Residents who live in rural counties where the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has limited hours, homeless veterans concentrated in cities like Milwaukee, and students with technical college IDs, who typically come from lower income households face additional hurdles to get the proper ID to vote. Inone particular case, a homeless veteran in Milwaukee spent two years making trips to the DMV and Social Security office because his government issued veterans license was not accepted at the polls.

It is no coincidence that these laws are designed to deliberately make it harder to for people of color, young people, low-income individuals, and seniors to vote.

It is also not surprising why voting rights have not come up in GOP debates. Conservatives help advance their policy agenda by suppressing the vote of folks who care about social security, student debt, universal health care and affordable housing. They look the other way while voters wait in line for hours to vote, or can’t vote because they can’t leave their job while the polls are open.

Given that the2016 election will be the first presidential contest in 50 years without the full protections of the VRA, it is more important than ever for Democratic candidates to detail their plans to ensure the American people have a voice in the electoral process.

Voter restriction laws have consequences. Arecent studyat UC-San Diego found that strict ID laws could be expected to depress the Latino vote turnout by 9.3 points, African-American turnout by 8.6 points, and Asian-American turnout by 12.5 points. This dispels the myth that voter ID laws don’t harm participation rates.

Additionally, wealthy Americansvote at much higher ratesthan low income Americans—and our economic policies reflect this. When low income Americans vote in greater numbers, elected officials implement more policies that serve them. We can no longer ignore how low voter participation affects the future of our country.

Grassroots organizers across the country are already working to connect the issues facing working families to the right to vote. This past weekend at the Congressional Progressive Caucus summit, we heard from Reverend William Barber II, organizer ofMoral Mondays, who emphasized the need to address voting rights.

While the right to vote is inherent throughout our nation’s founding documents, there is nothing in the Constitution that explicitly guarantees our right to vote.As authors ofa constitutional amendmentto affirm the right to vote, we believe it is crucial to frame Thursday’s debate around voting rights.

The people should be selecting their leaders, not the other way around. Our democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people.

Sincerely,

Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02)

WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) launched the bipartisan Congressional Rural Broadband Caucus with Reps. Peter Welch (D-VT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Bob Latta (R-OH) to facilitate discussion, educate Members of Congress and develop policy solutions to close the digital divide in rural America.

“Access to reliable, high-speed internet service is vital to economic growth in communities across America,”said Rep. Pocan.“Whether, it is for commerce, education or public safety needs, broadband service allows individuals and businesses in rural communities to take advantage of new technologies and stay connected to a 21st Century economy. There are many parts of my district where residents experience extremely slow download speeds even as low as one megabit per second.”

Several communities in Wisconsin’s Second Congressional District, including the towns of Vermont and Cross Plains, have publicly adopted resolutions voicing concerns over the lack of quality broadband service available to residents.

“Broadband access is not a luxury, rather it is a necessity,”Rep. Pocan continued.“I want to ensure people in my district, and across the country in rural areas, have updated broadband infrastructure and access to a reliable connection.”

A significant digital divide remains between urban and rural America: More than half of all rural Americans lack access to this basic standard of service. In 2015, the FCCupdated its broadband benchmark speeds to 25 megabits per second(Mbps) for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. According to the FCC, using this updated benchmark, the 2015 report finds that 55 million Americans – 17 percent of the population – lack access to advanced broadband.==

“Cooperatives create good paying jobs and offer both employees and local communities a chance to be directly involved in business decisions,” saidRep. Pocan.“I’m proud that my District is home to thriving cooperatives from the Willie Street Food Co-Op to UW Credit Union. I look forward to working with Rep. Royce to promote greater awareness of the cooperative business model and to advocate on federal policy issues unique to the co-op community.”

"Cooperatives not only provide valuable goods and services to consumers around the world, they also offer their members a piece of their success,” saidRep. Royce. “As a longtime advocate of cooperative businesses, from California’s credit unions and mutual insurers to Africa’s rural electric co-ops, I look forward to highlighting the benefits these organizations provide to their communities and customers."

Cooperatives can be found in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy from affordable housing, to quality sourced food, greater access to electricity, banking and credit needs, and for early childhood learning. Dane County, home to 80 cooperatives, has the highest number of co-ops per capita of any county in country.

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after President Obama delivered his final State of the Union Address in front of a joint session of Congress. Rep. PocaninvitedMadison Ald. Samba Baldeh, a local Muslim community leader, as his guest to the State of the Union Address to show solidarity with the American-Muslim community at a time of escalating bigotry and discrimination.

“At a time when our country faces complex challenges both home and abroad, the President delivered a positive, aspirational message on how we can meet these challenges through constructive cooperation between elected officials, community leaders and everyday Americans.

“The President stressed the tolerance of ideas and encouraged cooperation, things that I think elected in officials in Washington can agree are sorely needed. While this speech may have not contained a laundry list of specific policy items to tackle in 2016, I believe, as the President does, that we can find common ground on many important things here in Washington which will benefit the American people. Specifically, I am pleased the President mentioned criminal justice reform, as this is an issue I have been working on since my days in the Wisconsin State Assembly and something I hope to continue to fight for in the year ahead, as well as the need for a more fair redistricting and campaign finance process. The American people deserve a Congress that can rise to the occasion, find common ground, and get some things accomplished.

“As the President said, now is not the time to turn inwards as a nation and turn against each other as a people. Instead, we should join together to help make sure hard working Americans are getting a fair shot at the American Dream and that we leave this country a better place for the next generation. This begins with standing up to the hateful and vitriolic rhetoric directed at certain groups or individuals in our communities. It begins with celebrating the diversity of the American people and building off the past challenges we have overcome as a nation.”

Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) strongly opposes Gov. Scott Walker's comments, laid out in an interview Thursday that the state could ‘simply spend less on roadwork' in his next budget to keep his pledge not to raise taxes. Members of the Governor's own party have harshly criticized the continued underfunding of transportation infrastructure because it leaves roads, highways and bridges crumbling. Failure to invest in our bridges and roads will result in safety hazards, which are disruptive to travel and hurt our economy.

Last July, the U.S. Department of Transportation released areportlistingWisconsin as thethird worst state in the nation for highway infrastructure."Gov. Walker's last budget failed to provide critical infrastructure investments that the people and businesses in Wisconsin deserve,"said Rep. Pocan."Important construction projects have already been delayed. Our state should not have to endure dropping down to very last in the nation due to short-sighted budget promises the governor made while eyeing a presidential bid.""Last month, Congress finally passed a long-term, bipartisan Highway Funding bill. There is no excuse for not adequately funding Wisconsin's highways, bridges and roads,"continued Rep. Pocan."To follow Gov. Walker's budgeting advice would jeopardize public safety and disrupt economic growth in our state which has already dropped from 11thto 37thin job creation on his watch."# # #==

Baldeh. "As a Muslim man and a local elected official, I see firsthand the impact of anti-Muslim political rhetoric and debate on my community. The recent rise in anti-Muslim sentiment around the country is troubling and affects real people's lives every day. It drives me, as I know it does Rep. Pocan, to be an advocate for those fleeing persecution and to protect the rights and freedoms of our country."

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 passed the House reauthorizing Perkins Loans through Sept. 30, 2017. Rep. Pocan introduced the Higher Extension Act of 2015, which passed the House, along with his colleague Rep. Bishop (R-MI). Despite Rep. Pocan's efforts in the House, the Senate blocked the bill and allowed the program to expire on September 30, 2015."The Perkins Loans program has helped students in Wisconsin and all across the country struggling to find a way to pay for college,"Rep. Pocan said."While this bipartisan bill is not as expansive as I would like, I am pleased that students will still be able to access much-needed federal financial aid for another two years. After months of working on this issue with education groups, students, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I am relieved to see that this critical program will continue. I will tirelessly work with my colleagues to ensure Perkins Loans are available to both graduate and undergraduate students in the years to come.""For approximately 16,000 UW System students a year, Perkins loans have been an important source of financial aid as they pursue a degree,"said UW System President Ray Cross."We appreciate the leadership and partnership of Rep. Pocan and the Wisconsin Congressional delegation in helping continue this critical program for our students with financial need."

Since the inception of the Federal Perkins Loan program in 1958, over $28 billion dollars in loans have been made to students. The Federal Perkins Loan is a need-based loan, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need. Perkins Loans borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college.

In June 2015, Rep. Pocan introduced a bipartisanresolutionwith Rep. Messer (R-IN) and 56 cosponsors in support of Perkins Loans. In September 2015, Rep. Pocan also introduced theHigher Education Extension Act of 2015with Rep. Bishop (R-MI) to extend the program for a year, which passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate. Over 33 groups and higher educational institutions supported Perkins Loans reauthorization.==

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement afteran updated projectionfrom the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau showed a full Medicaid expansion allowed under Obamacare would save the state more than $1 billion through 2020-21:"If Governor Walker would just expand Medicaid, our state could save $1 billion. This is a staggering amount of money Wisconsin desperately needs to offset the haphazard budget cuts imposed by Gov. Walker. The fact is because of Walker's actions we are going to face an even worse budget next year, which will yet again fail to provide critical investment in programs that matter most to the people of Wisconsin."If we expanded Medicaid, an additional 83,000 Wisconsinites could receive health care coverage and save our state $1 billion dollars in the process. It would be a huge win for our state. Plus, I'm sure we could find a few things to use some of this $1 billion in savings on like restoring cuts to the University of Wisconsin system, properly funding school districts, or maybe even fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, for starters. Now that Gov. Walker is back in Wisconsin, hopefully we can find a path forward for our state that grows our economy and creates good paying jobs."==

Title: Pocan House Floor Statement on ESEA Reauthorization
Date: December 3, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, spoke on the House Floor in support of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Reauthorization, the Every Student Succeeds Act. The bipartisan bill passed the House last night by a vote of 359-64 and the Senate is expected to finalize it next week. This is the first reauthorization of the ESEA since the expiration of No Child Left Behind in 2007.

You can find a video clip of Rep. Pocan speaking on the Floorhere."I rise in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Defending public education is one of the reasons I came to Congress.

For years, we've witnessed a negative impact on public education from underfunding our schools and to stripping teachers of their rights to collectively bargain for fair pay and conditions. At the same time, punitive policies which limit teachers' and administrators' abilities to manage their classrooms have further hampered student achievement.

In my home state, attacks on public education are made on a regular basis. And nationally our dialogue surrounding K-12 education has lacked the input of local educators, parents and communities. It's past time we renew the promise of an ESEA which has students' best interests at heart.

I meet with teachers and administrators from Wisconsin's 2nd Congressional District regularly and was stunned when I was told one third of a school's staff turned over last year because schools lack the financial support and autonomy they need to give students the educational experience they deserve. Teachers are being asked to do more with less and it's coming at the expense of our kids' education.

A 2014 Alliance for Excellent Education student demonstrated that 13% of the nation's 3.4 million teachers move schools or leave the profession every year. Close to 40-50% of teachers leave the job entirely within 5 years of starting.

And while this bill is far from perfect, I am pleased that we are finally discussing a bill today that aims to put students first and trusts the teachers who dedicate their careers to education.

This bill trusts and empowers teachers to ensure their voices are heard on the federal, state, and local level while increasing teacher quality and professional development, and reducing the burden of testing in schools.

Those are good improvements, Mr. Speaker, good for our nation's children, and that's why I support this bill."==

Title: Pocan Introduces Legislation to Limit Corporate Tax Inversions
Date: November 9, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) introduced theCorporate Fair Share Tax Actand thePutting America First Corporate Actto prevent corporations from using "tax inversions" to reduce a company's U.S. tax burden and ensure they cannot avoid taxes by hiding profits overseas."It is wrong that Wall Street corporations are using tax loopholes to skirt their responsibilities while small business owners and hard-working Americans play by the rules,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."This legislation will eliminate a major incentive for corporations to leave the United States and ensure that companies pay their taxes on overseas profits immediately. We must stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system and force these companies to contribute their fair share."

Corporate inversion is a process by which an existing U.S. corporation shifts it's company's headquarters to a country with a smaller tax burden and assuming the label of a "foreign" corporation, even as business activity and general operations frequently remain on American soil. These firms utilize U.S. resources, infrastructure, and customer base while renouncing their American identity to avoid paying taxes in our country.

Recent reportshighlight a potential merger between Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical corporation, and Ireland-based drug company Allergan, a deal which may include Pfizer pursuing an inversion. This is just the latest example in a long list of United States corporations taking advantage of this massive loophole to avoid paying taxes.

Corporate Fair Share Tax Act

Policy summary:

This bill cracks down on corporate earnings stripping, a method of avoiding taxes in which U.S.-based groups are loaded up with debt owed to the affiliated foreign company; the U.S. entity then pays high levels of interest on this debt, which nets them significant tax deductions or wipes out taxable income in the U.S. Specifically, the legislation limits the deductions a corporation may claim to a level at which the U.S. entity's share of interest on debt is proportionate to the U.S. entity's share of earnings. The Treasury Department estimates this wouldincrease revenue by $48.6 billion over the next ten years.

Putting America First Corporate Tax Act

Policy summary:

Currently, corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign profits until that money is repatriated back to the U.S., often via dividends to shareholders. Our provision changes Section 952 of the tax code to close this loophole and require controlled foreign corporations to pay U.S. taxes on future active income beginning on December 31, 2014. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending this loophole wouldincrease revenue over the next ten years by $114 billion.

The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Keith Ellison (D-MN), John Garamendi (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC). The bills are also endorsed by Americans for Tax Fairness, Citizens for Tax Justice, Public Citizen, American Sustainable Business Council, and FACT Coalition.==

This deal, which encompasses 40 percent of the global economy, will send more American jobs overseas and lower wages. Our workers will now have to directly compete with workers making pocket change in countries like Vietnam. We should not be surprised that a trade deal negotiated in secret by 600 corporate advisors gives huge sweetheart deals to multinational corporations while producing disastrous results for the middle class."Not only would this deal ship jobs overseas, destroying our communities and local economies in the process, but the deal will also have a widespread effect on issues ranging from drug prices to environmental protections to food safety. It will also almost double the number of corporations with access to special non-judicial courts to challenge state and local laws. In the end the TPP was worse than we thought it would be."==
Title: As Veterans Day Approaches Sen. Schatz & Reps. Pocan, Rangel Urge Congress to Pass Restore Honor to Service Members Act

Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Members of the LGBT Equality Caucus urged the passage of the Restore Honor to Service Members Act at a press conference on Capitol Hill. The legislation would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned."We have a sacred commitment to every American who serves in our military. But for the 100,000 brave Americans who were forced out for being gay, we have failed to honor that commitment,"said Senator Schatz. "The Restore Honor to Service Members Act would give these veterans a chance to correct their military records—to remove an unwarranted discharge that was given to them for no other reason than being gay. It would remove the mark of shame they carry, give them access to benefits, and finally give them the respect and honor they rightly deserve.""As we approach Veterans Day, it's important to remember the sacrifices our veterans have made for our country,"said Rep. Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. "This includes the selfless service of more than 100,000 veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Our legislation ensures that gay veterans who served our country no longer live with tarnished records that prohibit them from receiving the recognition, benefits and honors they deserve.""As a veteran, I know that our men and women in uniform give all to serve our country with great honor,"said Rep. Rangel. "We can no longer delay honoring these veterans who deserve long overdue recognition. We struck down ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell' and legalized same sex marriage. Love is not dishonorable."

Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of "other than honorable," "general discharge" or "dishonorable," depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.

The legislation is supported by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, VoteVets.org, OutServe-SLDN, the Human Rights Campaign, American Veterans for Equal Rights, Lambda Legal, Swords to Plowshares, the American Bar Association, Universal Unitarian Association, and the American Humanist Association.

In addition to Representatives Pocan and Rangel, The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has109 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and37 cosponsorsin the Senate.# # #==

Oscar Mayer was a source of good paying jobs and a valuable asset to Dane County. I am deeply concerned for the hundreds of employees and their families who have just found out they can no longer expect to come to work at this facility as they have for many years now."Since Heinz took over Kraft and Oscar Mayer, their commitment to the corporate bottom line over the interests of individual workers and the communities they live in has, unfortunately, been repeated across the country. Given the company's indication that they will instead expand operations elsewhere in North America, my office is prepared to assist should workers qualify for trade adjustment assistance. I will work with state and local officials to provide necessary assistance to the workers who have just endured this terrible loss."==

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) released the following statement after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instructionannouncedthe number of students attending private schools on state-funded vouchers more than doubled since enrollment caps were lifted. Nearly, 75 percent of students in the newly expanded program were already enrolled in private schools and only 19 percent of new statewide enrollees came from the public-school system. The total cost for the statewide program is estimated to be $18.3 million for the 2015-2016 school year. According to theWisconsin State Journal, during the '16-17 school year, the state will spend $258 million on taxpayer-funded vouchers and will reduce public school funding by $83 million."This new data clearly shows that the Wisconsin taxpayer- funded voucher program doesn't exist to help students in need,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."The Wisconsin taxpayers are paying tuition to students already enrolled in private schools, while our public schools struggle to cover basic infrastructure needs. Not only are voucher schools selecting which students they educate, often turning down students with special needs, but they also operate with little to no oversight or transparency. Let's be clear: public education is fundamental part of a government's responsibility to its citizens. Public funds should only be used for public education."==

Washington, D.C – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) stood with University of Wisconsin-Madison students and administrators to call on the Senate to immediately pass theHigher Education Extension Act of 2015to prevent the Perkins Loan Program from lapsing any longer. Rep. PocanintroducedtheHigher Education Extension Act of 2015,which passed the House, along with his colleague Rep. Bishop (R-MI). Despite Rep. Pocan's efforts in the House, the Senate blocked the bill and allowed the program to expire on September 30, 2015."There is no excuse for the Senate to let Perkins Loans expire and turn their back on the thousands of students all across the country who rely on them to make college accessible,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Members of the House were able to come together in a bipartisan fashion to pass a reauthorization of the Perkins Loan program. By denying access to these low-interest loans, students and families are left with very few options to cover college expenses. With skyrocketing college tuition costs, Congress should be doing everything it can to ensure students can attend college without being weighed down with mountains of debt."

The program, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need, expired on September 30th. The Senate must act soon so new students and families who are applying for financial aid for the upcoming school year are able to access this vital program. Students who have previously received Perkins loans during the 2015-2016 academic year or before will be eligible to be grandfathered into the program and receive loans through the end of their academic program or up to 5 years if they stay at the same school and do not change their major.

In June 2015, Rep. Pocan introduced a bipartisanresolutionwith Rep. Messer (R-IN) and 56 cosponsors in support of Perkins Loans. Earlier this month, Rep. Pocanled a press conferencewith Rep. Slaughter (D-NY), education advocacy organizations and students to urge Congress to reauthorize the program. Rep.

The full text of the letter is below and a signed version can be foundhere.

Dear President Obama:

We write today to express concerns about the potential conflict between free trade rules and the urgency to address climate change. Climate change is an enormous threat to our nation and our planet, and the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris is a key opportunity for the global community to agree to a strong framework to combat the crisis. As the administration pushes towards an agreement in Paris, we must not let trade rules, including those incorporated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) undercut the prospects for or implementation of a strong climate deal.

In recent years we have witnessed an alarming rise of international trade and investment disputes related to renewable energy and climate policies. Foreign investors and corporations are increasingly using investment rules in free trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties to challenge climate and clean energy policies. Recently there has been a significant increase in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) cases in which corporations bring legal action against governments with policies contradicting the parameters of a trade agreement. In fact, since 2011 the number of ISDS cases, which often target environmental regulations and standards, has exploded to an average of nearly fifty cases each year.

In order to combat the climate crisis every nation will need to transition to a new, low carbon future. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but countries and localities will need flexibility to realize this goal. All countries should be incentivized to implement policies to combat climate change. For this reason, we cannot adopt trade rules, which empower foreign investors to challenge state and federal renewable energy programs.

The Paris climate deal and free trade agreements cannot be discussed in silos. Further, the United States must not perpetuate the ability of foreign companies to undermine sovereign governments' efforts to combat climate change. We urge the administration to ensure no provisions within any trade agreement under consideration by the United States undermine the ability of countries to reach or implement a strong agreement to address climate change.

Title: Members of Congress to TSA – Reform Screening Procedures for Transgender Passengers
Date: October 8, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC –Today, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Brian Higgins (D-NY) along with twenty-nine other congressional colleagues senta letterto the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administration Peter Neffenger urging changes in the way that the agency screens transgender passengers. The letter comes on the heels of reports of a transgender traveler, Shadi Petosky, being detained and put through inappropriate airport security screening procedures by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) at the Orlando International Airport due to a misunderstanding about her gender identity as a trans-woman. The Members urge the TSA to adopt a screening protocol that does not rely on Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) making often-subjective decisions about an individual's gender identity. The letter also requests the TSA provide guidance on screening procedures to the transgender community, ensure that TSA personnel receive adequate training on gender identity issues, and requests the TSA to participate in the investigations by the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services into Ms. Petosky's case.

In the letter, the Members write: "It is a sad reality that members of the transgender community face adversity every day. The experiences of many transgender airline passengers such as Ms. Petosky demonstrate that more must be done to ensure transgender individuals are able to travel without fear of facing humiliation or degradation at security checkpoints. While being mindful of enacting the appropriate security precautions to keep all travelers safe, the TSA must also take steps to ensure that its employees are prepared to serve transgender individuals with the dignity, discretion, and respect that they, like all Americans, deserve."

Joining Schiff, Pocan and Higgins in signing the letter were Reps. Donald S. Beyer, Jr. (D-VA), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), Judy Chu (D-CA), David N. Cicilline (D-RI), Katherine Clark (D-MA), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Sam Farr (D-CA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Steve Israel (D-NY), William R. Keating (D-MA), Joseph P. Kennedy (D-MA), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Jim McDermott (D-WA), James P. McGovern (D-MA), Patrick Murphy (D-FL), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Scott Peters (D-CA), Kathleen M. Rice (D-NY), Adam Smith (D-WA), Jackie Speier (D-CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), Dina Titus (D-NV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) and Jared Polis (D-CO). The text is below:

Dear Administrator Neffenger:

We write to express our strong concerns regarding the treatment of transgender individuals by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). As you know, a transgender traveler, Shadi Petosky has reported that, on September 21, 2015, she was detained by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) at the Orlando International Airport due to a misunderstanding about her gender identity as a trans-woman. Unfortunately, Ms. Petosky's experience is just the latest of a string of reports from travelers across the country. In the days since Ms. Petosky's story became public, we have heard from numerous members of the transgender community describing harassing and humiliating experiences while going through airport security. While we understand the importance of vigilant airport security, we cannot countenance a security protocol that subjects transgender travelers to this level of indignity. To that end, we urge TSA to complete a thorough review of its current procedures and address any shortcomings that may, however unintentionally, subject transgender travelers to inequitable or improper treatment by security personnel.

First, TSA must recognize its procedures regarding the use of full-body scanners present unique challenges for transgender passengers. As you know, TSOs must select a male or female button in order to configure a scanner to a gender-specific setting prior to screening. Under this system, an error-free reading of a passenger's scan image relies on a TSO making a discretionary determination about a passenger's sex based on their appearance rather than the gender with which they identify. This protocol may be well-suited to screen some cisgender passengers, but they do so at the expense of singling out transgender or gender nonconforming individuals whose physical appearances may not necessarily match their biological sex. In light of this issue, we urge the TSA to implement a screening protocol that does not rely on TSOs making often-subjective decisions about an individual's gender identity. As evidenced by Ms. Petosky's experience and the myriad other stories we have heard recently, such a protocol can put transgender passengers at greater risk of being incorrectly screened, thereby unduly requiring them to undergo a "pat down" -- an additional procedure which many have found to be extremely invasive and degrading.

Second, we believe there is insufficient guidance on TSA screening procedures readily available to the transgender community. For example, while the current screening process seems to suggest that it is incumbent upon a transgender passenger to inform personnel of his or her gender identification prior to screening, such a policy has not been published on the TSA's website or made widely known to the public. Additionally, while TSA has stated transgender passengers may request a private screening, it is unclear based on publicly-available information what a private screening entails, whether a private screening can be requested in lieu of a full-body scanner, or at what point in the security screening process it should be requested. Moreover, there exists no public guidance to reassure transgender travelers that they will not have to reveal the use of any prosthetic devices or binding materials while in a public area. To ensure transgender passengers are fully informed about all security screening expectations, we request that the TSA publishes detailed guidelines on its website to address these commonly asked questions, among others, and to include a clear explanation of the civil rights protections to which all transgender passengers are entitled to during the screening process. Further, we request more prominent visibility of the TSA Cares helpline and other available resources on the TSA website so those with additional questions have a clear and accessible way to gather information on remaining concerns.

In addition, we request that all TSA personnel are adequately trained to serve the transgender community. It is insufficient to provide only TSO supervisors with "cultural awareness training." We ask that such trainings should be required for all TSOs that work with the public, that they be held live and in-person (as opposed to the simple distribution of written materials), and that these trainings specifically cover the particular sensitivities and vulnerabilities of transgender travelers.

Finally, we are pleased to hear that the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have launched an investigation into Ms. Petosky's case to determine whether there were any civil rights violations. We request the TSA's full cooperation in this investigation and urge the TSA to maintain transparency by sharing the results of the probe with transgender community advocacy organizations and with the undersigned.

It is a sad reality that members of the transgender community face adversity every day. The experiences of many transgender airline passengers such as Ms. Petosky demonstrate that more must be done to ensure transgender individuals are able to travel without fear of facing humiliation or degradation at security checkpoints. While being mindful of enacting the appropriate security precautions to keep all travelers safe, the TSA must also take steps to ensure that its employees are prepared to serve transgender individuals with the dignity, discretion, and respect that they, like all Americans, deserve. We appreciate your willingness to engage on this important issue. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Title: Sanders, Pocan Introduce Legislation to Strengthen Workers’ Rights

WASHINGTON, D.C. –Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) introduced legislation today that would make it easier for workers to join unions and bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.

"The Workplace Democracy Act strengthens the middle class by restoring workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions,"said Rep. Pocan. "One of the root causes of declining wages is that workers' ability to join together and bargain for higher wages and better working conditions has been has been severely undermined. This bill would make it easier for workers to have a voice in the workplace, providing a bigger paycheck to middle class families trying to pay the mortgage and find a way to send their kids to college.""Millions of Americans who want to join unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers,"Sen. Sanders said. "The benefits of joining a union are clear: higher wages, better benefits and a more secure retirement. If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country."

The Workplace Democracy Act will make it easier for workers to join a union by allowing the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards. The bill also requires companies to begin negotiating within 10 days after certification. If no first contract is reached after 90 days, either party can request compulsory mediation. After 30 days of mediation, the parties will submit the remaining issues to binding arbitration.

Joining Sanders and Pocan at the news conference outside the Capitol were workers who have faced retaliation for trying to organize their fellow workers. "Working moms shouldn't have to strike and face threats just to join a union,"said Kellie Duckett, a federal contract worker at the U.S. Capitol. "We should be able sign up for the union just like we sign up for the PTA.""I'm here to say that current labor laws don't protect workers,"Mayra Tito, a federal contract worker, added. "I should know – I was fired from the Pentagon Starbucks after I went on strike for $15 and a union. That's why we need the Workplace Democracy Act.""I was fired for speaking out in my workplace to improve patient care conditions by organizing a union," Allysha Almad, a registered nurse from Pasadena, said. "My case is not unique. There are thousands of nurses and other workers who face retaliation when they try to raise their voices collectively to address unsafe condition – conditions that in hospitals and other workplaces actually endanger lives."

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this year, union workers' wages are 27 percent greater than for non-union workers. Seventy-nine percent of unionized workers receive health insurance from their employers, compared to only 49 percent of non-union workers. Seventy-six percent of union workers have guaranteed defined-benefit pension plans, compared to only 16 percent of non-union workers. Eighty-three percent of union workers receive paid with sick leave compared to only 62 percent of non-union workers.

The bill is cosponsored in the House by Reps. Rosa DeLauro, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Cheri Bustos, John Conyers, Matt Cartwright, Marcy Kaptur, Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, Mark Takano, Don Norcross, Charlie Rangel, Raul Grijalva, Judy Chu, Marcia Fudge, Janice Hahn and in the Senate by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii).

Title: Pocan Calls for Immediate Release of Trans-Pacific Partnership Text
Date: October 5, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C -U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) calls for the immediate release of the Trans-Pacific Partnership text today after negotiators in Atlanta reached a final deal with the 12 countries involved:"Now that a final deal has been reached the Administration owes it to the American people to immediately release the full text of the TPP. This negotiating process has not been transparent, despite claims from the USTR. The secretive nature of these negotiations is compounded by the pressure to throw together this deal based on the political timelines of negotiating partners is worrisome. These negotiations, which have been conducted almost entirely in secret, are even more concerning given our apparent adherence to political timelines with little regard to the interests of U.S. workers."Reports throughout the course of the negotiating process raise serious questions about the impact of this agreement on a number of areas, ranging from workplace and environmental protections to food safety. Initial reports indicate that labor standards remain subpar, currency manipulation has not been adequately addressed, rules of origin for autos have been weakened and human rights issues in countries like Malaysia and Brunei have not been dealt with properly. Along with these concerns, corporations still have the ability to supersede the laws of our country through the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) process."Past trade deals have been a disaster for American workers, so it is imperative Congress rigorously reviews this deal to ensure the American people are not being taken for a ride yet again."==

I will always remember his pivotal leadership and constant presence throughout the weeks of protests following the introduction of Act 10 in 2011."Marty was strong voice for working families in Wisconsin and a firm believer that when we all do better, we all do better.

Washington, D.C -U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan(D-WI) released the following statement after Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) blocked the passage of theHigher Education Extension Act of 2015, effectively halting the reauthorization of Perkins Loans. Pocanintroducedthe House version of this bill along with his colleague Rep. Bishop (R-MI), which passed Monday. This legislation would have ensured students have access to this important loan program for another year. The Federal Perkins Loan is a need-based loan, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need."Senator Alexander has turned his back on the more than 500,000 students who rely on the Perkins Loan program to help pay for college,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "Members of the House were able to come together in a bipartisan fashion, along with the support of hundreds of colleges and universities, to pass a reauthorization of the Perkins Loan program, but today one Senator from Tennessee felt it necessary to undo all of that. This is exactly why the American people are so frustrated with Congress. There is no program to take the place of the Perkins Loan, so the Senator has effectively cut off this avenue for students struggling to find financial aid for college."

In June 2015, Rep. Pocan introduced a bipartisanresolutionwith Rep. Messer (R-IN) and 56 cosponsors in support of Perkins Loans. Earlier this month, Rep. Pocanled a press conferencewith Rep. Slaughter (D-NY), education advocacy organizations and students to urge Congress to reauthorize the program. Rep. Louise Slaughter also authored a letter with 94 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program. Over 33 groups and higher educational institutions supported this bill's reauthorization.# # #==
Title: Pocan Introduces HIV Clinical Services Improvement Act

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) introduced theHIV Clinical Services Improvement Acttoday, a bill which improves health care access for people living with HIV/AIDs by strengthening Ryan White Part C clinics. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program provides medical care for people living with HIV/AIDS who do not have adequate health coverage or resources to cope with the disease. Part C clinics deliver quality, comprehensive HIV/AIDs care to over 275,000 people a year. These clinics, which serve a large number of uninsured and low-income individuals, are underfunded and in desperate need of increased resources in order to assist patients.

TheHIV Clinical Services Improvement Act,introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin, authorizes all Part C clinics to be eligible for enhanced Medicaid funding and allows Part C clinics to expand their operations to care for the growing number of vulnerable HIV/AIDs population. Since 2001, the number of Part C clinics has increased by 74 percent, while funding only increased by 8 percent highlighting the need for improved support for these clinics."Improving access to health care for people living with HIV/AIDS in our communities is critical,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."There is an estimated 8,200 people living with HIV in Wisconsin, but only 63 percent of those diagnosed were receiving health care. This bill will increase support for Part C clinics so they can continue providing vital care to those most in need. We must take all necessary steps to improve access to care for people living with HIV/AIDS.""Senator Baldwin and Representative Pocan's leadership is truly commendable. Unfettered access to high quality health care for people with HIV is a key component of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy,"said Aids Resource Center of Wisconsin President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Gifford."Today in the United States, the difference between a long, healthy life or rapid disease progression and significant illness for HIV patients is having a primary care physician who is knowledgeable about treating HIV disease. This bill will make sure that more Americans with HIV have access to this care.""The Ryan White Medical Providers Coalition greatly appreciates Representatives Pocan and Lee's long-standing support of HIV programs and the clients they serve. By introducing legislation that would authorize eligible Ryan White Part C medical clinics to receive enhanced Medicaid funding, this bill would help ensure that people living with HIV/AIDS have access to life-saving, comprehensive, and effective HIV care and treatment,"said Ryan White Medical Providers Coalition Co-Chair Dr. Michelle Ogle."Congress should pass this bill swiftly to help the nation achieve its goal of an AIDS-free generation as quickly as possible."

TheHIV Clinical Services Improvement Actis currently cosponsored by HIV/AIDS Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) and Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) and is also supported by the AIDS Resources Center of Wisconsin, AIDS United, Ryan White Medical Providers Coalition, and the HIV Medicine Association.==
Title: Pocan’s Bill to Reauthorize Perkins Loan Program Passes House

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) gave the following remarks on the House Floor in support of the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015,H.R. 3594, which passed the House this afternoon. The bill, introduced by Reps. Pocan and Rep. Mike Bishop (R-MI), reauthorizes the Federal Perkins Loans program for one year before it is set to expire on September 30th. The Federal Perkins Loan is a need-based loan, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need. A video of Rep. Pocan's remarks can be foundhere."I rise today in support of H.R. 3549, the Higher Education Extension Act. And I would like my colleague Mr. Bishop and my colleagues Mrs. Slaughter, Mr. Messer and Ranking Member Scott for their leadership on this issue.

This bill would extend the Perkins Loan Program for one year. Perkins Loans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need.

Colleges and Universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers' and institutions' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program with institutions contributing one-third of their students' awards. This "ownership interest" also contributes to the successful management of this vital program.

We have only TWO days before the Perkins Loans program is set to expire so we must act immediately.

Since its inception in 1958, over $28 billion dollars in loans have been made to students through almost 26 million aid awards. Perkins Loans borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. Perkins Loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to accrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. However this program has not been reauthorized since 2009.

Besides making higher education accessible for low-income students, this program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into public service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific progression in areas of national need including teaching, nursing, and law enforcement.

Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of Perkins Loans with Congressman Messer, H. Res. 294 with 56 cosponsors. My colleague, Rep. Louise Slaughter, a leader on this issue, authored a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program. Over 33 groups and higher educational institutions have supported this bill's reauthorization.

Bottom line: The Perkins Loans program has helped millions of students and families struggling to find a way to pay for college. I applaud my colleagues across the aisle, specifically a thank you to Mr. Bishop, for helping to ensure students have access to the federal financial aid they need to make college accessible and affordable. I urge support of this bill.

I reserve the balance of my time."==

Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) urges Gov. Walker to call a special session to address Wisconsin's crumbling infrastructure after the Department of Transportation announced the Verona Road construction project will be delayed due to transportation funding cuts in the state's budget. Phase two of construction, previously scheduled for 2016 and 2017, is now delayed until 2019 and 2020; the road will not be completed until 2021. This comes after the July 2015 release of aDepartment of Transportation State by State Ranking, listing Wisconsin as the third worst state in the nation for highway infrastructure."Once again, Governor Walker's budget fails to provide critical investment in programs that matter most to the people of Wisconsin. Building safe roads is a basic function of good government. Unfortunately, the state of Wisconsin can't seem to do even that,"said Rep. Pocan."Wisconsin is rated third worst in the nation for highway infrastructure with a staggering 71 percent of Wisconsin's roads in poor or mediocre condition. Now important construction projects are being delayed. Cleary, Wisconsin is doing something wrong.""Wisconsin's infrastructure is being compromised due to budget cuts on the state level and exacerbated by Republicans in Washington who refuse to address a long-term plan for the Highway Trust Fund,"continued Rep. Pocan."We cannot continue to jeopardize our public safety by failing to provide adequate funds for transportation projects. It is inexcusable that much-needed transportation investments are being delayed. The people of Wisconsin deserve better."

In 2014, Rep. Pocan visited both the Verona Road and I-90 transportation project sites and participated in a transportation roundtable that took place adjacent to I-90 near Edgerton and included U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.# # #==

Grijalva (D-AZ), senta lettertoday to Speaker John Boehner urging him to work with Congressional Democrats in order to avoid another government shutdown. There are currently only five legislative days left for Speaker Boehner to find a solution to keep the government open."We seem to have short memories here in Congress, but the last time the Tea Party engineered a government shutdown, our economy lost $24 billion and 120,000 jobs,"said Rep. Pocan."As a member of the Budget Committee and a small business owner for nearly 30 years, I know businesses and workers across the country struggle to cope with this continual fiscal uncertainty and legislative chaos. Our economic growth should not be jeopardized because a small number of right wing extremists want to cut access to health care services for millions of Americans. Forcing a government shutdown is not the action of responsible adults and I urge Speaker Boehner to work with Democrats to keep our government open. It's time for Congress to grow up.""A Republican-led government shutdown would not only wreak havoc on our economy, but it would also further delay action on finding a long term fix to the Highway Trust Fund, reforming our broken immigration system, and many other important issues that need attention,"said Rep. Ellison."But worst of all, a shutdown will negatively affect millions of people, as it will stop the paychecks that hundreds of thousands of Americans depend on to put food on the table. It will also prevent seniors and veterans from getting the benefits they need to make ends meet and keep children out of head start educational programs. If the Republican Leadership chooses to cede power to the most extreme members of the Republican caucus, working Americans, seniors, military veterans, and students will be hit hardest. I urge Speaker Boehner to work with Members of Congress who recognize that the American people do not want, and cannot afford another government shutdown.""It is a sad fact about politics today that the American people are faced with a government shutdown every time a new fiscal year begins in Washington,"said Rep. Grijalva. "As the list mounts of urgent issues Republicans are neglecting, the American people are left to wonder why they're facing another self-inflicted wound from people elected to lead this nation. We're not asking for a lot from GOP leaders – just for them stop holding the American economy hostage over partisan demands."

The text of the letter is below and a signed letter can be foundhere.

The Honorable John BoehnerSpeakerU.S. House of RepresentativesWashington, DC 20515

Dear Speaker Boehner,

As the leadership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,we write to urge you to work with Congressional Democrats in order to keep the government open.

There are currently5legislative days scheduled before the start of the new fiscal year. We remain deeply concerned about the economic impacts of the shutdown on the American people.

The 2013 government shutdown not only undermined people's faith in our government domestically and internationally, it cost the American taxpayers$24 billion dollars. On September 18, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen further warned that a government shutdown would jeopardize the country's economic health. Shutting down the government is not only irresponsible;it is costly and risks Americans' economic security.

Congress' to-do list is growing. Before the end of the year, Congress must pass a transportation and infrastructure bill, a number of tax-extenders, the child nutrition reauthorization, Perkins Loan Program reauthorization, the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, raise the debt ceiling, and update the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, among many other priorities.Given this, we urge you to work with the Members of Congress who are unwilling to risk the economic security of Americans, and avoid a government shutdown.

Here's a snapshot of the numbers from the last shutdown:-19,000children served by Head Start grants lost access to their school facilities

-2 billiondollars was lost as a result of payroll costs or lost productivity of furloughed workers

-800+U.S. Department of Agriculture food safety inspections were delayed

-40,000+veterans' disability claims were stalled

-700small business applications were unable to be processed, amounting in $140 million in delayed loans.-1,400military service members experienced delays in services aimed to ease their transition into civilian life

-Hundredsof critically sick Americans were prevented from enrolling in National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials – with 98 percent of the National Science Foundation, nearly three-quarters of NIH, and two-thirds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees furloughed

As you move forward with negotiations, keep in mind the serious economic impact of the shutdown on American families and work with Congressional Democrats and Members who recognize we cannot afford another shutdown.

Sincerely,

Keith Ellison

Raúl M. Grijalva

This Pope has a startling presence, breaking all "molds" by his simplicity, directness, courage, and ability to touch hearts and minds with his words and presence. I will be honored by this "once in a lifetime" opportunity to be in his presence and experience his holiness."==

Title: Pocan Introduces Next Generation Researchers Act
Date: September 9, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced the Next Generation Researchers Act which aims to promote and provide opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence. Groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone added more than $57.8 billion in new economic activity and the creation of over 400,000 jobs across the country in 2012. Unfortunately, current policies are putting the brakes on research and innovation at a time when we need to step on the accelerator.

The Next Generation Researchers Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME), creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director and also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can invest in the next generation of research."Investing in research, innovation, science, and technology today is vital to our long-term economic growth,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."By providing our young scientists and researchers with more funding opportunities we will provide them with the support necessary to tackling the challenges of tomorrow. The pioneering efforts of these new researchers, in areas such as biochemistry and neuroscience, will lead to improved health and quality of life for Americans and spurs innovation, U.S. economic growth, and job creation."

Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget. These destructive policies are particularly devastating for our nation's young researchers like UW-Madison graduate students Tyler and Andrew."One of the biggest challenges my colleagues and I face as we transition from PhD students to postdoctoral researchers is the lack of career and funding opportunities for young researchers,"said Tyler Stanage, graduate student Cox Lab Biochemistry Department at UW-Madison."This has dissuaded the majority of my colleagues from pursuing careers in academic research - an incredible loss to the potential economic, medical, and scholarly advances they may have brought with their work.""I frequently hear about the difficulties scientists face in obtaining grants for research, and it can be discouraging,"said Andrew Merluzzi, graduate student in the Neuroscience and Public Policy Program at UW-Madison. "The uncertainty in funding makes a career in basic research much less enticing, which is an unfortunate fact. I think we need mechanisms by which young researchers can obtain the funds they need to get innovative ideas off the ground. I hope that legislation like the Next Generation Researchers Act can help do that."

The Next Generation Researchers Act currently has 9 original cosponsors and is supported by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Medical College of Wisconsin, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), FASEB, Research!America, American Society of Transplantation (AST) American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), American Heart Association, and AcademyHealth.==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Slaughter Urge Congress to Save Perkins Loan Program
Date: September 9, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY) stood with education advocacy organizations and students to urge Congress to reauthorize the Federal Perkins Loan program before it expires on September 30th. The Federal Perkins Loan is a need-based loan, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need."A college education open doors to greater job opportunities and financial stability. At a time where higher education costs are skyrocketing, Congress needs to do everything it can to ensure that students are able to attend college without being weighed down with mountains of debt,"said Rep. Pocan."The Perkins Loan Program is a vital tool to help make college accessible and affordable for all students. Perkins Loans have helped students struggling to find a way to pay for college in Wisconsin. I urge my Congressional Colleagues to reauthorize this program and ensure students have the ability to attend college without being held back by debt."

Nationwide, over 500,000 students are awarded Perkins Loans every year. These student borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. 67% of Perkins borrowers are dependent students, in which 34% of them come from families with household incomes of less than $30,000. Last year, the University of Wisconsin System awarded $28.8 million dollars in loans to 15,829 students during the '13-'14 school year. If the Perkins Loan is eliminated, students in Wisconsin, New York and across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid."Last week, I stood with the college and university presidents in my district representing over 6,000 students who receive Perkins funds to call for immediate action to save the Perkins Loan Program,"said Rep. Slaughter."Perkins Loans are special and a good investment all around: they are available to low-income students, have a low, capped interest rate, and are administered by the colleges and paid back to that college, creating a revolving system. Students should be studying for their next exam, not worrying whether they can afford their next semester. The loss of Perkins Loans would be an unrecoverable blow to the 500,000 students across the country who rely on them."

In June 2015, Rep. Pocan along with Rep. Messer (R-IN) introduced a bipartisanresolution, with 50 cosponsors, in support of the Perkins Loan Program. A broad coalition of education, financial aid groups, and colleges support the Perkins Loans Program. Rep. Slaughter (D-NY) also sent a bipartisanletterlast week, along with 94 of her colleagues, to the leaders of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce urging immediate action to save the Perkins Loan Program.==

Hodges.The lettercomes in response to recent events in Kentucky where a county clerk unconstitutionally refused marriage licenses to same-sex couples."The Supreme Court once again demonstrated marriage equality is the law of the land,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."The unconstitutional actions by this county clerk underscore the need for the Department of Justice to take any and all necessary steps to ensure same-sex couples have immediate and complete access to their fundamental right to marry. States and localities failing to comply with the Constitution should be met with swift action by the federal government including the loss of federal dollars. There is simply no excuse for discrimination in our democracy."

In July, Rep. Pocan along with 56 of his Congressional colleagues senta letterto the Department of Justice urging the Department to take any actions necessary to ensure same-sex couples are not denied marriage licenses.

Full text of the letter is below:

The Honorable Loretta E. Lynch

The Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Attorney General Lynch:

In July, 56 of my Congressional Colleagues and I wrote to the Department of Justice regarding our concerns about state and local officials defying the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergfell v. Hodges. I write today to follow up on that initial letter and to continue urging the Department of Justice to take the appropriate steps to ensure all states and localities act in compliance with this ruling.

Recent events in Kentucky where a county clerk unconstitutionally refused marriage licenses to same sex couples underscores the urgent need for action by the federal government to ensure discrimination does not persist. If this violation of the Constitution is left unchecked in Kentucky, I am deeply concerned that other same-sex couples will face discrimination across the country. Same-sex couples must be afforded immediate and complete access to the rights and responsibilities bestowed by the Supreme Court of the United States without delay. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan

Member of Congress

Title: On 50th Anniversary of Voting Rights Act Rep. Pocan Calls for Renewed Effort to Ensure Right to Vote

Washington, D.C – On the 50thanniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), 1st Vice Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, calls for a renewed effort to ensure the right to vote."As we mark the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, we recognize that our country has made tremendous progress as a result of civil rights advocates' hard work and commitment," said Rep. Mark Pocan. "But the foundation of our democracy, the right to vote, is being eroded away in state after state. The 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder further restricted access to the ballot box, making it harder for citizens to vote."

While the right to vote is essential to our democracy, according tothe Brennan Center for Justice, at least 83 restrictive bills were introduced in 29 states in 2014, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment,H.J.Res.25, would amend the U.S. Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and protect this fundamental right."The principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen is fundamental to our political system," continued Rep. Mark Pocan. "While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution in fact contains no expressed guarantee of an individual's right to vote. That is why Rep. Keith Ellison and I have introduced an amendment to the Constitution enshrining the right to vote. Passage of this amendment will guarantee every American would have the right to vote, and the ability to protect their individual rights and freedoms."==

Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), 1st Vice Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, released the following statement in support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which effectively halts the Iranian Nuclear Program, and provides the U.S. and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) unprecedented access to monitor Iran's nuclear sites."Since the announcement of the historic Iran deal, I've had the chance to carefully review the proposed plan and consult with members of the Obama Administration and numerous independent experts. What's clear is that ensuring Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon is paramount to the safety and security of the Middle East and the global community. Decades of sanctions have not prevented Iran from pursuing nuclear capabilities, but with this diplomatic agreement I firmly believe we now have the opportunity to verifiably prevent a nuclear Iran by supporting and implementing this deal."This agreement effectively halts the Iranian Nuclear Program, and provides unprecedented access to monitor Iran's nuclear sites. Ninety-eight percent of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile will be removed and 13,000 centrifuges used in the production of nuclear material will be shut down and placed in storage. There will be strict limits placed on research, development and testing of advanced nuclear technology for the next ten years. After this initial period Iran will still be subjected to restrictions limiting enrichment to a level consistent with a peaceful nuclear program."Some of these transparency measures will last for decades, but the IAEA inspections are permanent giving the U.S. an unparalleled understanding of Iran's nuclear program. If in the decades to come Iran tries to build a nuclear weapon we will be better prepared to detect and respond to this threat. If Congress strikes down this deal it could only hasten Iran's ability to obtain a nuclear weapon and our global partners, including China and Russia, may have no reason to continue international sanctions. This agreement is based on stringent accountability measures to ensure Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon."It took years of difficult diplomatic negotiations to reach this deal and I will actively work to ensure my colleagues stand with the President and other world leaders who have signed onto this historic agreement."==

Washington, D.C – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), along with Reps. Jared Polis (D-CO), Joe Heck (R-NV), and Phil Roe (R-TN), members of the House Education and Workforce Committee, introduced theSimplifying the Application for Student Aid Act,H.R. 3177, a bill which would simplify the student financial aid process."Federal financial aid is essential to ensure that college is accessible for students in Wisconsin and all across the country,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."The current student financial aid application process is overly complex and often results in students missing opportunities to receive much needed aid. Allowing students and families to access financial aid information earlier provides them with the opportunity to make better-informed decisions about their higher education plans. This bipartisan legislation will ensure more students are able to access federal financial aid to make college more affordable.""I applaud Rep. Pocan for his leadership in using "Prior Prior Year" in the Federal student aid application process. This important legislation is nothing short of transformational for students who rely on financial aid to attend college,"said Susan Fischer, Director of Financial Aid at UW-Madison."This straightforward change will allow families to report more accurate information on the FAFSA, will allow earlier submission of the FAFSA and ultimately allow for earlier aid notification by schools. This bill is extremely important to especially first generation students who may be on the fence regarding attending a post-secondary school; it is quite simply a win-win proposition.""One of our top priorities is providing more students easier access to an affordable, quality higher education,"said Ray Cross, President of the University of Wisconsin System. "Making income data available earlier and more accessible for families—particularly families with low-income and first-generation students—gives them the time, support, and confidence they need to make one of the most important decisions and investments of their lives."

TheSimplifying the Application for Student Aid Actwould allow students to use family income data from two years prior to the date of the FAFSA application. It would also allow income tax data to be automatically inputted into the FAFSA forms and give universities more time to verify the income of their students. The bill currently has 19 original cosponsors, including 9 Republican Members of Congress.

Rep. Pocan, along with a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members previously sent aletterto Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan asking the Department of Ed to allow students to use prior-prior income data.# # #==

Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a Co-Chair of the Equality Caucus, released the following statement after helping introduce the Equality Act, legislation to ban discrimination against LGBT individuals in public accommodations, housing, employment, and other core areas of daily life.Image

"The Supreme Court's historic marriage equality ruling means same-sex couples across the country can now marry freely, but in a majority of states you can still be fired simply because of who you love,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "This patchwork system of state laws leaves far too many people vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace and other areas of daily life.""The Equality Act will protect individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in all areas of society, including the workplace, schools, housing, access to credit, and public accommodations,"continued Rep. Pocan. "Every American has the right to equal protection under the law, regardless of who they love, or where they live."

The Equality Act, which Rep. Pocan helped introduce during a press conference earlier today, will amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation is sponsored by Congressman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) in the House and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) in the Senate, and would apply to public accommodations, federal funding, education, employment, housing, credit, and jury service.==

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) along with U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) today introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act, legislation that will help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned."As our nation continues to make great strides toward full equality, we must also do everything possible to rectify the effects of past discriminatory policies,"said Representative Pocan. "Our veterans risked their lives for our country, and it is crucial that those discharged from the armed forces due to their sexual orientation receive the recognition and benefits they deserve. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act streamlines this process, ensuring their service is respected and valued in the eyes of our country.""I am proud to re-introduce the Restore Honor to Service Members Act together with Senator Schatz and Congressman Pocan,"said Representative Rangel. "As a Korean War veteran, I understand how much this recognition means for our Service Members who faced discrimination. It is about time we pay proper tribute to the veterans who deserve to be honored for their valiant service to our country. Seeking redress for them is not only the right thing to do but also will correct historical injustice.""From the repeal of ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell' to the Supreme Court's historic ruling on marriage equality, we have made great strides in the fight to end discrimination. But there is still more work to be done to protect and promote full equality and ensure we help right our past wrongs,"said Senator Schatz. "Today, thousands of brave men and women who served our country are still denied the benefits and honorable service record they deserve. It's long past time we honor our commitment to all our service members and finally restore the dignity of gay and lesbian veterans who were unjustly discharged from our military.""The Restore Honor to Service Members Act will help streamline the process for veterans to clear their records of discriminatory discharges,"said Senator Gillibrand. "Veterans who honorably serve our nation should not be defending themselves against unwarranted punishment based solely on sexual orientation. Our service members deserve to receive the recognition they earned for their sacrifice and courage."

Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of "other than honorable," "general discharge" or "dishonorable," depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.

The legislation is supported by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, VoteVets.org, OutServe-SLDN, the Human Rights Campaign, American Veterans for Equal Rights, Lambda Legal, Swords to Plowshares, the American Bar Association, Universal Unitarian Association, and the American Humanist Association.

In addition to Representatives Pocan and Rangel, The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has97 cosponsorsand has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The bill is also cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai'i), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).###==

Content:
Washington, D.C - Yesterday, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) made publica letterfrom U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in which Ambassador Froman eased Republicans' concerns that efforts to combat global climate change would not be included in the TPP. This runs counter to previous statements made by the USTR to Congressional Democrats and environmental groups. Rep. Pocan is calling on USTR Froman to clarify whether the agreement includes provision requiring certain standards.

Concerns regarding Rep. Sensenbrenner's letter coincide with the passage of an amendment offered by Reps. Paul Ryan (WI-01) and Sensenbrenner. The amendment ensures trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. law or obligate the U.S. with respect to climate change."With critical votes before the House, members and the public need to know which is it – will the U.S. engage in trade agreements that address international climate change or not? You can't talk out of both sides of your mouth for this long and expect to not confuse everyone,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "If climate change will not even be mentioned in the TPP trade deal, I urge Trade Rep. Froman to come out and say so. Hiding behind the secrecy of the TPP while we are debating to give the Administration ‘fast track' authority on this deal is wrong."

Rep. Pocan will send a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman asking for clarification about whether the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will promote international climate change standards.###==

You can find a video clip of the remarkshere."I grew up in an auto town where almost everyone had a family member who worked in the industry. But today there are no cars made there anymore. To me, trade deals should be about whether or not we'll fight for American jobs and American worker's wages. Bad trade deals cost us both."Unless we have a say, unless the American people have a say, this trade deal will do exactly the same and cost us more jobs."I've read the text and I know where we're at with it as of now. I would like to see a deal that has better, real protective teeth for labor and environmental law, strong protections for American sovereignty and better protections for food safety and more."Bottom line, I want a trade deal that protects American jobs and lifts our wages right here at home. If we vote for TPA, we will have no ability to make it better. For this trade deal, or any other trade deal in the next six years under any president, if we want the American people to have a voice, a real voice, we must retain our authority to impact trade deals and vote against TPA. and all votes that affect it today."###==
Title: Democrats Call on Administration to Release Confidential Labor Advisory Committee Report

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C – Today, 15 House Democrats led by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) sent aletterto U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman urging the public release of the Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) report pertaining to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The Labor Advisory Committee is an official body tasked with advising the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on labor provisions in trade negotiations.

Last fall, LAC memberscompiled a reportoutlining specific criticisms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership text and detailing how their recommendations were not included in the agreement. Until recently, the document was inaccessible to Members of Congress; the general public and most Congressional staff still do not have access to the full report. Unfortunately, the USTR has classified key parts of thereport.

As Congress considers granting fast-track authority for this trade agreement, it is imperative the public has access to the entirety of the information in the LAC interim report. The consideration of any trade deal, and especially one as far-reaching as the TPP, requires a transparent discussion about the strength of labor standards and their impact on workers.

Full text of the letter is below.

Dear Ambassador Froman:

We write to urge you to publicly release several documents from the Labor Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy (LAC), dealing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), including any documents received from the LAC or any its members dated April 13, 2015 (whether in modified or unmodified form), any correspondence from LAC members dated September 3, 2014, and any related annexes.

While Congress considers Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), the TPP agreement being negotiated is the largest free trade agreement in history, covering 40 percent of world GDP. With the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being simultaneously negotiated, that total rises to 60 percent. That makes it all the more important that trade agreements be done right. With such huge implications for the TPP, we feel it is necessary for both Congress and the public to have the opportunity to adequately review concerns and issues raised in the LAC documents. This will help better inform us as we consider TPA and its application to TPP.

While we understand these materials may be made available to Members of Congress, they would not be available to staff without security clearance, and even those staff would further be restricted from viewing it if not in the presence of their Member. In many instances in the House of Representatives, Members rely on the expert advice of their designated trade staff—who more often than not do not have that clearance. This significantly hampers the ability of Members of Congress to properly and thoroughly analyze important trade documents.

We understand that multilateral negotiations must at times maintain a balance, but also believe the advice provided by the LAC in the requested documents would offer us important insights as to how TPP could affect millions of middle class Americans.

Failure to make this information available publicly prior to a vote on TPA, as was done in the Senate, despite 21 senators requesting it, would interfere with Congress's ability to properly exercise its obligations to oversee foreign commerce.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Title: Rules Committee Rejects Pocan Amendment to Protect U.S. Sovereignty
Date: June 11, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the House Rules Committee rejected his amendment, which would have prevented "Fast Track" authority from being used to pass trade deals which include Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). ISDS provisions give foreign corporations a special right to sue a government when a law they deem could affect their business, such as protecting the environment or public health, hurts a firm's current or expected profits."Across party lines, people have a problem with America giving up their sovereignty and I am disappointed the Rules Committee has rejected my amendment aimed at safeguarding our sovereignty and rule of law."ISDS provisions allow multinational corporations to put investor protections and corporate profits ahead of the health and safety of the American people. Multinational corporations have gone to great lengths to ensure special ISDS provisions are included in the TPP because these rules are weighted so favorably towards them no matter what consumer or environmental protection stands in their way."Ultimately ISDS provisions are just another reason why giving unilateral ‘Fast Track' authority, which would apply to any trade deal for the next 6 years, is such a bad idea. It's time we give up the failed trade policies of the past and adopt a new 21st century trade framework which will grow American jobs and protect U.S. consumers."

United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) introduced the same amendment in the Senate version of the "Fast Track" authority bill. In February, Rep. Pocan also introducedH.R. 967:Protecting America's Sovereignty Act, legislation to prohibit investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions in foreign trade agreements.###==
Title: Bipartisan Group Urges Education Department to Simplify Financial Aid Process
Date: June 4, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA), along with U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), led a bipartisan group of 53 Members of Congress in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan urging him to use his authority to allow the use of data from the second preceding tax year, also known as "prior-prior year" data when students are filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in applying to college or university. Currently, many students across the country are receiving their college admissions letters without the accompanying financial aid award information they need to compare college options and costs."Earlier and more accurate financial aid award information would allow students and families, and especially low-income and first generation students, to make better-informed decisions about their educational careers,"the Members of Congress wrote."Unfortunately, the current limitation on the tax data students and families can use on the FAFSA has created a highly disjointed process and timeline. The complexity of the financial aid application process also undermines educational aspirations, enrollment, and persistence. Resolving this situation will be an important priority for our work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. However, we do not need to wait to provide students and families much-needed relief. The Department can and should improve the process of filling out the FAFSA right now."

Most families' incomes do not change significantly from year-to-year, yet the current process forces applicants to wait until January 1 of each year—far after many college application deadlines—to complete the FAFSA in the same year they plan to enroll using the prior year's tax data. When the FAFSA becomes available, many students and their families struggle to obtain tax documents quickly enough for dozens of local, state and private grant deadlines. The short window provided for filing taxes before filling out the FAFSA places students and families in a difficult situation with few good options.

Under their authority, the Department can allow students to use prior-prior year data, which is more likely to be on file and much easier to import directly into the FAFSA. This will speed up the application process and help reduce the burden of verification for documenting their financial situation and aid eligibility. Prior-prior year data is also not likely to have a significant effect on students' financial aid awards. Financial aid administrators, admissions officers, state grant agencies, and college access programs also strongly support using this data.

Title: Pocan, Messer Introduce Resolution in Support of the Perkins Loan Program
Date: June 3, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON,D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Luke Messer (IN-06), members of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced a resolution in support of the Perkins Loan Program.

The Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest loan which helps undergraduate and graduate students with demonstrated financial need meet the costs of higher education. The University of Wisconsin System awarded $28.8 million dollars in loans to 15,829 students during the '13-'14 school year.During the same timeframe, the Indiana University System awarded $9.3 million in loans to more than 5,300 students.

The Perkins Loan program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2015 if Congress does not act to reauthorize this program. If the Perkins Loan is eliminated, students in Wisconsin, Indiana, and across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid."The Perkins Loan Program is an important tool to help make college more affordable for all,"said Rep. Pocan."Perkins Loans have helped millions of students struggling to find a way to pay for college, in Wisconsin and across the country. Perkins Loans are an essential aspect of ensuring college is both accessible and affordable for all students. I am proud to introduce this resolution with Rep. Messer to show bipartisan support for preserving the Perkins Loan Program.""Millions of American students have benefited from Federal student financial aid,"said Congressman Messer."I understand that because I'm one of them. I appreciate the opportunity to work with Rep. Pocan on this important issue. I am committed to ensuring programs like Perkins are around for years to come so that the cost of a college degree doesn't prevent someone from pursuing their dream of earning one.""In 2013-14 over $10 million of Federal Perkins Loan was a critical source of educational funds for 4580 low income students with demonstrated need at UW-Madison alone,"said Susan Fischer, Director of Financial Aid at UW-Madison."Without extension of this currently self-sustaining and proven loan program, these same students will be faced with the possible choice of ceasing their educational goals or borrowing funds at very high interest rates from private sources. Since the Perkins Loan's inception at UW-Madison, every dollar borrowed has been recycled 7 times; a remarkable exercise in efficiency and effectiveness.""Without the Perkins Loan, I honestly do not know how I am going to pay for school this upcoming year,"said IU student Zac Acker."This is going to allow me to successfully pursue my dreams and move forward in being an Indiana University alum,"said IU student Adrian D. Wynn.###==

Title: Pocan Statement on WTO Ordered Rollback of Popular U.S. Consumer Protection Law
Date: May 18, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C - U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) issued the following statement on today¹s final ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) against a popular U.S. country-of-origin meat labeling (COOL) policy, which requires labeling of pork and beef sold in the United States to inform consumers the country in which the animals were born, raised and slaughtered:"Today's ruling is a clear example of how bad trade agreements hurt America's sovereignty and weaken consumer and environmental policies enacted to protect our health and well-being. From the roll back of U.S. Clean Air Act regulations to altered auto fuel efficiency standards and even possible changes to our financial regulations, bad trade deals negotiated in secret have consistently shown why it is important to get trade agreements done right, not fast."With the Trans-Pacific Partnership encompassing more than 40 percent of the world¹s economy we have to get it right and ensure we do not put the health and safety of the American people at risk. Congress should not grant fast track authority and rubber stamp the largest trade deal since NAFTA, when we don¹t know enough about the TPP and its potential consequences on our communities."

The COOL policy was created when Congress enacted mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat in the 2008 farm bill and was signed in to law by President George W. Bush. Today's ruling is not subject to further appeal.###==
Title: Pocan, Messer Help Americans Better Plan for Retirement
Date: May 14, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON,D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Luke Messer (IN-06) today introduced legislation to help working Americans better plan for retirement.

For most members of the workforce, a combination of Social Security and 401(k) savings or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) will provide them with monthly income when they retire. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of American workers have never calculated how much money they will need to save to live comfortably in retirement.

The Lifetime Income Disclosure Act (H.R. 2317), introduced by Messer and Pocan would help change that. Under the bill, certain retirement plans, like 401(k)s would be required to include what's called an "annuity equivalent" on a participant's statement. That means, on each statement, a person's current retirement balance will be illustrated as if they were receiving a monthly paycheck for life."This is a small but important step when it comes to helping American workers plan for retirement," said Messer. "Showing someone the value of their retirement account balance as a monthly income payment will give them a better of idea of how much they are saving and whether or not it's enough to enjoy a comfortable standard of living after leaving the workforce."

Said Congressman Pocan of the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act, "Seeing how retirement savings translate into an expected monthly payment is a powerful way for workers to see their retirement security grow and drives home the importance of saving early and often. The Social Security Administration already discloses benefits in terms of monthly income. This bill creates a similar straightforward tool to help workers with employer sponsored retirement plans determine if they are on track to meeting their retirement goals."

A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that workers who saw their savings illustrated as monthly income were better informed about retirement planning, were more likely to know how much to save and had higher confidence in their expected retirement income.

This week, Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) introduced companion legislation in the Senate (S. 1317).

Original cosponsors of the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act include Congressmen Jared Polis (CO-02), Dave Reichert (WS-08) and Ron Kind (WI-03)

Supporters of bill include: American Council of Life Insurers, American Retirement Association, Insured Retirement Institute, MassMutual, Pension Rights Center, Prudential, TIAA-CREF and Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) today issued the following statement on the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the NSA's warrantless collection of phone call records of millions of Americans is illegal:"Today's ruling confirms what we've known from the beginning – the NSA's actions have broken the law and invaded the privacy of millions of Americans. It is long past time for Congress to make clear that such programs do not have a place in our democracy. We can be a nation with the strongest national security while also respecting the privacy and civil liberties of our citizens."If we are to preserve our right to privacy in the digital age, we must go further than what is in the current draft of the USA Freedom Act and repeal the entire PATRIOT Act. This is the best way to fully protect Americans from another invasion of privacy by our government."

Background

Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) this year introduced the Surveillance State Repeal Act,H.R. 1466, which offers a complete repeal of the 2001 PATRIOT Act, which the NSA has cited as the legal basis for its phone metadata harvesting surveillance program.

Additionally, the bill repeals the FISA Amendments Act, which contains provisions for email data harvesting, while overhauling the NSA's domestic surveillance program. Additionally, the legislation makes retaliation against federal national security whistleblowers illegal and ensures any FISA collection against a US Person takes place only pursuant to a valid warrant based on probable cause.==

Title: On Earth Day Pocan and Schakowsky Introduce Strongest Federal Fracking Ban in the U.S.

Washington, D.C.—On Earth Day, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), members of the Safe Climate Caucus, introduced theProtect Our Public Lands Act, H.R. 1902. The legislation is the strongest anti-fracking bill introduced in Congress to date and would ban fracking on public lands."Our national parks, forests and public lands are some of our most treasured places and need to be protected for future generations,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "It is clear fracking has a detrimental impact on the environment and there are serious safety concerns associated with these type of wells. Until we fully understand the effects, the only way to avoid these risks is to halt fracking entirely. We should not allow short-term economic gain to harm our public lands, damage our communities or endanger workers."

"Today is Earth Day – a time to renew our commitment to protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the planet we all call home,"said Rep. Jan Schakowsky. ‘Our public lands have been preserved and protected by the federal government for over one hundred years. We owe it to future generations to maintain their natural beauty and rich biodiversity. I believe the only way to do that is to enact the Protect Our Public Lands Act, and I will continue to fight to see that happen.""Our public lands are a shared national heritage, and shouldn't be polluted, destroyed, and fracked to enrich the oil and gas industry," saidWenonah Hauter, Executive Director of Food & Water Watch. "Ironically, the President is speaking in the Everglades today, a unique and fragile ecosystem that is threatened by nearby fracking on public land. Congress must follow Congressman Pocan and Congresswoman Schakowsky's bold leadership and ban fracking on these lands, so that future generations can enjoy these special places."

Mounting evidenceshows that fracking threatens our air, water and public health. To make matters worse, reports have shown that existing fracking wells on public lands aren't being adequately inspected, creating even more potential for disastrous accidents. Right now, about 90 percent of federally managed lands are available for oil and gas leasing, while only 10 percent are reserved for conservation, recreation, wildlife and cultural heritage.

TheProtect our Public Lands Act,H.R. 1902prohibits fracking, the use of fracking fluid, and acidization for the extraction of oil and gas on public lands for any lease issued, renewed, or readjusted. The legislation is endorsed by the Food and Water Watch, the American Sustainable Business Council, Environment America, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Progressive Democrats of America.###==

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today called on Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to withdraw from his planned June appearance at the Western Conservatives Summit in Denver, CO after event organizers uninvited an LGBT Republican group:"Governor Walker should not validate the decision by event organizers to discriminate against an LGBT Republican group by attending the Western Conservative Summit. After the fallout of this type of discrimination in Indiana, Governor Walker must send the clear message that Wisconsin does not tolerate discrimination of LGBT individuals and groups."This message is even more necessary after every Republican in the State Assembly rejected Rep. Andy Jorgensen's resolution to prohibit Indiana-style so-called ‘religious freedom' laws in Wisconsin. We should all stand up against the recent trend among some states to promote discrimination in the name of politics or so-called religious freedom."We have seen the economic impact of discrimination on Indiana's economy after tourism dropped and companies threated to leave the state. Governor Walker must ensure Wisconsin's already fragile economy is not further damaged by his actions."###==
Title: Pocan Opposes Fast-Track Trade Promotion Authority Plan
Date: April 16, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today issued the following statement on the Trade Promotion Authority proposal introduced by U.S. Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI):"This Trade Promotion Authority Bill repeats the trade mistakes of the past and fails to provide critical protections for American workers, the environment, and our overall economy."The Hatch-Wyden proposal puts the paychecks of hardworking Americans on the line. Over the last three decades, in large part because of bad trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA, Americans have worked harder than ever for less. In fact, hundreds of thousands of jobs – factory jobs, middle-class jobs – in states across the country were lost. Anyone who does not see the connection between our economy and the failed trade agreements of the past will remain on the wrong side of the future. We cannot let history repeat itself by pushing a Trade Promotion Authority bill which paves the road for an agreement which undermines American sovereignty and puts our workers' wages and jobs at risk."If passed, Fast-Track would ram through trade agreements, negotiated in secret, through Congress without giving Members of Congress sufficient time to debate and limits Congress' ability to make amendments. Essentially, this Fast-Track proposal provides carte blanche to the President and the U.S. Trade Representative on trade matters, while tying Congress' hands."With still too many questions left unanswered and a history of broken trade promises, Congress should not give away its constitutional authority to the President – regardless of party. I urge my colleagues to oppose this trade promotion legislation because it does not do enough to protect American workers, our environment, and our economy."###==
Title: Pocan and Ellison Call on Congress to Pass Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment
Date: April 9, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Greg Jones, President of the NAACP of Dane County, today called on Congress to passH.J.Res.25which would amend the U.S. Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to vote. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and guarantee this fundamental right.

While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution in fact contains no expressed guarantee of an individual's right to vote, a point confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision inBush v. Gore. Only a constitutional amendment can ensure this right will be guaranteed in the future."Most Americans consider voting a basic right, but some states are chipping away at voting rights and making it harder for citizens to cast their ballots,"said Rep. Mark Pocan. "This amendment would prevent states from creating obstacles for Americans to participate in our democracy. Citizens get to choose their representatives. Elected officials should not be able to choose their voters. As the world's leading democracy, we must guarantee the right to vote for all.""Our democracy gains strength when more Americans participate in elections,"Rep. Keith Ellison said."But millions cannot vote today because of restrictive voting laws in some states. A constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote would help stop this voter suppression. In 2015, we should make voting as easy as possible. Nothing should stand between Americans and the voting booth.""Ensuring equal representation at the polls helps to make certain that our communities also have sustainable jobs, environmental justice, criminal justice, equitable education, and voting rights,"said Greg Jones, President of the NAACP of Dane County."In Wisconsin we face challenges that impact this fundamental right. The Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment would go a long way to ensuring civil and human rights in our Democracy, and the NAACP stands ready to carry the struggle for equality and justice throughout the election process."

While the right to vote is essential to our democracy, according to theBrennan Center for Justice, at least 83 restrictive bills were introduced in 29 states whose legislatures have had floor activity in 2014, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.

The text of the amendment is below:

SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.

SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.###==

Washington, D.C.—Today, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced the Surveillance State Repeal Act. The legislation would repeal dragnet federal surveillance laws, while overhauling the NSA's domestic surveillance program."The warrantless collection of millions of personal communications from innocent Americans is a direct violation of our constitutional right to privacy,"said Rep. Pocan. "Revelations about the NSA's programs reveal the extraordinary extent to which the program has invaded Americans' privacy. I reject the notion that we must sacrifice liberty for security- we can live in a secure nation which also upholds a strong commitment to civil liberties. This legislation ends the NSA's dragnet surveillance practices, while putting provisions in place to protect the privacy of American citizens through real and lasting change.""The Patriot Act contains many provisions that violate the Fourth Amendment and have led to a dramatic expansion of our domestic surveillance state,"said Rep. Massie."Our Founding Fathers fought and died to stop the kind of warrantless spying and searches that the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act authorize. It is long past time to repeal the Patriot Act and reassert the constitutional rights of all Americans. I am proud to co-sponsor Congressman Pocan's bill and look forward to working with him on this issue."

This law will prevent Wisconsinites from participating fully in our democracy and will unfairly burden disadvantaged and minority voters in future elections. Clearly, Gov. Scott Walker and Republicans in the state legislature want to choose their voters instead allowing voters to choose them."Wisconsin voter ID law is yet another setback in what has been constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. Today's action by the Supreme Court is yet another indication our country is in desperate need of a constitutionally guaranteed right to vote for all of its citizens."

In January, Pocan introducedlegislationwith U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (MN-05) to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. The Pocan Ellison Voting Rights Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and empower the government with the authority to protect this fundamental right.###==

Washington, D.C—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on the passing of former Wisconsin Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier:"Bob Kastenmeier will always be one of Wisconsin's greatest legislators. Bob leaves behind a long legacy as a champion for the people of Wisconsin and the United States. He was a leading voice for civil rights and civil liberties, and an advocate for peace in his 32-years as a U.S. Representative and decades after."I got my start in national politics knocking on doors for Bob's campaigns while in college. I'll always remember how much his constituents loved and admired him. Today, as an heir to Bob's legacy, I work every day to live up to his standard and to follow his model as a legislator."As we remember Bob's life and his service to our country, our thoughts are with his wife, Dorothy."###==
Title: Pocan: Republican Budget Makes You Work Harder For Less

PR Tag: Press Release

Washington, D.C—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today issued the following statement on theRepublican Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Resolution:"Budgets show our priorities, and what is clear is House Republicans want hard-working Americans to work harder for less. Since the financial crisis, real wages for American workers have barely grown at all. This budget does nothing to help working families get ahead or improve employment opportunities and paychecks. Instead, it is chock-full of tax giveaways to the wealthy and expands a tax code already tilted to benefit the top 1 percent. Our country deserves a budget which benefits every American, not just the wealthy few."This budget proposal makes it harder for middle-class families to pay for college and does not provide a single penny to address the $1.2 trillion student loan debt crisis. Republican cuts to education are essentially ensuring the future belongs to the privileged few by greasing the ladders of opportunity for children from middle-class families and making a college education less affordable. Repeated cuts to education will hurt our nation's economy over the long-term and our ability to compete in the global economy."Under the Republican plan, the promise of a secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work will be a thing of the past. Their plan once again ends the Medicare guarantee and makes deep cuts to the safety net for America's seniors. Seniors on Medicare will have to pay more for preventive health services and prescription drugs, in essence a tax hike on those who can afford it the least."These are not my values or the values of my constituents in South Central Wisconsin. I understand tough choices need to be made when coming up with a budget. But balancing budgets on the backs of seniors, students, and working families is a reckless and irresponsible choice. Congress should work together to develop a budget for the American people which creates good-paying jobs and expands economic opportunity for all."###==
Title: Rep. Pocan, Sens. Murray and Baldwin Introduce Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to Combat Bullying and Harassment at Colleges and Universities
Date: March 18, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI), along with U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), reintroduced legislation aimed at reducing dangerous bullying and harassment that affects one in five students at colleges and universities across the country.The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2015requires institutions of higher education to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The bill also establishes a grant program to support campus anti-harassment activities and programs. The legislation is named after Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University who took his own life after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over the Internet."Bullying is a real and persistent danger for far too many students at our colleges and universities and too many of these students are targeted for their sexual orientation,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."This bill ensures no student has to suffer the humiliation of being harassed for who they are, or who they love. Institutions of higher learning should be a place of open expression, which celebrate diversity and embrace students from all different backgrounds.""All students deserve the chance to further their education, without the fear of harassment and bullying,"Senator Murray said."LGBT students are more likely to be harassed in school, yet there is no federal requirement for colleges and universities to protect their students from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. I am proud that this bill would take meaningful steps to provide schools and students with tools to prevent harassment and protect survivors. By honoring Tyler's life with this legislation, we can work to prevent the bullying that far too many students are forced to endure.""No student should have to live in fear of being who they are. Our schools should not be, and cannot be a place of discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation or violence. This legislation is an important step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to succeed in safe and healthy communities of learning and achievement,"said Senator Baldwin."Everyone deserves a fair shot at our colleges and universities across America and this legislation will help ensure people can pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.""Schools need to take bullying, harassment and humiliation seriously, by making it official policy. We support this legislation because no other student should have to feel the pain and humiliation that Tyler felt after he had been web-camed by his roommate. Every student deserves to be protected and supported so they can focus on the reason they are in school.....to learn,"said Jane Clementi, Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation and Tyler's mother.

The legislation has received support from advocates and organizations including: Human Rights Campaign, The Anti-Defamation League, the National Women's Law Center, the American Association for University Women, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the National LGBTQ Task Force Action, and Pride Foundation."All students deserve to learn in environments free from harassment,"said David Stacy, Human Rights Campaign Government Affairs Director."We applaud Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan for their unwavering leadership and commitment to passing protections that will help save lives and promote fairness and equality at colleges and universities across the country.""Working to create safe, inclusive schools and communities is a top priority for the Anti-Defamation League. Cyberbullying is on the rise, as an increasing number of youth are misusing Internet and cell phone technology to bully, harass, and even incite violence against others. Colleges need to be given the tools and training necessary to combat this harassment and create safe communities for students. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is an important step forward towards that goal and we will be working to support its enactment." –Hilary G. Bernstein, Regional Director, Pacific Northwest, Anti-Defamation League

"This bill is an important step forward in combatting harassment on college campuses. A federal requirement that institutions of higher education have comprehensive anti-harassment policies is long overdue, and a grant program to support prevention and training programs and student services is much needed."– Fatima Goss Graves, Vice President for Education & Employment at the National Women's Law Center

"GLSEN thanks Sens. Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Mark Pocan for reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act and for their ongoing commitment to ensuring that all college students have access to safe and welcoming campuses,"said Dr. Eliza Byard, GLSEN's Executive Director."LGBT college students, like all members of the higher education community, have the right to feel safe and supported as they navigate their way through their education. We look forward to working with members of Congress in the coming months to make these policy ideas a reality.""Not a single student should ever live in fear of being harassed or physically assaulted while trying to get an education. As lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, we know all too well what it means to be targeted, to be discriminated against, and to lack basic protections. And while LGBTQ youth—particularly LGBTQ youth of color—face higher rates of harassment and discrimination at school, bullying is an epidemic that affects us all as a nation. Everyone has a part to play in ending bullying. From the classroom to the corridors of power—we ask everyone to join us in creating a welcoming and safe educational experience for every student in America,"said Rea Carey, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund Executive Director."As Tyler Clementi's story shows us, people's lives are at stake if we do not find ways to adapt schools and their policies to support LGBTQ students in being their full selves,"said Kris Hermanns, Executive Director of Pride Foundation."This bill demonstrates that LGBTQ students matter, while also providing teachers and administrators the necessary support to intervene and protect students from harassment and cyberbullying. On behalf of our community, I would like to thank Senator Murray for being a champion on this issue and for working to ensure that school is a welcoming and safe place for all."

Madison, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) this morning stood with Wisconsin's working families andregistered his oppositionto the damaging so-called Right-to-Work law in the State Assembly."This morning I went to the Wisconsin State Assembly to register my opposition to the Republican union busting bill," said Rep. Mark Pocan. "Sadly, Republicans in the legislature are moving forward with this divisive bill to help advance Gov. Scott Walker's national agenda. But for Gov. Walker and the Republicans, the real story is a failing Wisconsin economy, lagging behind most of the country in jobs and wage growth, and this bill will only make things worse. ""Let's be clear, this bill has nothing to do with helping Wisconsin businesses or attracting more jobs to the state," continued Rep. Pocan. "It's unfortunate that Wisconsin's working men and women have become the pawns in Gov. Walker's political games. We have seen these so-called Right-to-Work laws drive down wages and cut benefits for workers in other states. Hard-working Wisconsinites, regardless of political party or union membership, will have to endure the consequences of this Republican bill.==

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on the Wisconsin congressional delegation to refrain from politicizing the field hearing on the Tomah VA Medical Center after Rep. Sean Duffy's appearance on Fox News."Our veterans deserve an objective and thorough investigation into the prescription practices at Tomah VA. While we are all extremely troubled about the tragic situation at the Tomah facility, it is not helpful to turn this tragedy into a partisan, political witch hunt. I believe Rep. Duffy's comments on Fox News have, unfortunately, raised concerns about his lack of objectivity in this matter. Politicizing Tomah will only damage the integrity of the investigation and make it harder to get to the bottom of the issue."It needs to be made perfectly clear – this is an investigation into practices at Tomah VA. The focus should remain on fixing the problems at the VA Medical Center in Tomah and ensuring our veterans receive the care they deserve, not scoring cheap political points. I look forward to attending the House Veterans Affairs Committee field hearing and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get the objective facts in the ongoing investigation so we can address the problems at Tomah VA for Wisconsin veterans."###==

Title: Circle of Friends for American Veterans: Pocan a Champion for Veterans; Affirms National Veterans' Bill of Rights

Falls Church, Virginia –The nationwide Circle of Friends for American Veterans (COFAV) recognized Congressman Mark Pocan today for his affirmation of its Veterans' Bill of Rights. Congressman Pocan readily affirmed the Veterans' Bill of Rights (VBOR) and plans to emphasize it in his work in the House of Representatives. He has affirmed through the VBOR that

1) Veterans are a top priority; 2) He supports reducing the wait time on disability claims from the current 202 day average to 125; 3) The VA should negotiate for its procurement services; and 4) The VA should collect all possible insurance claims owed it."We must take a holistic approach to the treatment of those men and women who take on the extraordinary responsibility of defending our nation."Said Rep. Mark Pocan, "Paying for our veterans' health care needs is part of the cost of war and we must fully fund efforts to provide veterans with the support they have earned defending our nation. I am extremely grateful to the servicemen and women who have dedicated their lives and made countless sacrifices to protect our country."

The challenges facing our country's nearly 22 million veterans are many. There are almost 100,000 homeless veterans, nearly 700,000 cases of PTSD & TBI, and 22 veteran suicides each day. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association one half of all veterans returning from a war zone suffer from chronic pain.

The VA can gain literally billions of dollars in new revenue to provide services, without a dollar in new costs for taxpayers, by merely filling out the required paperwork on procurement and insurance claims. The services that can be expanded at zero cost include housing for 20,000 homeless veterans, and new dental procedures for over 300,000 veterans.

Congressman Mark Pocan is committed to ensuring that veterans get the benefits they have earned. Since Congress first convened in January, he has introduced legislation focused on solving the issues veterans face, including the Putting our Veterans Back to Work Act of 2015 and the Veterans Access to Hearing Health Act of 2015. Congressman Pocan has proven that as a Representative for Wisconsin's Second District he is ready and willing to stand up for America's Veterans.

Since 1993, The Circle of Friends for American Veterans has harnessed the power of the media to rally public support on behalf of American Veterans. COFAV has sponsored 196 programs and forums, with well over 100 Members of Congress speaking at its events. The Circle of Friends for American Veterans has supported local homeless veteran transitional facilities by organizing and conducting programs for public support in their local areas, as well as through earned media.###==

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today strongly criticizedthe decision by Wisconsin's Republican state legislative leadersto call lawmakers into an extraordinary session to fast track so-called right-to-work legislation."I am very disappointed to hear Republicans are pursuing right-to-work in Wisconsin – continuing to lead our state in the wrong direction. If Republicans think the public will support this legislation they would not be trying to rush this across the finish line. But the cowardly decision by Republican leaders to ram this harmful legislation through without time for public comment only shows their complete disregard for the legislative process and the voices of Wisconsinites. Instead of moving Wisconsin ‘FORWARD', misguided Republicans are leading the state backwards."As we have seen in other states, right-to-work reduces wages and salaries for workers, cuts benefits such as health insurance and a pension, and eliminates workplace protections. And today, Wisconsin Republicans are doubling down on their failed economic experiment. Wisconsin has lagged behind our Midwest neighbors in job creation and economic growth, and the paychecks of hard working Wisconsinite's are growing at the slowest rate in the region since Governor Scott Walker and Republicans took control of the state. When will enough be enough?"

Title: Democrats Introduce Legislation to Ban Investor-State Provisions in Trade Agreements
Date: February 19, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and 12 House Democrats today introduced H.R. 967:Protecting America's Sovereignty Act, legislation to prohibit investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions in foreign trade agreements. TheProtecting America's Sovereignty Actwas introduced with the following original House co-sponsors: Reps. John Conyers (D-MI), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Gene Green (D-TX), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Keith Ellison (D-MN), Rick Nolan (D-MN), and Paul Tonko (D-NY).

Full bill text is availablehere.

This legislation will prevent the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions in any trade agreement between the U.S. and a foreign country. ISDS rules give foreign corporations a special right to sue a government when a law they deem could affect their business, such as protecting the environment or public health, hurts a firm's current or expected profits. Under ISDS rules, corporations may seek compensation from a secretive tribunal of corporate international trade lawyers which put investor protections and corporate profits ahead of consumer rights and job protections and outside the U.S. court system."ISDS provisions could weaken U.S. health, safety, and environmental protections if they continue to be part of future trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"said Rep. Pocan."We cannot allow multinational corporations to continue prioritizing their profits over the health, well-being, and sovereignty of our communities. It's time we give up the failed trade policies of the past and adopt a new 21stcentury trade framework which will grow American jobs and protect U.S. consumers.""Americans have seen what happens when corporations use ISDS provisions in other foreign trade agreements,"Rep. Pocan continued."For the past half century, corporations have used ISDS provisions in international trade agreements to boost profits at the expense of local communities. Instead of including protections for multinational corporations, our trade agreements must provide consumer and job protections for Americans. If we do not learn from history, we are doomed to make the same mistakes."

One of the most egregious examples of investor-state dispute resolution occurred after Australia implemented a plain packaging law for cigarette cartons, designed to reduce the rate of smoking and improve the health of its citizens. Philip Morris Asia Limited – the Asian arm of the giant U.S. tobacco producer - challenged the law before the international Permanent Court of Arbitration, citing an ISDS provision in a 1993 investment treaty with Hong Kong. The corporation claimed the law violated this agreement, depriving Philip Morris of the full value of its investments and impairing their profitability. Philip Morris is seeking billions of dollars from the Australian government for compensation.

In 2014, Rep. Pocan launched the#TruthInTrade campaignwhich highlighted a number of cases where ISDS provisions in foreign trade agreements have weakened food, environmental, and health safety regulations.###==
Title: LGBT Members of Congress Raise Concerns About Including of Brunei and Malaysia in TPP Negotiations

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), David Cicilline (D-RI), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Mark Takano (D-CA), Co-Chairs of theCongressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today sent a letter to President Barack Obama asking for clarification on the inclusion of Brunei and Malaysia in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.

Last year, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced action to revoke the Republic of The Gambia's trade preferences previously enjoyed under the African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA), after Gambia implemented a law criminalizing homosexuality, targeting individuals perceived to be LGBT with harassment, detention, and life in prison.

The lawmakers said in the letter: "In light of the decision to end trade preferences for Gambia, we write today to ask for clarification on the inclusion of Brunei and Malaysia in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. These two countries are responsible for severe human rights abuses, including adopting penal codes permitting the imprisonment and physical harm of LGBT people. It seems inconsistent for the United States to expand trade privileges to [Brunei and Malaysia] while taking action against Gambia."

In June 2014, a broad coalition of groupscalled on the United Statesto stop trade negotiations until Brunei revokes its inhumane criminal code.

Full text of the letter is available below and onlinehere.

President Barack H. Obama

The White House

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear President Obama:

As members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community we support your Administration's focus on LGBT rights and efforts to help end persecution in countries across the globe. Your commitment to equality is unrivaled by previous administrations and we have been proud to work with you to make progress on these issues. We stand strongly behind the Administration policy articulated by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011, stating, "The Obama Administration defends the human rights of LGBT people as part of our comprehensive human rights policy and as a priority of our foreign policy," and Secretary of State John Kerry's declaration in 2014 that "LGBT rights are human rights, and human rights are LGBT rights."

Last year, the Republic of The Gambia implemented a law criminalizing homosexuality, targeting individuals perceived to be LGBT with harassment, detention, and life in prison. Shortly after implementation of the law, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced action to revoke Gambia's trade preferences previously enjoyed under theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000(AGOA). According to the USTR, the decision was made in part due to the enactment of the anti-gay law.

In light of the decision to end trade preferences for Gambia, we write today to ask for clarification on the inclusion of Brunei and Malaysia in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. These two countries are responsible for severe human rights abuses, including adopting penal codes permitting the imprisonment and physical harm of LGBT people. It seems inconsistent for the United States to expand trade privileges to these two countries while taking action against Gambia.

Last year, 119 Representatives and 10 Senators wrote to the Administration urging action be taken to address these human rights abuses before proceeding with the TPP agreement. To our knowledge, no progress has been made on that front. Brunei continues to move forward with full implementation of a strict penal code mandating the stoning to death of LGBT citizens; similarly, Malaysia has not taken action to end its persecution of LGBT individuals. Despite these abuses, the Administration continues to include them in negotiations around the TPP and lists them as intended signatories to the trade agreement.

We urge you to bring consistency to the Administration's foreign and trade policy. The LGBT community looks to your Administration to fight for human rights across the globe and we hope you will continue this record of equality by removing Brunei and Malaysia from the TPP if they neglect to address these abuses.

Sincerely,

Title: Republicans Block Pocan and Fudge Voucher Schools Amendment to K-12 Education Bill
Date: February 11, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.—House Republicans todayblocked an amendmentby U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Marcia Fudge (D-OH) to the Republican education bill, H.R. 5. Reps. Fudge and Pocan offered an amendment that would keep public funding in public schools and restore key state education funding provisions:"Keeping public funds in public schools ensures every child across the United States can receive a high-quality education, regardless of their economic condition," said Rep. Pocan. "This bill radically rejects the notion that a high-quality public education is a commitment and a responsibility that must be sustained by both the states and the federal government. By dismantling the Title I funding formula, not only would public schools and students in low-income areas be harmed, it would also start the slide of taxpayer dollars to be used to create or expand state voucher programs. The Republican bill, H.R. 5 puts our country's education system on a slippery slope towards a nationalized voucher program and the end of public education as we know it. In Wisconsin, we have spent over $1 billion on vouchers with little accountability and even less academic achievement to show for it."

Wisconsin's voucher program is central to an emerging national debate over the privatization of public education. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and many in the Republican Party have pushed the idea of expanding voucher schools nationwide – using Wisconsin as the model – without safeguarding the needs of students with disabilities and ensuring schools meet high standards of academic achievement.

Rep. Fudge expressed displeasure with the outcome of the vote on the amendment and H.R. 5 in its current form. "I am disappointed the committee did not adopt the Fudge-Pocan amendment. Every student in America has a right to a quality education. H.R. 5 does not protect that right. The addition of Title I portability, removal of maintenance of effort requirements, and continuation of the teacher salary loophole represents a significant step backwards in meeting the educational needs of low-income children. Our amendment supported the children ESEA was intended to help, which H.R. 5 fails to do. I refuse to fail our students and their families. They deserve better."

According to a recent report released by the Center for American Progress, in her home state of Ohio portability would result in the loss of over $45 million dollars for schools above a 30 percent poverty rate, and an increase of over $27 million dollars for schools with a poverty rate of less than 15 percent.==

Courts in states across the country have ruled discrimination in any form has no place in our democratic society. The U.S. Constitution protects all civil and human rights and it is up to the courts to apply those protections equally for every citizen."It's disappointing to see Judge Moore's judicial activism block marriage equality for the people of Alabama and his blatant disregard for our legal system.

Content:
Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced legislation to allow student loan borrowers to refinance their loans. The bill,first introduced in 2013, would allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their federal student loans any time a lower interest rate is available."College graduates are drowning in loan payments and it's weighing down our economy,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."The federal government should prioritize making a college education as affordable and accessible as possible. Today, two-thirds of Americans leave college weighed down by crushing student loan debt making it harder for them to start achieving their dreams or contribute to the economy after graduation."This bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like a mortgage or car loan, bringing down the long-term cost of a college degree and increasing economic opportunities for graduates,"Rep. Pocan continued. "Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to realize this is a serious economic problem which needs to be addressed. Our economy will never reach its full potential as long as Americans are weighed down by massive student loan debt."

According to the New York Federal Reserve, total student debt has quadrupled over the past 10 years, shooting up from $240 billion at the start of 2003 to nearly $1 trillion in 2013. Acomprehensive report on student loan debtby the Institute for One Wisconsin found student loan debt has a dramatic, negative effect on Wisconsin's and the nation's economy – impacting new home and car sales. Of the more than $1.2 trillion in total student debt in this country, 83 percent is from federal student loans."Millions of American have worked hard to get an education and took on the personal responsibility to pay for it. They've earned a fair shot at the middle class, but instead they are increasingly saddled with decades of debt,"said One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross."Rep. Pocan's Student Loan Refinancing Act to let borrowers take advantage of lower interest rates is a common sense reform that will help restore fairness to a system gone awry and invigorate our economy.""Allowing students and families to refinance their student loan debt should not be a partisan issue,"said Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers. "With millions of American families saddled with exorbitantly high debt, and with interest rates at historically low levels, now is the time to provide immediate financial relief to students and their families. This bill will help hardworking Americans pay down their debt over time and will put more money in their wallets that they can use to further their dreams, invest in our communities and grow our economy. It's smart economics, and it's good public policy."###==

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a member of the House Budget Committee, today released the following statement onPresident Obama's fiscal year 2016 Budget:"President Obama's Budget reflects the country's improving economy. As our economy rebounds from the recession, so should our investments to strengthen the middle-class. The President has laid out an aggressive agenda to make critical investments in our nation's infrastructure, job training, and education. These investments will help boost the economy and raise the incomes of middle class families and those working to join the middle class."I also applaud the President for replacing the draconian sequester cuts which have squeezed investments in education and research. Now is the time to get rid of the austerity mentality some had during the recession and begin to reinvest in America's hard-working men and women. President Obama has put forward a budget representing our priorities and values – responsibly growing the economy through critical investments in infrastructure, education, and scientific research.""As the budget process continues, I hope to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress to advance policies which will build on the progress our economy has made and put our country on track for long-term fiscal success."###==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Honda and Sens. Hirono, Baldwin Champion Initiative to Expand Access to Early Education

Washington, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Mike Honda (D-CA), along with U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), today introduced theProviding Resources Early for Kids(PRE-K)Act, legislation to expand access to high-quality early learning programs for children from birth to age five. The PRE-K Act helps more kids arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed by establishing federal-state partnerships, incentivizing states to both improve the quality of state preschool programs and expand to serve more children in need."High-quality early education is essential to a student's long-term academic success,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."The PRE-K Act will encourage states to make critical investments in our nation's future and provide better preschool opportunities for children. Improving educational outcomes depends on reaching children early to ensure kids are prepared to succeed.""The Pre-K Act makes critical investments in our nation's early-education programs,"Rep. Mike Honda said."The matching grants for Pre-K programs and certification requirements for Pre-K teachers are sensible steps to improve our early education system. These steps are a key component of the Equity and Excellence Commission's recommendations for tackling the inequity problem in our schools, and I am excited to sponsor legislation that translates those recommendations into action. We need to keep working to ensure that each and every child gets an excellent education, starting as early as possible.""The investments we make in our youngest keiki are paid back in full by enhancing our nation's competitiveness in our global economy,"said Senator Hirono."Hawaii educators have told me that many kids start kindergarten already behind. Our children deserve the best chance to succeed and our educators need all the tools we can give them to put students on track to being lifelong learners. That's why, beginning when I was Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor 20 years ago, I have been committed to quality early learning to help kids start kindergarten ready to succeed. Where you live should not determine what chance you get in life, and this bill will ensure states like Hawaii can create effective, quality state preschool programs. This bill focuses on quality because it is what makes the biggest difference in educational outcomes. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate and moving this bill forward.""Throughout our history, Wisconsin has made real investments in early childhood education because we understand that a strong start helps build a strong middle class. Our nation must make it a priority to invest in early education for all, so that the doors of opportunity are open to every child and help provide them the skills they need to realize their dreams,"said Senator Baldwin."I'm proud to join this effort to renew our commitment to the proven foundation we know that early childhood education provides. This is a critical investment for our middle class and for our future."

A recentWhite House reportsummarizes what decades of research has shown: high quality early learning yields over $8 for every $1 invested, by helping kids learn to read at grade level, stay in school, avoid crime, get good jobs, and pay taxes. The PRE-K Act creates a new federal-state partnership to improve and expand state preschool programs to serve more children in need. States that already have a high-quality preschool program could get grants to expand and serve more children. Other states with small or newer programs could apply for startup funds if they submit a plan to establish a high-quality preschool program within two years. PRE-K Act funds could help states hire and train early educators; expand preschool days and hours; or provide comprehensive services such as health screenings and meals.

The PRE-K Act was introduced with the following original House and Senate cosponsors: Reps. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), Rep. David Price (D-NC), and Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA); Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).###==

Title: Pocan and Ellison to Introduce Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment
Date: January 22, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), today introducedH.J.Res.25with Reps. Steve Cohen (D-TN) and Judy Chu (D-CA) and 21 House Democrats to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the U.S. Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and protect this fundamental right.

While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution in fact contains no expressed guarantee of an individual's right to vote, a point that was confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision inBush v. Gore. Only a constitutional amendment can ensure this right will be guaranteed in the future."A core principle of our democracy is the ability for citizens to participate in the election of their representatives,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."We have seen constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. This amendment would affirm the principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen. As the world's leading democracy, we must guarantee the right to vote for all.""Our nation is stronger when we make it easy for Americans to participate in democracy,"Rep. Keith Ellison said."But states all over the country are passing laws to make it harder to vote. A guaranteed right to vote in the Constitution would go a long way towards increasing access to the ballot box for all Americans."

"With more than 300 successful voting rights lawsuits over the last 2 decades, the Supreme Court striking down critical Voting Rights Act protections, and states across the South making it harder for citizens to vote, it is clear that more must be done to protect this cornerstone of our democracy,"said Congressman Steve Cohen."Our constitutional amendment would clearly and unequivocally guarantee the right to vote for each and every American, and would be an important step forward in the march for civil rights.""It is shocking that in a country dedicated to the principle of government by the people, for the people, there is no constitutionally enshrined right to vote,"said Rep. Judy Chu."Without a right to vote, minorities are at risk of being excluded. We saw this when women were told to keep out of government, we saw it in the Jim Crow South, and I've seen it in my own family's experience with the Chinese Exclusion Act. Universal suffrage is still recent in American history, and it is dismaying to see it already under attack by status quo stalwarts who fear the diversity that makes America so great. That is why I am a proud original cosponsor of the Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment that makes it clear once and for all that citizens have a fundamental right to vote. It will put a stop to the ongoing assault on voting rights we are seeing across the nation. Finally, the ability to take part in our elections will be equal to the ability to speak freely."Today, I am honored to join in support of Congressmen Mark Pocan and Keith Ellison as they introduce legislation that would add a right to vote amendment to the U.S. Constitution,"said Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr."As our civil and human rights democratic movement continues to struggle for full equality for all Americans, it's not obvious that there was a ‘before Selma' dimension to our struggle for voting rights, but that there must also be a ‘beyond Selma' dimension."

While the right to vote is essential to our democracy, according to theBrennan Center for Justice, at least 83 restrictive bills were introduced in 29 states whose legislatures have had floor activity in 2014, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.

The text of the amendment is below:

SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.

SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.==

Pocan's guest for the speech was Arianna Goodwin, a constituent from Madison, WI, who has worked numerous minimum wage jobs to support her two young children and is a participant in the Operation Fresh Start program."I applaud President Obama's bold agenda to address the growing problem of income inequality in America,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."As our economy continues to improve and recover from the great recession, too many working Americans are still struggling just to make ends meet. The President's agenda will help raise wages and build an economy that works for every American, not just the wealthy and privileged few."The President laid out important initiatives to help hardworking Wisconsinites, like Arianna Goodwin, improve their lives through education tax credits and more affordable access to community colleges,"Rep. Pocan continued."I am especially pleased President Obama pushed for critical infrastructure investments. These investments will provide good jobs for hard-working Americans and ensure our country has a 21st century transportation system to compete in the global marketplace."I also support President Obama's plan to close the income inequality gap by raising fees on the largest financial institutions and restoring tax fairness by reinstating the Reagan era capital gains tax rate for the highest earners to 28 percent to pay for initiatives which will benefit the middle-class and tax breaks for hard working Americans,"said Rep. Pocan."Investing in education opportunities will also ease the economic squeeze on working families."While I support much of what the President had to say tonight, I am disappointed he pushed for an expansion of our nation's flawed trade policies,"Rep. Pocan said."I support fair trade, but I cannot support more bad trade deals that will hurt our American jobs and American industries. I hope President Obama and U.S. Trade Representative Froman are open to the concerns my colleagues and I have expressed about the consequences of fast-track legislation and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations."Now that President Obama has laid out his agenda to help grow the middle-class and sustain our economic recovery, the onus is now on Congress to act,"concluded Rep. Pocan."The American people cannot wait any longer for a gridlocked Congress to take action. It is time to move our country forward, but we can only make progress if we work together to increase opportunities for every single American."

Title: Republicans Block Pocan Amendment to Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015
Date: January 13, 2015
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today criticized House Republicans for blocking consideration of hisamendmentto H.R.185 –Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015which would protect America's servicemembers and their families from predatory lending practices. Pocan's amendment would empower the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to use regulations within theMilitary Lending Act (MLA)to prevent disreputable lenders from charging service men and women excessive interest rates."Predatory lending harms the morale of troops and their families and undermines military readiness," said Rep. Mark Pocan. "It's shameful Republicans prevented the House from having a full and open debate on this important issue. Instead they chose to protect predatory lenders and their tactics over protecting our men and women in uniform and their financial livelihoods."

Congress passed theMilitary Lending Actin 2006 - to protect servicemembers from abusive predatory lending practices. However, the law left open many "loopholes" allowing lenders to continue to peddle some high-interest credit products. The Military Lending Act caps interest rates for military families at 36 percent. However, the limit only applies to three specific financial products: payday loans up to $2,500, auto title loans and tax refund anticipation loans. Some unscrupulous lenders responded by changing their products to fall outside the regulations, allowing many of the predatory lending practices to continue."We protect our service men and women with the equipment they need when they go into battle, so it's important to make sure we protect them from predatory lending here at home," continued Rep. Pocan. "This amendment was a step in the right direction, but thanks to House Republicans, predatory lenders will be able to continue to exploit loopholes in the law and take advantage of our servicemembers and their families. It's necessary to ensure regulators can continue to keep pace with industry practices in order to protect military personnel from this type of predatory lending."

The amendment would allow the DoD and the Obama administration to move forward onproposed regulationsto expand servicemember protections in theMilitary Lending Act.

Ina new report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau said,"The products that have been marketed and extended to servicemembers while the current Military Lending Act regulations have been in place underscore the limitations of those regulations in protecting servicemembers and their families across the credit marketplace."###==

Title: Pocan Cosponsors the Respect for Marriage Act

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, signed on as an original cosponsor of theRespect for Marriage Act, introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (NY-10). This bill would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 (DOMA) in its entirety, providing equality under the law and certainty for all married couples with regard to critical federal obligations and benefits."With over 35 states recognizing same sex marriages, it is time we bring more fairness and stability to the lives of these married couples and their families," said Representative Mark Pocan. "TheRespect for Marriage Actwould ensure equal treatment under federal law and finally put to rest the awful consequences of DOMA.""While we have made great strides towards equality for the LGBT community, we must continue to fight for the thousands of individuals still discriminated against merely because of whom they love," said Representative Pocan. "We must not stop fighting until all 50 states recognize all relationships equally and all citizens equally under the law."

The Supreme Court ruling inUnited States v. Windsorresulted in the federal government granting marriage recognition based on a state's recognition of the marriage. TheRespect for Marriage Actwould provide a uniform marriage recognition rule, ensuring a marriage is valid under the law of the state where performed and is recognized for purposes of federal law. This ensures key federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs recognize all married couples, guaranteeing the ability of these couples to plan for a future of mutual obligation and support with confidence.

A tireless advocate for the rights of the LGBT community, Pocan has been married to his husband Phil since 2006.###==
Title: Pocan Requests Federal Review of Wisconsin’s Parental Choice Voucher Program
Date: December 19, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02)has askedthe U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) for a review of Wisconsin’s Parental Choice voucher program, specifically examining how this program has lacked accountability standards and transparency. A GAO review will provide a thorough examination and shed light on the program’s shortcomings. This non-partisan review will help to better inform the national discussion on the importance of supporting public schools.Full text of the letter is availablehere.

“Every child in Wisconsin and across the United States deserves the right to a high-quality education,”said Rep. Mark Pocan.“Before Governor Walker tries to expand the state’s voucher program, Wisconsin taxpayers deserve to know more about the widespread reports of discrimination against students with disabilities and the insufficient academic accountability of choice schools.”

“We owe it to every student to ensure publicly funded schools – including voucher schools – provide high-quality education and protect the rights of students with disabilities,”continued Rep. Pocan.“I look forward to the GAO’s thorough non-partisan review of Wisconsin’s voucher program and clear answers to the questions we have raised.”

Wisconsin’s voucher program is central to an emerging national debate over the privatization of public education. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and many in the Republican Party have pushed the idea of expanding voucher schools nationwide – using Wisconsin as the model – without safeguarding the needs of students with disabilities and ensuring schools meet high standards of academic achievement.

Advocates for people with disabilities, including the ACLU and Disability Rights Wisconsin, have raised concerns that Wisconsin’s school choice program, either tacitly or explicitly, allows participating choice schools to discriminate against students with disabilities in their admission policies. After numerous complaints, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an ongoing investigation into Wisconsin’s School Choice program, and sent aletterin 2013 urging the Wisconsin Department of Instruction do more to “enforce the federal statutory and regulatory requirements” under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

A recent study by theWisconsin State Journalrevealed Wisconsin has spent $139 million on school vouchers to private schools that were eventually disqualified from the state’s program. Eleven schools participating in the program were removed within a year of opening due to poor educational standards, which costs taxpayers $4.1 million dollars.

Students with disabilities are underrepresented at Wisconsin voucher schools. According to theMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, of the approximately 21,000 students who attend private schools using state-subsidized vouchers, 1.6% are identified as having special education plans. This contrasts sharply with the nearly 20% of the approximately 81,000 students enrolled in Milwaukee Public Schools who have special education plans in place. Notably, in the Racine Unified School District, choice schools reported only 1 student with a disability attending their schools, out of the 165 special needs students in the entire school district.==

"Most egregious is the inclusion of a provision that loosened consumer protection regulations in the Dodd-Frank reform law and allows Wall Street to engage in many of the same risky practices that crashed the global economy in 2008. The bill also weakens campaign finance limits clearing the way for more corporate money into politics. Sneaking these changes through in a 1600 page funding bill hours before a government shutdown and adjourning for the rest of the year is not the way the American people expect us to govern.

WASHINGTON, DC—Four leading members of Congress today called on United States Trade Representative Michael Froman to ensure "real, meaningfully enforceable labor protections" are included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Democratic Representatives Rosa DeLauro, George Miller, Loretta Sanchez and Mark Pocan also requested a status update from Ambassador Froman so they can better understand what measures and assurances are being discussed as part of the TPP negotiations, which have been conducted largely in secret."Free trade agreements with nations that violate international child labor and forced labor standards not only undermine our moral authority, but they also capitalize on the lack of oversight and regulation in developing nations," the representativeswroteto Ambassador Froman. "Here in this country, we have fought hard to protect our workers, yet, our free trade policy undermines those protections by sending American jobs to countries that do not play by the rules…The opportunity to get an education and a good paying job are not only American dreams, but global dreams. We have a responsibility to ensure that under no circumstances is it acceptable for children to work in sweatshops to produce the goods we consume. We can and must do better."

This past Monday the Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs released their annual List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor report. Vietnam, Mexico, Peru, and Malaysia, one-third of the nations included in the TPP, were all cited for labor abuses in the report. Vietnam was also one of only four countries in the world cited for using both forced and child labor in their apparel sector.

Representatives of the TPP countries will meet in Washington, DC next week to hold the latest round of negotiations.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Dane County Executive Joe Parisi and Region V HHS Director Kathleen Falk encouraged Wisconsinites to sign-up for new, affordable health care plans or renew their existing plans during the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period. Open enrollment for 2015 began on November 15 and runs through February 15, but individuals who want their coverage to begin on January 1 must sign up by December 15.

More information on Health Insurance Marketplace enrollment and local resources are availablehere."The Affordable Care Act is working. It is expanding access to health care, lowering the cost of health insurance plans, and improving quality of care for Wisconsinites."said Rep. Mark Pocan."This year, there are many new, affordable options in the Health Insurance Marketplace for Wisconsin. If you already have coverage from the Marketplace, make sure you are getting the best deal, by going towww.healthcare.govand checking out the new options. With more plans to choose from this year, you may find a new plan that saves you more money through tax credits, offers more services, or includes more doctors.""The Affordable Care Act is working for Wisconsin thanks to the reforms we put in place four years ago. Nearly 140,000 Wisconsinites signed up for private health insurance coverage through the marketplace as of May. The first year of enrollment exceeded expectations and more people in Wisconsin now have health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. We now have an opportunity to build on that success," U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin said."We know that some politicians will carry on their calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act because they want the health care law to fail. But we aren't going to repeal health insurance for 140,000 Wisconsinites and we are not going back to the days when insurance companies could drop your coverage because you get sick, get older, or have a baby. We aren't going back to the days when insurance companies were charging whatever they want when you get sick and jacking up premiums and deductibles because of a preexisting condition. We are going to move heath care reform forward because the American people deserve to know their coverage will be there when they need it most.""My goal is that all Dane County residents – without exception -- have quality, affordable health care,"Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said."I am grateful to our staff and volunteers who are helping people sign up for health insurance coverage at locations throughout Dane County, including our Dane County Job Center. I urge our community to help spread the word that now is the time to sign up for health insurance during open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.""Great Progress that about 10 million more people have insurance now than a year ago,"said Region V HHS Director Kathleen Falk."But there are still many uninsured in the Dane County area. Surveys show a majority of the uninsured do not know there is this important opportunity for them to obtain affordable, quality health care from now until February 15 – with the need to purchase by December 15 for coverage to start January 1. And we encourage people who enrolled last year to shop again this year because there are even more insurers to choose from in Wisconsin.""The Affordable Care Act has greatly improved my life. My best health care insurance option used to be almost twice what my premium is now,"said Oma Vic McMurray, a Madison resident and child care provider."The problem was that I could not afford to see a doctor using my previous health care plan because my deductible was so high. Basically, I was betting I might need catastrophic health care someday more than I needed to see a doctor when I was sick. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I now have a health care plan that is truly affordable. With my current plan, not only do I get to see a doctor when I need to, but my prescriptions are affordable too. I also get a reimbursement from my health care provider as a benefit for participating in a ‘Wellness program'.""The Affordable Care Act is not just improving my access to health care, it has made my life much more humane,"continued Oma Vic McMurray."Feeling well does bring a greater sense of joy in my life, which is important in the work I do with children. I am so grateful for the Affordable Care Act for what it has given to me, my family and my whole community."==

WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) tonight issued the following statement on the President's executive actions to protect nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States:
"I am proud the President has followed through on his promise to address our nation's broken immigration system," said Rep. Mark Pocan. "However, I would have preferred Congress debate and pass the Senate's bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill."
"The President is using his constitutional authority to make much needed progress on this important issue while House Republicans continue to allow our broken immigration system to fester," Rep. Pocan said. "Congress still needs to act to permanently fix our nation's immigration laws. Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans must come to the negotiation table to reach a comprehensive and long-lasting solution."

Title: Walker Fails to Apply for Federal Education Grant
Date: October 17, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON— Last week, Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02)sent a letter, with Reps. Gwen Moore (WI-04) and Ron Kind (WI-03), urging Governor Walker to apply for a Preschool Development Expansion Grant. Unfortunately, Governor Scott Walker failed to submit an application before Wednesday's deadline depriving Wisconsin of up to $60 million for preschool programs. Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker has turned down or ignored federal grant opportunities to expand Medicaid for 87,000 Wisconsinites, to expand high speed internet service for schools, to build a high speed rail system between Madison and Milwaukee, and refused to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty resulting in cuts to Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits."I'm very disappointed Scott Walker has put Tea Party politics ahead of doing his job as Governor,"Rep. Pocan said."Playing political games with these federal grant opportunities, while neglecting our infrastructure, ignoring our most vulnerable citizens and running up a projected $1.9 billion deficit is inexcusable. Too many people from Wisconsin are being left behind as Walker prioritizes his higher ambitions."

Gov. Walker has failed to take advantage of the following federal grant opportunities:

Preschool Development Expansion Grant

Wisconsin was one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels. Governor Walkermissed the deadlineof October 15 to apply for this grant. The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.

Medicaid Expansion

In February of 2013, Walkerturned downfederal money to expand Medicaid in the state of Wisconsin. The expansion would apply to those who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $15,282.

Broadband Expansion

Walkerreturned$23 million to the federal government in 2011. This money could have been used to expand high-speed internet service in schools, libraries, and government agencies.

High-speed Rail Project

In 2010, governor-elect Walkerturned away$810 million in federal stimulus money aimed at creating a high-speed train system between Milwaukee and Madison. It's estimated that ending the project cost the state as many as 13,719 jobs.

Food-stamp Increase

Recently, Wisconsinended a programthat allowed residents access to increased food assistance paid for by the federal government through "heat-and-eat" programs. As a result of the states' decision not to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty, Wisconsin will see cuts in federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) benefits.###==

MADISON –U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) will speak this evening at SEIU's Raise the Wage Rally on the State Capitol steps at 5:30 p.m.Rep. Pocan will join with hard-working Wisconsinites to demand Governor Scott Walker raise the minimum wage from $7.25."The minimum wage is woefully inadequate to help keep hard-working Wisconsinites out of poverty,"said Representative Mark Pocan. "That's why I'm joining with workers to demand Gov. Walker give them a raise. Raising the minimum wage for 500,000 Wisconsinites would generate $500 million in increased economic activity in our state alone. This is commonsense economic policy, and as a small business owner, I also know it's good business policy."

On October 6, Governor Scott Walker and the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) responded to 100 minimum wage complaints Wisconsin Jobs Now (WJN) delivered on September 24. Despite affidavits from workers across Wisconsin demonstrating it is impossible to live on one job that pays Wisconsin's $7.25 an hour minimum wage, the DWD "found no reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage."

The current minimum wage of $7.25 pays only $14,500 per year. A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old. In 1968, the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $10.74, more than $3 above today's minimum wage of $7.25. Meanwhile, the top 1% in America has seen their incomes grow by 31% since 2009.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ron Kind (WI-03), and Gwen Moore (WI-04) sent a letter today to Governor Scott Walker urging him to apply for the Preschool Development Expansion Grant. Wisconsin is one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels.

The Governor's Office missed the September 11 deadline to notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of Wisconsin's intention to apply. With one week left until the application deadline, the Governor's Office has still not indicated that it will apply for the grant – potentially leaving millions of dollars for pre-K education on the table.

They write, "We strongly urge your administration to apply for this grant funding opportunity and allow our state the chance to compete for funding which could strengthen preschool programs for millions of children across our state."

Wisconsin is eligible for up to $15 million dollars a year in funding for a period of four years. The funding would allow some districts to expand 4-year-old kindergarten to full-day kindergarten and improve the quality of instruction for children across Wisconsin. Currently, most districts have 4-year-old kindergarten, but the state funding only pays for an average of only 2.5 hours per day.

The letter continues, "In light of reports indicating that the achievement gap among students of color and their white peers is growing in Wisconsin, it is critical that our state exercise every option when it comes to accessing grant funding to support early education initiatives."

The full text of the letter can be foundhereand below.

The Honorable Scott WalkerGovernor of Wisconsin

115 E. Capitol

Madison, WI 53703

Dear Governor Walker:

On August 18, 2014 the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services notified the state of Wisconsin of its eligibility to apply for federal funding through the Preschool Development Expansion Grants. We are pleased that Wisconsin was identified as one of 36 states eligible for this grant, which was based on the state's current program and the existing need to expand critical preschool services to more children in Wisconsin.The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.

Preschool Development Expansion Grants were created to support State and local efforts to strengthen programs in states that have been awarded with a Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge grant. According to the Department of Education, the Preschool Development and Expansion Grants will be awarded to states which have successfully implemented and sustained High-Quality Preschool Programs that reach and service vulnerable children in high needs communities.

The deadline to notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of a state's intention to apply was September 11, 2014.We were deeply concerned to learn that our state did not notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of its intention to apply for this grant which could bring millions of dollars' worth of funding to our preschool programs. The final deadline to apply for the grant is October 15, 2014.

We strongly urge your administration to apply for this grant funding opportunity and allow our state the chance to compete for funding which could strengthen preschool programs for millions of children across our state.While the deadline for this grant is quickly approaching and capacity may be an issue, we would also urge your administration to ensure that adequate staff is in place in order to respond to such opportunities in the future. Wisconsin has long been a leader in early learning and we must not miss any chance to expand opportunities for our children.

In light of reports indicating that the achievement gap among students of color and their white peers is growing in Wisconsin, it is critical that our state exercise every option when it comes to accessing grant funding to support early education initiatives. Providing children with high-quality preschool and early learning opportunities is imperative to ensuring that children, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, are able to enter the classroom on a more level playing field.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan Ron Kind Gwen Moore

Title: Pocan, Moore Seek Detailed Explanation for Governor’s Drug-Testing Proposal

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Gwen S. Moore (WI-04) wrote Governor Scott Walker to request details about his proposal to require mandatory drug testing for recipients of FoodShare and Unemployment Insurance. The signed letter is availablehere."It is time Governor Scott Walker stop blaming the poor for being poor,"Rep. Pocan said."Before coming up with new, costly, and ineffective policies, Governor Walker needs to first explain to Wisconsin taxpayers how he intends to address next year's projected $1.9 billion deficit.""Drug testing as a condition of eligibility for critical, life-saving social services is a gross insult to Wisconsin's struggling families,"Rep. Moore said."The insinuation that those battling poverty are somehow more susceptible to substance abuse is as absurd as it is offensive. Governor Walker needs to focus less on finding ways to discriminate against Wisconsin's most vulnerable and focus more on fixing his failed policies that contributed to our state's current economic trouble."

According to Hunger Task Force, states that have adopted drug testing policies have consistently demonstrated that they are invasive, costly, and constitutionally unsound.

In 2011, Florida passed a similar drug testing requirement, which courts eventually ruled was unconstitutional.

Florida Governor Rick Scott implemented drug testing for all recipients of federal benefits and state workers. The law required applicants to pay for the test and allowed denial of benefits to anyone who refused testing. From July-September 2011, only 9 failures were recorded, while 565 individuals were declined benefits due to refusal. Given that these are low-income individuals, denying benefits to those who refuse to participate assumes those individuals are drug users when in fact they may simply be unable to afford the test. By 2014, courts have repeatedly deemed the process unconstitutional, yet Florida spent nearly $400,000 defending the program in court. Only 2.6 percent of recipients in Florida tested positive for narcotics – below the national average – and theprogram cost more tax dollars to implement than it savedin denying benefits.###==
Title: POCAN, MILLER, MURRAY INTRODUCE BILL TO INVEST IN APPRENTICESHIPS, INCREASE SKILLED WORKERS
Date: September 18, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, along with Education and Workforce Committee Ranking Member George Miller (D-CA), and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) introduced the Promoting Apprenticeships for Credentials and Employment Act (PACE Act), a new bill that would support greater development of registered apprenticeship programs. The PACE Act would help prepare more highly skilled workers for in-demand industries and occupations through heightened awareness of and participation in registered apprenticeship programs.

The PACE Act would better integrate apprenticeships into postsecondary education programs and expand apprenticeship opportunities to new areas, particularly those professions dominated by women. As such, this legislation would promote new career pathways and greater economic security for women and their families."This legislation provides workers and job seekers with better access to employment, education, training, and support programs to help them secure good, well-paying jobs,"said Representative Mark Pocan."It will also improve opportunities for businesses by ensuring hard-working Americans have the skills necessary for today's most in-demand industries and occupations. Business leaders want this. Hardworking Americans need this. Everyone benefits when our middle class thrives.""In today's dynamic, global economy, there are more pathways to success than ever before. By strengthening apprenticeship programs, this critical legislation will enable young people nationwide to access these new opportunities,"said Representative George Miller. "The PACE Act will not only help young Americans find steady employment now, it will also prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow.""The PACE Act will help workers and businesses by investing in apprenticeships and increasing the number of skilled workers in growing sectors, which is absolutely critical if we hope to keep our competitive edge in the 21st century global economy."said Senator Patty Murray."This bill will build on recent laws, like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, to increase the number of highly skilled workers in various sectors of our economy. Workers in Washington state and across the country have benefitted from registered apprenticeship programs. These are investments we know have among the highest pay offs for our economy, and I am proud to stand with Rep. Miller, Rep. Pocan, and a strong coalition of businesses, workers, and educators to introduce this bill and keep this important work going.""PACE would for the first time provide a legislative foundation, and increased funding, for the Office of Apprenticeship, while also providing the Secretary of Labor more systematic advice on apprenticeship regulatory matters from key stakeholders in the system."said Sean McGarvey President of North America's Building Trades Unions. "Perhaps most importantly, PACE would provide increased capacity to administer the National Apprenticeship Act at a time when much is expected in terms of high performance skilled workforce development in the American economy. PACE, if enacted, would help to correct this imbalance between mission and capacity.""We believe that this is a strong effort to address the nation's skills gap and build a workforce that can compete and succeed in a global economy,"said Eric Spiegel, CEO, Siemens USA."Business-driven and demand-oriented apprenticeship programs allow for the development of skills to evolve with changes in industry. We applaud Senator Murray and Congressmen Pocan and Miller for introducing legislation that recognizes that real-world training is a catalyst to ensuring that individuals have the skills needed for the jobs of today and the future."

The PACE Act builds on theWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act– which, ushered by Murray and Miller, passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support, and was signed into law by President Obama – to help workers attain skills for jobs in the 21stCentury economy.

Read the full legislative text of the PACE Acthere.

The PACE Act is supported by a variety of business, labor, education, and advocacy groups, including: Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), Siemens, American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT), SEIU Healthcare Northwest Training Partnership, Rebuilding America's Middle Class (RAMC), Jobs for the Future (JFF), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), AFL-CIO, SEIU, Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE) and the Aspen Institute.

Promoting Apprenticeships for Credentials and Employment Act(PACE Act)

A highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in the global economy, support economic growth, and maintain the standard of living of the United States. According to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, by 2018 the United States will face a shortage of workers with recognized postsecondary credentials – shortages of 3,000,000 workers with degrees and 4,700,000 workers with certificates.

The registered apprenticeship program model is a longstanding, on-the-job training and education model that prepares workers for the skill demands of particular occupations and employers while, at the same time, providing the workers with recognized, portable credentials, and wages while in training.

Apprenticeships have been successful in skilled trade industries, including construction and manufacturing, as well as service industries, such as health care, and holds great potential for expansion into other industries.

A 2012 evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs by Mathematica Policy Research found that—

• the tax return on every Federal Government dollar invested in registered apprenticeship programs was $27;
• individuals who completed registered apprenticeship programs earned over $240,000 more over their careers than individuals not participating in such programs; and
• the estimated social benefits of registered apprenticeship programs exceeded their costs by more than $49,000.

And an evaluation in Washington State found that for each individual who completes a registered apprenticeship program, over the individual's career, there is a 90-to-1 return on investment, for a total net benefit of just over $300,000 for that career. Washington State also found that the general public receives a lifetime return on investment of 23-to-1, or around $80,000, for each person completing a registered apprenticeship program.

The PACE Act will:

• increase the number of highly skilled workers in in-demand industry sectors and occupations;
• increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by participants;
• increase awareness about the value of the registered apprenticeship program model as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers;
• support the development of registered apprenticeship programs with employers, joint labor management partnerships, and other program sponsors;
• support the development and expansion of pre-apprenticeship programs that lead to success in a registered apprenticeship program; and
• support a closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, the workforce development system, and postsecondary education, and will promote the awarding of academic credit for the education and training aspects of apprenticeships.###==
Title: Pocan Introduces Bill to Help Low-Income Households Pay Off Student Loan Debt
Date: September 18, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced the Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act, H.R. 5508. This bill would help low-income households who have made payments on their loans access greater equity in receiving the Student Loan Interest Deduction currently available to borrowers."Student loan debt is disproportionally affecting low-income households – burdening them with financial adversity and weighing down our economy,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."This bill will fix an inequity in our tax code and help these families, which hold 58 percent of all student debt, pay off their crushing levels of student loan debt."

Today, the average student graduates with around $29, 400 in loans, but 58% of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Nationally, student debt tops 1.2 trillion.

The Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act is supported by Supported by the American Council on Education, Association of Public-Land Grant Universities, Equal Justice Works and One Wisconsin Now. Rep. Pocan is also the sponsor of several bills targeted at addressing the student loan debt crisis includingthe Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act, H.R. 4622, andthe Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act, H.R. 5239.

BACKGROUND

Today, the average student graduates with around $29, 400 in loans. 58% of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Nationally, student debt tops 1.2 trillion. Given the extent of the student debt crisis, it is essential we give borrowers who have been crushed by student debt the opportunity to contribute productively to our economy.

Under the tax code, individuals are able to receive up to a $2,500 tax deduction for interest paid on student loans, but when a couple is married and files jointly, they are subject to this inequity and the couple can only receive a maximum $2,500 as opposed to before the marriage when each person could file and each receive up to $2,500.

The Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act, H.R. 5508, would allow married couples to access up to the full $5,000 benefit, which would have been available to individuals prior to marriage.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on the McKeon Amendment to provide $500 million in funding to Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL):"There is no debate ISIL is a terrorist organization responsible for appalling acts of violence.But there is debate about what this will actually do for the region and whether it will lead to war. This $500 million dollar down payment will only further entangle us in a part of the world most Americans want us out of."It's important to remember how we got into this mess. Bad intelligence and deception from the Bush Administration led us to – years of war in Iraq – more than 4,000 lives lost – more than $1.7 trillion spent already – and more to come as we continue to care for our men and women in uniform when they return home."That is why Congress needs to have a standalone debate and vote on war authorization. After 150 airstrikes already – it's hard to say it's not a war. When you have over a thousand troops already on the ground – it's hard to say it's not a war. When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says even more troops may be needed – it's hard to say it's not a war. The Constitution makes clear that Congress has a voice in matters of war. The need for a robust debate is even more important when we are unsure about the end game."Every briefing I have had this week, classified or unclassified, has only raised more questions. With so many questions left unanswered and the possibility of another prolonged war in Iraq, it is clear to me I cannot support this amendment."###==
Title: Pocan Introduces Legislation to Curb Corporate Tax Inversions
Date: September 11, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced three pieces of legislation to close tax loopholes which allow U.S. corporations to use so-called "tax inversions" to reduce a company's tax burden."Large corporations have taken advantage of tax loopholes to hide billions in corporate profits overseas and avoid paying taxes in the United States,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Enough is enough. This legislation will stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system. Main street businesses across Wisconsin and across the United States are playing by the rules and paying their share while Wall Street corporations, with their teams of lawyers, are finding new tax loopholes to avoid paying their share of taxes; that's just wrong."

A recent report byBloombergshows multinational companies accumulated nearly $2 trillion in accounts outside the U.S., in 2013 – an increase of 11.8 percent as corporations shift more profits to offshore tax havens.

The Obama Administration is also considering executive action to curtail tax benefits for U.S. companies that use inversions to reduce their tax burden.

BACKGROUND

Corporate inversion is a process by which an existing U.S. corporation changes its country of residence, typically to one that has lower tax rates and less stringent corporate regulations. The process involves re-incorporating overseas in order to reduce the tax burden on income earned abroad. Corporate inversions are used by companies that receive a significant portion of their income from foreign sources.

LEGISLATION:

Corporate Fair Share Tax Act

"Earnings stripping is even more costly than standard inversions,"said Rep. Pocan."This legislation closes the loophole used by companies to shirk paying their taxes and eliminates the advantage for companies to shift debt here."

Policy summary:

This provision cracks down on corporate earnings stripping, a method of avoiding taxes in which U.S.-based groups are loaded up with debt owed to the affiliated foreign company; the U.S. entity then pays high levels of interest on this debt, which nets them significant tax deductions or wipes out taxable income in the U.S. Specifically, the provision limits the deductions a corporation may claim to a level at which the U.S. entity's share of interest on debt is proportionate to the U.S. entity's share of earnings. The Treasury Department estimates this wouldincrease revenue by $48.6 billion over the next ten years.

Putting America First Corporate Tax Act

"Today, corporations are not required to pay taxes on overseas profits immediately,"said Rep. Pocan."This legislation closes an egregious loophole and requires companies to pay taxes on overseas profits immediately instead of postponing payments and indefinitely hide income in tax havens."

Policy summary:

Currently corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign profits until that money is repatriated back to the U.S., often via dividends to shareholders. Our provision changes Section 956 of the tax code to close this loophole and require controlled foreign corporations to pay U.S. taxes on future active income beginning on December 31, 2014. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending this loophole wouldincrease revenue over the next ten years by $114 billion.

Corporate Transparency and Accountability Act

"The American people deserve to know which companies are avoiding paying their taxes"said Rep. Pocan."This legislation will increase transparency on corporate financial reports and ensure the data is easily available to the public."

Policy summary:

This provision restores a previous requirement of corporations to disclose both pre-tax profits and the total amount paid in state and federal taxes. The language also mandates this information be publicly available on the SEC website in a way that is searchable, sortable, and downloadable.###==

Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today released the following statement in support of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and striking fast food workers across the country who are calling for an increase in the minimum wage:"It's time to raise the pay of fast food workers and everyone earning a low wage in this country. Companies should pay their workers fair wages and put more money in the hands of consumers to help strengthen our economy. These companies are super-sizing their profits while their workers are struggling to make ends meet."The myth of a minimum wage worker is a teenager living with their parents while working part-time after school. In fact, the minimum wage worker is a very real person who has had a stagnant wage while the rest of the economy has prospered. When millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules cannot support themselves or their families, we face an economic crisis."Raising the minimum wage is a win-win-win situation – a win for workers, a win for small businesses, and a win for the economy."###==
Title: Pocan Introduces Next Generation Research Act
Date: September 3, 2014

Washington, D.C. —U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today at a meeting with faculty and staff at the University of Wisconsin – Madison introduced the Next Generation Research Act which would improve opportunities for early career researchers. Unfortunately, current policies, including the budget sequester, are putting the brakes on research and innovation at a time when we need to step on the accelerator. Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.

The bill, introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin, creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director and also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can invest in the next generation of research."In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."This bill will ensure the next generation of researchers has the support they need to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. As our economy continues to recover, we must look down the road and invest in our young researchers, whose pioneering research will lead to improved health and quality of life for Americans and spurs innovation, U.S. economic growth, and job creation."

Over the past 10 years, individual NIH research awards have dropped to record lows, less than 20 percent of grants submitted are funded. Even fewer grants are going to early career researchers, the young innovative researchers. Without these critical investments young Americans are not pursuing degrees in STEM fields, instead choosing a different career path or leaving the country for better research opportunities. Biomedical and scientific research is a major generator of economic activity, and NIH is its largest funding source."Federally funded research helps lead to lifesaving medical innovations and technological breakthroughs which can lead to a revolutionary new industry,"continued Rep. Pocan."Congress has shirked its responsibility in recent years to be the driver of federally funded research. This bill helps early-career researchers and graduate students gain access to NIH grants to expand their research opportunities."

What This Legislation Does:

• The bill creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the NIH Office of the Director.
• The office will promote and expand current policies and grant opportunities for young scientists.
• The office will also create new policies aimed at increasing access to NIH grants for new researchers, expand workforce diversity efforts and improving mentorship between veteran and new researchers (only 1 in 6 first time researchers succeed in receiving a second NIH grant).
• The bill also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can establish the next generation of research.

Why We Need This Legislation:

• In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone added more than $62 billion in new economic activity and the creation of 432,094 jobs across the country in 2011.
• Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, Sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.
• These destructive policies are particularly devastating for our nation's young researchers. NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, cautioned that "we are putting an entire generation of scientists at risk." Currently, the average age of a first-time NIH grant recipient is 42 years old—up from 36 in 1980. Without action, talented young scientists may decide to chase another career, or leave the country to pursue their research.

Current Groups Supporting the Bill:

• The Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACSCAN), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Wisconsin Health Science Library Association, the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Midwest Chapter of the Medical Library Association.###==

Title: Pocan and Local Business Coalition Call on Congress to Close Corporate Offshore Tax Loopholes

Content:
Madison, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined Roman Candle Pizza founder and owner, Brewer Stouffer, and Wisconsin Business Alliance Executive Director, Lori Compas at a press conference to call on Congress to close the so-called "inversion" corporate tax loophole and address the broader issue of corporate tax avoidance. The press conference at Roman Candle Pizza highlighted how companies have taken advantage of the U.S. tax code through inversions, opening offshore subsidiaries and tax havens to avoid paying taxes in the United States."It is time Congress stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system and avoid paying taxes,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."Main street businesses like Roman Candle Pizza and thousands of others across Wisconsin are playing by the rules and paying their share while Wall Street corporations are finding new ways to dodge taxes. Corporations that avoid paying their taxes put the burden on American families and small businesses who have to shoulder a heavier load."

Large corporations have taken advantage of the U.S. tax code to put billions in corporate profits in overseas accounts to avoid paying taxes in the United States. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have called on Congress to take action to permanently close the "inversion" tax loophole and save nearly $20 billion over 10 years, according to anestimatefrom the Joint Committee on Taxation."Tax inversion is not a left-or a right issue, but an issue for all American taxpayers,"said Brewer Stouffer, founder and owner of The Roman Candle Pizza."Every business that has a shop or an office or a factory in the US is benefitting from all the services and opportunities our country and communities provide. They should pay for the privilege. Let's make sure that all companies are playing by the same rules that The Roman Candle and most small business do every day."

A report byBloombergshows multinational companies accumulated $1.95 trillion outside the U.S., in 2013 – an increase of 11.8 percent as corporations shift more profits to offshore tax havens."Congress should close the tax loopholes that allow large corporations to get out of their responsibility and require corporations to disclose the amount of federal income taxes that they pay,"said Wisconsin Business Alliance Executive Director, Lori Compas. "When large corporations use safe drinking water, schools, roads, and police and fire protection use just like we do, but then try to avoid their responsibility by relocating overseas, it hurts our local economy and leaves small businesses like ours footing the bill. We pay our fair share, and so should they."###==

MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI–02) today toured the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison and held a listening session with hospital officials. The tour and listening session gave Rep. Pocan a chance to hear firsthand the challenges facing VA hospitals and reinforced the need to fully fund efforts to provide veterans with health care."It is our duty to ensure Wisconsin's 400,000 veterans receive the support and care they deserve,"said Representative Mark Pocan. "Visiting facilities, like this one in Madison, is key to identifying challenges VA hospitals are facing. Paying for our veterans' health care needs is part of the cost of war and we must fully fund efforts to provide veterans with the support they have earned defending our nation.""The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, which the President signed yesterday, is one of many steps towards remedying the issues in the VA, but we must continue to have open discussions with VA staff and patients,"continuedRepresentative Mark Pocan. "This enables Congress to more effectively provide resources and support where it is most needed."

Rep. Pocan recently voted for Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, H.R. 3230, which provides the VA with funds to hire additional primary and specialty health care providers to increase the department's capacity to provide high-quality care to our nation's veterans. Additionally, the bipartisan bill expands the VA ability to lease new clinics allowing more veterans to receive more timely care. Yesterday, the President signed H.R. 3230 into law.###==

Title: Pocan and Wilson Introduce Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act
Date: July 29, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. —U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson (FL-24), both members of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced the Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act, H.R. 5239. This bill would allow student loan borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt an exemption from being taxed on the amount forgiven."Student loan debt is weighing down our economy and holding back a generation of Americans as total student loan debt has grown to more than $1.2 trillion – more than total U.S. credit card debt,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."This legislation closes a major gap in our tax code which penalizes some borrowers who have been granted debt relief after at least 20 years of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt.""As a member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, college affordability is one of my top priorities. Today, student debt is at a record high, with individual debt forcing many people to put off major purchases such as buying a home or automobile,"said Congresswoman Wilson."This bill prevents student loan borrowers from being hit with an additional tax burden for debt that has been forgiven after 20 years of consistent repayment, and in the event of suffering a total permanent disability or death, this bill prevents the debt forgiven from being considered taxable income. The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act helps individual borrowers and their families, as well as strengthens the economy."

Background:

Under current law, the student loan balance forgiven as part of the Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay as You Earn (PAYE) programs, is treated as taxable income to the borrower, creating a tax liability that most qualifying borrowers would be unable to afford. Student loans forgiven under other programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness and TEACH Grants, are not treated as taxable income.

Earlier this year, President Obama formally widened the pool of eligible participants in the Pay As You Earn Program (PAYE) which will help an estimated additional 5 million people manage their debt. Borrowers who have demonstrated a good faith effort at repaying their loans and are currently underwater deserve a fair shot.

Today, the average student graduates with around $29,400 in loans. At private nonprofit colleges, average student debt is around $32,300. Nationally, student debt tops $1.2 trillion. Given the extent of the student debt crisis, it is essential to give borrowers who have been crushed by student debt for two decades the opportunity to get out from under those loans and further contribute productively to our economy.

This legislation has been endorsed by The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), Young Invincibles, the Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Council for Opportunity in Education, U.S. PIRG, Equal Justice Works and the American Council for Education.

Key Facts:

· There are 1.4 million people enrolled in the Income Based Repayment (IBR) program.

· There are 190,000 people enrolled in Pay as You Earn (PAYE) program which was expanded by Pres. Obama this year.

· Of the $1.2 trillion in student debt, over $1 trillion is owned by the Federal Government.

· Fifty-eight percent of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Additionally, outstanding student loan debt is a 25% share of the same bottom-fifth's income, compared to 12% of the middle-fifth and only 2% of the richest 10% of families.

· Currently, 791,000 borrowers in Wisconsin have outstanding federal loans.

· Currently, 2,238,000 borrowers in Florida have outstanding federal loans.###==

The bill passed the House by a vote of 414-0:"I am pleased to work with my colleagues on the Education and Workforce Committee to pass H.R. 3136, the Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Projects Act of 2014, because this bill represents a common sense solution for many adult learners looking to advance their careers."This bill allows for the creation of a competency based demonstration project that will allow colleges and universities to test innovative new program structures which could reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a degree, which would make earning a higher degree more affordable and accessible to more Americans."Competency-based education shifts the focus to what works best for adult learners. Instead of awarding credits based on how much time students spend learning in class, this approach awards credits based on whether students can prove they have mastered competencies—the skills, abilities, and knowledge required in an area of study."Back at home, the University of Wisconsin has been developing the UW Flexible Option at multiple UW institutions to convert existing degree programs and curricula in to competency-based delivery models. I'm proud that UW has been a leader in this field, and believe that UW's successes in this area can be replicated across the country."This bill helps promote a new and important educational path for many students who otherwise would not be able to complete a degree. I look forward to seeing the bill pass the Senate and be signed by President Obama."###==

Title: Pocan Says WTO Ruling Against U.S. Tariffs on Chinese and Indian Goods Indicative of Bad Trade Deals

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. —U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today criticized the ruling by a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel which sided with claims brought by China against U.S. tariffs imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce to protect American industry."Today's ruling by the WTO only highlights how bad trade deals have weakened the United States' ability to stand up for our domestic industries and businesses,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."American companies and workers are left vulnerable to China and India because we have given away our sovereignty through bad trade practices which allows the WTO to keep tilting the playing field to benefit other countries."

The World Trade Organization's judges said the United States broke WTO rules by imposing hefty tariffs on steel products, solar panels and a range of other goods that benefitted from Chinese government subsidies. The WTO also overturned U.S. tariffs against unfairly priced steel exports for India's three major firms."State sponsored subsides provide an unfair advantage to Chinese and Indian businesses and force American companies to compete in an unfair and distorted market,"continued Rep. Mark Pocan."These unfair subsidies harm our domestic industries, cost American jobs, and put American businesses at a disadvantage. We cannot afford to let an outside entity, like the WTO, put American jobs and the American economy at risk. If allowed to compete on a fair playing field, I have no doubt our workers and businesses will prevail."

The United States imposed these tariffs because the products were being dumped in the U.S. market to help Chinese and Indian companies expand their market share. U.S. law empowers the Commerce Department to impose extra duties when it has determined that foreign goods are being "dumped" into the U.S. market or sold at below market prices to corner a share of business unfairly.###==

Washington, D.C. —U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today issued the following statement urging United States Trade Representative Michael Froman to stop providing Congress with trade data that distorts exports and hides the true nature of our nation's trade deficits."I am calling on Ambassador Froman to stop sending to Congress figures on our trade deficit that include the re-export data. USTR's use of re-export data hides the dismal reality of failed trade policies,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."USTR should instead use data from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), which provides more accurate information by removing re-exports, and paints a more realistic picture of our trade imbalance.""By providing re-export data which incorrectly inflates the number of actual exports, USTR misleads Members of Congress and the public about the true costs of our trade agreements on jobs and manufacturing,"Rep. Mark Pocan said."If USTR insists on providing lawmakers with such skewed information, it will only jeopardize the credibility of our country's trade negotiations and USTR with Members of Congress."

USTR currently provides export data obtained from the Census Bureau that fails to reflect the negative impact on the U.S. trade deficit and domestic manufacturing and production jobs. This data recognizes "re-exports", or goods that are imported from a foreign country then immediately exported to another, as an authentic American export. Labeling these products as exports downplays the detrimental impact of trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA on the U.S. trade deficit, and fails to present the public and their Representatives in Congress with accurate data on the impact future trade agreements will have on domestic jobs and the economy.###==

Pocan. "This bipartisan legislation will strengthen our workforce system and give workers and job seekers access to employment, education, training, and support services to help them secure good, well-paying jobs and advance their careers."

WIOA streamlines the nation's workforce development system by creating smaller, nimbler, and more strategic state and local workforce development boards. It provides local boards the ability to tailor services to best meet the needs of their region and gives states greater flexibility to address their unique needs."I have made job-creating policies a number one priority and this bill will help to put Wisconsinites back to work and ensure long-term, sustainable growth that will drive our economy for years to come,"Rep. Pocan said. "This bill includes critical funding for workplace and job training programs that prepare our workers for the jobs of today and the future."

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act emphasizes access to "real-world" job training opportunities through on-the-job, incumbent worker, and other customized programs. It also provides improved outreach to out-of-school youths and improves training programs for individuals with disabilities.

The bill passed the Senate on a95-3 voteand passed the House today with broad bipartisan support by margin of 415-6.###==
Title: Pocan and Transportation Coalition Call on Congress to Protect Highway Trust Fund
Date: July 7, 2014

Madison, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined representatives from a coalition of building trades unions and highway industry associations at a press conference near the Verona Road construction project to call on Congress to save the federal Highway Trust Fund."We're gathering here today because we are worried that Congress will not act in time. If Congress does not act by the end of August, the Highway Trust Fund will run dry,"warned Rep. Mark Pocan."This would impact nearly 700,000 jobs across the country next year. Today, there are more than 100,000 active projects across the country, just like the one here at Verona Road. If Congress does not act soon, states like Wisconsin may have to choose which projects going on across the state continue and which ones will have to be delayed because of insufficient funds."

States initially fund highway construction projects and then get reimbursed for the costs through the Highway Trust Fund. The question now is whether states will be paid back in a timely manner. Without the vital funding from the Highway Trust Fund, projects across Wisconsin could be left without the necessary resources to complete construction on schedule. If financial support from the Highway Trust Fund lapses, the cost of restarting delayed projects could balloon the costs and further jeopardize future construction.It could also lead to job losses in the region and prolong delays for commuters."Hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and many right here in south central Wisconsin are counting on Congress to do its job so we can keep doing ours,"said Dave Branson, Executive Director of the Building and Construction Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin."Our members live in the local community and take pride in the work that they do. They want to be sure the job can get done so their families can drive on new and safe roads. They want to complete job without fear that the money may dry up and they could be out of a job."

The Highway Trust Fund is "user-supported" through a federal gas tax. The HTF shortfall stems from the fact that the gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993. All while the country's population has grown substantially and cars have become more fuel-efficient. Reduced financial support and the growing cost of surface transportation construction projects have resulted in the financial crisis the fund is facing today."Local businesses and communities rely on our roads and highways,"said Jim Hoffman, President of Hoffman Construction Company."Without the guarantee funds that will be available, some states have decided to put projects on hold, because they don't want to risk unfinished projects left without funding. Stopping the crisis facing the Highway Trust Fund will require Congress to take action before the end of August. We're all counting on them to do the right thing."###==
Title: House Democrats Urge State Department to Stop Conditioning MCC Compact on El Salvador’s Seed Purchase Program
Date: July 1, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Mike Honda (D-CA), were joined by 14 other Democratic Members of Congress in sending a letter to the State Department requesting that they desist from conditioning the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact on the Salvadoran government's seed procurement for the Family Agriculture Plan:"I believe the United States should not exercise undue influence on El Salvador's democratic political processes and policy-making, especially not in any way that jeopardizes programs like the Family Agriculture Plan, which provides essential support for small family farmers and national food security,"said Rep. Mark Pocan."El Salvador's commitment to help lift their citizens out of poverty should be commended. We must continue to work together as partners with the Salvadoran people to help both countries achieve our shared goals.""My years as a Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador in the 1960s showed me the great strengths of that nation,"said Rep. Mike Honda."I have long supported El Salvador's democracy and development. Strengthening local capacity, independence, and sustainability is at the heart of development. That is why I strongly urge that MCC support and sign the compact without further delay. It is in the best interests of both the US and El Salvador."

Full text of the letter is below and a signed copy is availablehere. Spanish version of release is availablehere.

Dear Secretary Kerry:

We were heartened by your comments following the election of El Salvador's new president, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, which expressed your commitment to maintaining a strong relationship between our two governments. More than two decades after the country's Peace Accords were signed, El Salvador is now a mature and stable democracy, and one that is making an admirable effort to address long-standing issues of poverty and inequality.

We write in regards to U.S. relations and development assistance to El Salvador. Specifically, we are concerned that the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact with El Salvador, which the MCC Board approved last fall, has not yet been administered. We are troubled by reports that this delay is related to the Office of the United States Trade Representative's (USTR) concerns regarding the Salvadoran government's procurement of seeds for its national food security program. El Salvador's domestic food security program should neither impact the terms of the compact, nor should the U.S. use it to unduly pressure El Salvador. As Chair of the MCC Board, we urge you to support the immediate, final approval and implementation of the agreement.

In 2007, MCC, the U.S. agency that provides five-year grants to selected governments for country-led development efforts, signed its first agreement with El Salvador, providing $461 million for roads and other improvements to spur development in northern El Salvador. The evaluation of that agreement was positive, and the MCC entered into negotiations with El Salvador for a second compact, focused on issues related to development along El Salvador's Pacific Coast. On September 12, 2013, following the resolution of a multitude of technical and political issues, the MCC Board in Washington approved a second compact, for $277 million.

Since that time, the Salvadoran government has taken executive and legislative actions to accommodate various reform requests raised by MCC stakeholders, on issues related to the pact. However, over eight months have passed without any indication about when the compact will be signed. Immediate approval is needed for the country to move forward with development planning.

We are concerned that the delay in final approval is being used to exert undue influence on El Salvador's democratic political processes and policy-making. We are particularly troubled by U.S. authorities' insistence upon a condition that would hamper the government's national food security program.

Launched in 2011, the Salvadoran government's Family Agriculture Plan seeks to improve the livelihoods of nearly 400,000 small farmers living in poverty. Modeled loosely on a successful program in Brazil, the Plan provides agricultural inputs for small farmers, including seeds for two of El Salvador's staple crops, maize and beans, and helps support local markets for farmers' products.

Reportedly, final approval of the MCC compact has now been conditioned on eliminating a provision – first passed by the Salvadoran legislature in December 2012 and renewed for another year in January 2014 – which enables the government to purchase the seeds for its Family Agriculture Plan program from small-scale producers who might otherwise be excluded from the process. USTR has expressed concerns regarding this provision with regards to compliance with the United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and has sought to impose as a condition for the MCC compact a change in this process of government procurement of seeds.

The Salvadoran government has demonstrated that it has recently carried out a transparent bidding process, in which a number of domestic and international producers competed. This mechanism has thus enabled the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to ensure that the government can purchase better quality seeds at lower prices for the Family Agriculture Plan. It has successfully increased the market access for many of El Salvador's small-scale producers and helped financially stabilize those producers. This is a modest program that has that helped stabilize the rural sector and improve livelihoods and reduce poverty, and it will make producers more competitive over time.

To condition the final approval of the MCC compact on the elimination of a provision that enables local producers to access government procurement mechanisms poses a risk to El Salvador's national food security efforts. Agriculture and food security are outside the scope of the compact, yet critical to the country's development. For both of these reasons, elimination of support for small-scale farmers to improve their livelihoods through domestic seed production has no place as a condition for signing the MCC compact with El Salvador.

We believe it is in the best interests of U.S. foreign policy and development policy to desist from conditioning the MCC compact on the Salvadoran government's seed purchase for the Family Agriculture Plan. We respectfully request your swift action to ensure that the signing and administration of MCC compact will, ultimately, uphold the U.S. development goals of poverty reduction, and independent and sustainable development. In addition, we look forward to your timely response regarding the steps you will continue to take in order to ensure the agreement's final approval and implementation.

Quinn:"The Supreme Court's decision undermines the rights of home health care workers in Illinois and workers across the country. The decision overlooks the changing reality of the workplace, where partial employment and contingent work arrangements are becoming more common. The court weakened the ability of labor unions to provide critical support to maintain a stable and well-trained workforce. While the Supreme Court's decision is a setback, the fight for fair wages and safe working conditions for America's workers continues forward."==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep.

Thus, the Supreme Court has limited the personal healthcare decisions of women across the United States. The right of women to make their own choices about their healthcare is fundamental and deserves absolute protection."###==

Today, thousands of loving gay and lesbian couples have their marriage recognized by the federal government and enjoy benefits afforded to them equally under the law."Since the Supreme Court struck down DOMA, thirteen out of thirteen federal court rulings striking down state marriage bans have cited theWindsoropinion and not a single ban on gay marriage has survived a federal court challenge."Yet until all 50 states in our union recognize all relationships equally and all citizens equally under the law, there will be too many people left behind merely for who they are and whom they love.

The same Speaker who allowed the government to shut down last October, now intends to sue the President of the United States for acting while Congress has not, instead voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act 54 times and turning the tragedy in Benghazi into a manufactured scandal."In fact, the least productive Congress in modern history – the so-called ‘Do-nothing Congress' of 1948 – passed 350 bills in their first year; this Congress passed fewer than 100 bills in its first year. It is ironic the Speaker would sue the President for doing his job while the House of Representatives fails to do its job."Speaker Boehner is allowing the Tea Party tail to wag the dog. It is clear he has chosen to be the Speaker for the extreme right-wing of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, this Republican controlled House of Representatives has no intention of actually governing and will continue to block any effort by President Obama at the expense of our constituents."###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today sent aletterto Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction, Dr. Tony Evers, supporting the Department of Public Instruction's (DPI) full compliance with the United States Department of Justice's examination into potentially discriminatory practices occurring within the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program:

Full text of theletteris available below.

Dr. Tony Evers

Superintendent of Public Instruction

P.O. Box 7841

Madison, WI 53707-7841

Dear Dr. Evers:

I am writing in support of the Department of Public Instruction's (DPI) full compliance with the Department of Justice's examination into potentially discriminatory practices occurring within the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program.

Throughout its tenure, the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program has elicited serious complaints regarding discrimination against students with disabilities, but recent allegations are especially egregious. I have closely followed reports that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program discriminates against students with disabilities during the admissions process. Allegations made by families, Disability Rights Wisconsin, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin assert that private schools participating in the voucher program have instituted policies which create barriers for students with disabilities and intentionally block them from school admission. Additionally, concerns have been raised that some students with disabilities have been expelled or forced to leave voucher funded schools as a result of school policies that do not accommodate their needs.

According to the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal, in 2011, of the nearly 21,000 students attending private schools using a state-subsidized voucher 1.6% of students have an individual education plan identifying them as in need of special education services. This figure is especially alarming when considering that nearly 20% of the students in Milwaukee Public Schools have special education plans in place.

I encourage DPI's full and fair compliance with the Department of Justice's examination into this important issue. I am deeply troubled by these allegations and sincerely hope that DPI and the Department of Justice will work to ensure that the rights of students with disabilities are upheld.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan

Member of Congress

Title: Baldwin, Kind, Moore and Pocan Send Letter to U.S. Attorney General Asking for Federal Recognition of Same-Sex Married Couples in Wisconsin
Date: June 16, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Congressman Ron Kind (WI-3), Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-4) and Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-2) have sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder asking that the same-sex couples in Wisconsin who have received marriage licenses be recognized for federal purposes.

They write, "To date, same-sex couples across Wisconsin have received marriage licenses, and officials in counties throughout the state continue to issue licenses to eligible couples. These loving couples have valid marriage licenses and should receive the same federal recognition that all other married Wisconsin couples currently do."

Following last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, the Department of Justice has led the federal government's effort to ensure that all lawfully-married same-sex couples have equal access to federal rights and benefits. As a result, couples who had legally married are able to access benefits including federal taxes, immigration, federal employee and service member benefits, and family and medical leave.

The letter continues, "Now that Judge Crabb's decision has allowed many of them to obtain marriage licenses, the federal government should provide Wisconsin's married same-sex couples with all of these federal benefits now available to them under the law."

The full text of the letter can be foundhereand below.

The Honorable Eric H. Holder, Jr.

The Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

Washington, DC 20530

Dear Attorney General Holder:

We write to ask you to formally recognize for all federal purposes the marriages between same-sex couples that have been performed in the State of Wisconsin since a federal district judge invalidated the state's constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage on June 6. To date, same-sex couples across Wisconsin have received marriage licenses, and officials in counties throughout the state continue to issue licenses to eligible couples. These loving couples have valid marriage licenses and should receive the same federal recognition that all other married Wisconsin couples currently do.

On June 6, U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that Wisconsin's constitutional and statutory restrictions on marriage for same-sex couples violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. She did not immediately stay her decision and, within hours, some county clerks opened their doors to same-sex couples seeking to marry. On Friday, Judge Crabb issued a stay of her decision while the state pursues an appeal, thereby suspending further marriages in the interim.

Following last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision inUnited States v. Windsor, you have led the federal government's effort to ensure that all lawfully-married same-sex couples have equal access to federal rights and benefits. As a result, couples who had legally married are finally treated equally and are able to access:

· the ability to sponsor a foreign spouse for legal residency in the United States;

· health, workers compensation, retirement and other benefits for the spouse of a federal employee;

· health benefits, spousal ID cards, housing allowances and on-base support services for the spouse of a service member;

· joint federal income tax filings, as well as spousal exemptions from federal taxation of gifts, inheritances and the value of employer-provided spousal health coverage;

· unpaid family and medical leave to care for an ill spouse;

· and hundreds of other rights and benefits.

However, until last week, same-sex couples in Wisconsin were unable to receive these benefits because they could not lawfully marry. Now that Judge Crabb's decision has allowed many of them to obtain marriage licenses, the federal government should provide Wisconsin's married same-sex couples with all of these federal benefits now available to them under the law.

Earlier this year, you made clear that couples who married in Utah and Michigan after federal judges struck down those states' bans are entitled to full federal recognition. We are grateful for this tremendous leadership on behalf of fairness and equality. We ask that you similarly declare that those same-sex couples who married in Wisconsin since the June 6 decision are equally entitled to the federal benefits they deserve.

Sincerely,

Tammy Baldwin Mark Pocan

Title: Pocan Statement on Presidential Executive Order Protecting LGBT Employees of Federal Contractors
Date: June 16, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, today issued the following statement on President Obama's executive order which protects LGBT workers from employment discrimination by federal contractors:"I am pleased to see President Obama take action to ban employment discrimination by federal contractors. This protection for LGBT workers is long overdue. Congress must still act on the Employer Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) to ensure all workers are protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. We need to give LGBT workers a fair shot to get ahead in life by making sure employers cannot fire, harass, deny a raise, or refuse to hire someone based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Only 21 states have made it illegal to fire or harass someone based on sexual orientation, or to deny a raise or refuse to hire on that same basis. Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue, becoming the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982.###==
Title: Pocan Has Limited Confidence In FDA’s Current Status on Wood-Aging in Cheese Making
Date: June 13, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after a phone conversation with an official from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clarifying its position on banning the practice of wood-aging in cheese making:"After my call with FDA officials, I have limited confidence in their current status regarding wood-aging in cheese making. Furthermore I now see the bipartisan amendment that would prevent the FDA from banning this practice as more necessary than ever. While the FDA may think its position is clear to Washington bureaucrats, cheese makers in America's Heartland and I have been left unclear on the FDA's actual intent and future plans regarding cheese making. I look forward to creating a more fruitful partnership between the FDA and cheese makers in Wisconsin. However, further action is necessary to ensure Wisconsin cheese makers can continue to operate as they have for centuries in a safe and successful manner. This fight is not over."

Background

The FDA traditionally uses a "comment rule-making" process as a way to include public discussion on a particular issue before making a final ruling. In this case, the FDA has not adequately communicated to the cheese making industry on best practices.

On June 11, Rep. Pocan announced he will join colleagues from Wisconsin, Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon, Connecticut, New York and California to introduce a bipartisan amendment that would prevent the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from banning the practice of wood-aging in cheese making.

• Wisconsin, the nation's largest cheese producing state, with more than 11 million pounds of cheese produced in 2013.

• The Wisconsin dairy economy, almost half of the state's agricultural economy, has an annual economic output of about $26 billion and supports about 11,000 family farmers.

• Wisconsin dairy industry is the state's single largest industry in terms of economic impact.

Title: 119 Members of Congress Call on United States to End Trade Negotiations with Brunei

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), and Henry Waxman (D-CA), along with 114 of their House colleagues, today sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and United States Trade Representative Michael Froman insisting the United States stop any further negotiations with the government of Brunei Darussalam on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement until Brunei addresses its human rights violations – part of its newly adopted a penal code.

The letter joins a growing coalition of groups that have called on the United States to stop trade negotiations until Brunei revokes its inhumane criminal code.

Full text of the letter is available below andonline here.

Dear Secretary Kerry and Ambassador Froman:

We write to express our concern over the Government of Brunei Darussalam's recently adopted penal code, which threatens the human rights of minority groups including women, religious minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, and urge you to insist that Brunei address these human rights violations as a condition of the United States participating with them in any further Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations.

As Members of Congress, we believe that protecting fundamental human rights is a cornerstone of American values and must always be a priority in our relations, both diplomatic and economic, with foreign countries. The United States is committed to protecting the rights of religious minorities, LGBT individuals and women across the globe. Moreover, time and again, the United States has spoken out against anti-LGBT activity and discriminatory laws in countries like Nigeria and Uganda and against unequal protection of women, in countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and against the persecution of religious minorities in the Central African Republic, China, and Pakistan.

Brunei's adoption of the revised penal code legalizes violence against its citizens, constituting torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. The United States must make it clear that we will not tolerate such abuses. International trade partners have much to gain from an economic relationship with the United States, and our trade agreements should insist that participating countries adhere to internationally recognized civil, political, and human rights standards. Targeting LGBT individuals or religious minorities and opening the door for discrimination and violence against women is a threat we cannot overlook, and should trade agreements like the TPP go into effect with the participation of human rights violators, the United States would lose its leverage to provide economic pressure on countries to reverse unacceptable policies.

As the world's largest economy, the United States holds a significant place in world affairs and must use this position to address human rights atrocities in countries like Brunei. According with all applicable rules and regulations, we urge you to insist that Brunei address these human rights violations as a condition before the United States enter into any trade negotiations.###==

This amendment seeks to protect hundreds of small business owners and artisanal cheese makers in Wisconsin and across the country. Government regulations should protect consumers from bad practices and those who break the rules, not ban a proven, centuries-old process which would devastate American cheese makers. It is unfortunate the FDA issued this rule in a misguided attempt to protect consumers."

Background

The FDA traditionally uses a "comment rule-making" process as a way to include public discussion on a particular issue before making a final ruling. In this case, the FDA did not use this process and instead went ahead and banned the wood-aging process.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today issued the following statement on President Obama's call for the Senate to pass legislation that would allow Americans to refinance their outstanding student loans at lower interest rates currently available to new borrowers."While there are many steps that must be taken to address college affordability, I am proud that Senate Democrats are taking up Senator Elizabeth Warren's student loan refinancing legislation and taking action to address a problem affecting many within Wisconsin's 2nd Congressional District and across the country."Unfortunately, the House of Representatives still is failing to act on any critical legislation to help ease the burden of student debt facing an estimated 25 million Americans."With only 28 days until the House of Representatives is expected to adjourn for August recess, I call on Speaker Boehner and the House Republican Leadership to act on student loan refinancing proposals, expand rights for student borrowers and other legislation aimed at ensuring college remains accessible and affordable. We cannot ignore the millions of college graduates who are buried under crushing levels of student debt."

BACKGROUND

Congressman Pocan represents the 2nd Congressional District of Wisconsin which includes the state's largest university – the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Pocan has been especially focused on college affordability issues affecting working class families. Congressman Pocan has worked very closely on student loan refinancing policies.

This Congress, Congressman Pocan introducedH.R. 3047andH.R. 4622that would allow borrowers to refinance their loans whenever lower rates become available. He is also an original cosponsor of theBank on Students Emergency Refinancing Actwhich was introduced in the House by Representatives Tierney and Miller and in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren. This legislation further underscores the importance of allowing borrowers to refinance their loans by including refinancing options for both public and private loans.

According tooriginal research by One Wisconsin Institute, the student loan debt crisis has been shown to be a huge drag not just on borrowers' household budgets, but the entire state economy, reducing new car purchasing by over $200 million annually and leaving middle class households with student loan debt more likely to rent than own a home.

In Wisconsin, the average student graduates from college owing $22,460 in student loans. Nearly 800,000 individuals in Wisconsin currently have outstanding student loans. By allowing the average borrower to refinance their loans at 4%, they would be saving $8,483 over the 20 year life of the loan.###==

National Small Business Week recognizes the immense contributions of the country's small business owners to the economy and culture of America:"Small businesses are the backbone of Wisconsin's economy, and they are vital to ensuring our nation's long-term growth and job creation," Pocan said. "When we support our small businesses owners, we support our local communities, and our economy. As a small business owner myself, I know firsthand the challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to build and expand their business.""It is clear our tax code unfairly benefits large corporations through tax loopholes and giveaways unavailable to most small businesses," said Pocan. "We should reward the small business owners of America with the resources and flexibility they need to help their businesses grow. From providing tax incentives for businesses to create jobs here in the United States, to reducing burdensome and confusing paperwork, to ending the sequester that cuts $900 million in critical small business loans, we can take proactive steps to empower our small business owners with the tools and certainty they need to get people back to work."

A lifelong advocate for small businesses, Pocan has co-sponsored the following bills to support small businesses and promote economic growth:

• Make it in America Manufacturing Act (H.R. 375)

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), U.S. Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), along with21 House Democrats, today introducedH.R. 4622: Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act. The Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act would call on the Secretary of Education to automatically lower all federal student loans to 4 percent – which is near the current 30-year mortgage rate. Refinancing allows the borrower to replace his or her existing debt with a new loan at a lower interest rate. This means that borrowers will reduce the cost of their debt and free up income for purchases that will create a ripple effect on the economy. The bill introduced today is the House companion to S. 1066 which was introduced by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in the U.S. Senate."Two-thirds of Americans now leave college weighed down by massive student loan debt, unable to achieve their dreams and contribute to the growth of the economy," Pocan said. "Our bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like you can refinance a house or car loan, freeing up funds to buy a house, get a new car, support a family, and pursue greater economic opportunities. Congress should be doing all that it can to make a college education as affordable and accessible as possible.""While there are many steps that need to be taken in order to increase college affordability, this bill addresses an issue that will help 90% of consumers with existing student loan debt," Pocan continued. "This important legislation will respond to the immediate need for relief from the student loan crisis.""Affordable higher education for lower and middle class families has been central to the American story, including my own," Rep. Peters said. "I would not have been able to attend college without student loans and work study programs. We should be making it easier and more affordable for students to get a college education, not keeping it financially out of reach for middle class families. We need to educate our kids to be competitive in the global economy; it's an investment in our economic future, and an investment in American families."

Peters continued, "Students and families across San Diego would save thousands of dollars under this legislation, giving them greater flexibility when they graduate, and providing some necessary, and welcome, relief to those struggling to advance themselves.""I am proud to stand with Rep. Pocan and Rep. Peters, and their cosponsors, to address the crushing amount of student debt facing our graduates and their families," said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. "It is clear that higher education is the clearest path to the middle class, yet there is now over one trillion dollars in outstanding student loans, many with outrageously high interest rates. As a result, instead of starting businesses and families or buying homes and cars, these graduates and families need decades to pay off their debt. There is a solution is right in front of us - allow our graduates to refinance their debt in the same way that our businesses and homeowners do. Providing this common sense solution will strengthen the middle class and grow our economy. We cannot afford any more delay. "

BACKGROUND

According tooriginal research by One Wisconsin Institute, the student loan debt crisis has been shown to be a huge drag not just on borrowers' household budgets, but the entire state economy, reducing new car purchasing by over $200 million annually and leaving middle class households with student loan debt more likely to rent than own a home.

In Wisconsin, the average student graduates from college owing $22,460 in student loans. Nearly 800,000 individuals in Wisconsin currently have outstanding student loans. By allowing the average borrower to refinance their loans at 4%, they would be saving $8,483 over the 20 year life of the loan.

In California, 13.7% of consumers have student debt, owing an average of $25,650 in student loans. Furthermore, 11.9% of all California borrowers have defaulted on their Federal loans between 2009 and 2012. Currently, nearly 4 million borrowers in California have outstanding Federal loans. By allowing the average borrower to refinance to 4% they would be saving $9,668.15 over the 20 year life of the loan.

Congressman Pocan represents the 2nd Congressional District of Wisconsin which includes the state's largest university – the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Pocan has been especially focused on college affordability issues affecting working class families. Congressman Pocan has worked very closely on student loan refinancing policies.

In the fall of 2013, Congressman Pocan introduced a bill that would allow borrowers to refinance their loans whenever lower rates become available. Rep. Pocan is also an original cosponsor of the Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act which was introduced in the House by Representatives Tierney and Miller and in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren. This legislation further underscores the importance of allowing borrowers to refinance their loans by including refinancing options for both public and private loans.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin's ruling that Wisconsin's voter identification law unfairly burdens disadvantaged and minority voters:"The federal district court in Milwaukee made the right decision to protect the rights of Wisconsin voters. The voter ID law pushed by Gov. Scott Walker and Republicans in the state legislature infringes on every American's fundamental right to vote. This is a critical step towards reversing a dangerous movement across the country that unfairly restricts disadvantaged and minority voters' access to the polls. But, the fight is not over. We need to affirm every citizen's right to vote without condition."

In 2013, Pocan introducedlegislationwith U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (MN-05) to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. The Pocan Ellison Voting Rights Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and empower the government with the authority to protect this fundamental right.###==

Title: On Tax Day, Pocan Calls for a Fairer Tax Code for the Middle Class
Date: April 15, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on Congress to take steps to restore tax fairness for America’s middle class families.

“It’s clear our tax code unfairly benefits the wealthiest Americans, while middle class families struggle to make ends meet. Economic inequality has grown over the past decade and it’s time for Congress to work together on tax reforms to fix this injustice. We must close unfair tax loopholes, end special interest tax breaks for corporations, and reform the tax code to support the creation and retention of good-paying jobs here in the United States,"said Representative Pocan.

According to ananalysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, the Republican budget would raise taxes on middle class families with children by more than $2,000 per year to pay for an average tax cut of $200,000 for the very wealthy and corporations shipping jobs overseas. The Republican proposal would also shift long-term costs onto the backs of seniors and the middle-class by turning Medicare it into a voucher program and slashing investments in infrastructure and the education of our children.

“Unlike the Republican budget, Democrats have put forward plans to cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to spur economic growth and build an economy that works for everyone,”continued Representative Pocan.“We should not mortgage the future of our children to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and corporations shipping jobs overseas. Together, we can close the opportunity gap by strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, investing in our infrastructure and our children’s education, and responsibly reducing the deficit.”

His expertise with transportation and education issues is unmatched. I have always been impressed with Tom’s willingness to work across the aisle to do what is best for the people of Wisconsin.”

“Through it all, Tom has remained a thoughtful legislator who has put his constituents first,”continued Representative Pocan.“Congress will miss his independent spirit.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on House passage of the Republican budget proposal:

“For the 4th year in a row House Republicans have laid out a road map for what they would do if they controlled the House, Senate, and the White House,”said Representative Pocan.“The consequences of the Republican budget would be very real to the 3 million Americans who could lose their jobs, the millions of seniors who would see Medicare turned into a voucher program, and the millions of students who would see higher student loan rates and interest payments. Luckily for 98% of Americans who would be hurt by the Republican budget, it is not going anywhere.”

According to theEconomic Policy Institute, the GOP-Ryan budget would have a devastating impact on American workers and the larger economy. EPI estimates that the Republican budget plan would decrease GDP by 0.9 percent and decrease nonfarm payrolls by 1.1 million jobs in fiscal year 2015, compared to CBO’s current-law baseline. In 2016, when the Republican budget cuts to discretionary spending starts, GDP would decrease by 2.5 percent and cost 3.0 million jobs – the equivalent of firing Wisconsin’sentire workforce.###==
Title: Pocan Introduces Legislation to Help Address Long-Term Health Care Costs

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Wisconsin colleague U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble (WI-08) this week introduced bipartisan legislation that will provide the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) with the tools and resources necessary to conduct better long-term analyses about the costs and benefits of future health care legislation.

H.R. 4444, the "Long-Term Studies of Comprehensive Outcomes and Returns for the Economy Act" or "Long-Term SCORE Act," would create a new long-term scoring division dedicated to analyzing legislation and its impacts on federal programs, particularly ones that focus on investments in medical research and disease prevention, over the next fifty years.

“The Long-Term SCORE Act will help us by providing the structure to the Congressional Budget Office to regularly and efficiently handle requests for long-term cost estimates,”said Representative Pocan.“One of the key drivers of increased health care spending in the United States is the prevalence of chronic diseases. We know that investing in effective prevention programs early can save taxpayers money in the long-run. This bipartisan agreement will help Congress make the smart decisions today that will improve the quality of life for Americans in the future.

More than 60 top economists endorse the Long-Term SCORE Act

Title: Pocan Introduces Minimum Wage Amendment to Republican Budget
Date: April 2, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) todayintroduced an amendmentto the Republican FY2015 budget proposal which would raise the minimum wage for nearly 28 million Americans, including more than 500,000 Wisconsinites, and lift millions of people out of poverty:

“America deserves a raise,”said Representative Pocan.“The minimum wage has less value today than it did in 1968 and American workers have not seen an increase in the minimum wage since 2009. Raising the minimum wage would benefit 28 million Americans immediately and lift millions out of poverty. This would help stimulate the economy immediately by making sure people have money in their pockets and that money is put back into the economy immediately.”

Representative Pocan’s amendment would increase the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage. The current minimum wage pays only $15,080 per year.

Raising the minimum wage is critical to help lift those working hard to support their families out of poverty. A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old.

“The myth of a minimum wage worker is a teenager living with their parents while working part-time after school,”Representative Pocan continued. “In fact, the minimum wage worker is a very real person in all of our districts who has had a stagnant wage while the rest of the economy has prospered. Raising the minimum wage is a win-win-win situation – a win for workers, a win for small businesses, and a win for the economy.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on Chairman Paul Ryan’s FY2015 Republican budget proposal:

“Is this April Fool’s Day or Groundhog Day,”asked Representative Pocan.“The Republican budget is more of the same reckless and irresponsible choices – more conservative, more austerity, more wrong-headed cuts to vital programs such as food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid, and more tax giveaways for oil companies and big corporations which outsource jobs.”

“The Republican budget stacks the deck against seniors and working families making the American dream harder to reach. With deep cuts to education and job-training, the GOP budget sets America back instead of investing in our future. Budgets should reflect our values. And the Republican budget released today does not reflect Wisconsin’s or America’s values. Americans want a plan that creates good paying jobs and promotes economic opportunity for all. This is just another austerity budget to score points with the Tea Party but is not a practical or serious approach to our nation's future.”

Title: #TruthInTrade Day 10: Trade Agreements Make it Easier and More Lucrative to Build Sweat Shops Abroad
Date: March 28, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today continued his #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the unintended consequences of free trade agreements. Last week the campaign focused on concrete examples of how multinational corporations use legal advantages allowed by trade agreements to overturn laws protecting the environment and people. This week the stories will focus on the potential threats trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), pose to food safety, environmental protection, jobs, and the economy. More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

“Trade agreements promote the practice of sending jobs overseas where work is done in sweat shops, while disregarding the rights of workers around the world,”said Representative Pocan.“Trade deals allow multinational corporations to take advantage of unfair labor practices and unsafe working conditions to rake in billions. On top of that, these deals not only ship jobs to foreign countries, but they depress U.S. wages and make it harder for jobs to be created here in America. ”

The abysmal working conditions and despicable wages workers face in countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam are well documented. Minimum wages of 28 cents an hour and almost no days off of work are the norm. The collapse of Rana Plaza garment-factory in Bangladesh last year left more than 1,100 people dead. In Vietnam wages are only about two thirds of what wages are in China making Vietnam attractive to multinational corporations looking to make billions off of cheap labor. This all means more jobs shipped overseas, in sweatshop-like conditions.###==

#TruthInTrade Day 9: Trade Agreements Could Trump Domestic “Buy American” Laws

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today continued his #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the unintended consequences of free trade agreements. Last week the campaign focused on concrete examples of how multinational corporations use legal advantages allowed by trade agreements to overturn laws protecting the environment and people. This week the stories will focus on the potential threats trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), pose to food safety, environmental protection, jobs, and the economy. More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

“Buy American laws help grow our local economy,”said Representative Pocan.“Allowing foreign companies the same opportunity as domestic firms to bid on local and state government contracts would be disastrous for small businesses across the country. Foreign companies would not have to comply with U.S. labor, environmental or safety standards and could drive down the cost of goods and services by utilizing unfair labor practices, unsafe working conditions and other inferior goods. We cannot allow badly negotiated trade deals to undermine our local businesses and hurt American workers who work for them.”

Twenty-one states have “Buy American” laws, which require state governments to choose domestically produced products and materials over foreign ones when possible. In Wisconsin, a state “Buy American” law, authored by Rep. Mark Pocan, requires all contractual services paid for with state taxpayer dollars to be performed within the United States. With state and local governments spending close to $2 trillion annually on goods and services, these domestic “Buy American” laws contribute tremendously to local economies across the country.###==

“People have a right to know what’s in their food,”said Representative Pocan.“Trade agreements could empower corporations to sue state and local governments and overturn local laws requiring genetically engineered food is clearly identified. This could make it harder for consumers to make choices about the food they eat.”

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) is already present in an estimated 75% of the foods in America's restaurants and supermarket shelves. For example, genetically engineered salmon, created in a secretive research base in the Panama rainforest, grow at almost twice the rate of a normal Atlantic salmon. This modern day “frankenfish” has been approved for public consumption, but do you know if the salmon you’re eating is modified or not? Nearly half of all U.S. states have introduced laws requiring labeling or prohibiting genetically engineered foods. Trade agreements could make it harder for you to find out what you are eating – including things like “frankenfish” – by overturning state laws that require GMO’s to be labeled.###==

The rankings showed three counties from the 2ndCongressional District – Iowa (#10), Green (#14), and Dane (#17) – are among the healthiest in Wisconsin.

The County Health Rankings measure the overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states. The Rankings allow counties to see how well they are doing on 29 factors that influence health including smoking, high school graduation rates, employment, physical inactivity, and access to healthy foods. These rankings help local community health organizations to work together to create a culture of health that benefits everyone.

“It’s great to see all the hard work of our communities to improve the quality of health across the 2ndCongressional District,”said Representative Pocan.“The data from the

County Health Rankings is one source of information communities can use to work with local partners and develop strategies to ensure that every county in Wisconsin is a healthy community.”

“We can’t allow multinational corporations to drain our precious resources, reaping billions in profit, with no ability to have local control over these resources,”said Representative Pocan.“Over and over again, we have seen how trade agreements could give multinational corporations a legal advantage over local water rights and local environmental protection laws. Our communities and the safety of our constituents should not be threatened by the expansion of these destructive practices, while lacking local control, under potential trade agreements.”

Multinational water bottling companies drain U.S. communities of their water for next to nothing, bottling and selling tap water for billions in profits – dumping the environmental costs onto the community. Local control is wrestled away from residents who are helpless to stop destructive water extraction practices in their communities. The loss of groundwater from these practices can alter the level and flow of springs, lakes, rivers and drinking water wells resulting in economic and environmental devastation. Trade agreements negotiated in secret could make it easier for these multinational water bottling companies to secure local water rights, bypass local environmental protection laws and drain communities of their precious resources, not even allowing local laws protecting water extraction to apply.###==

TPP could allow seafood, beef or chicken products imported from Asia that don't even meet basic U.S. food safety standards on your dinner plate. A recentBloombergstory highlighted the disgusting conditions of imported seafood; including processed shrimp and fish fed with pig feces destined for American grocery stores and restaurants. Currently, the United States imports more than 100 million pounds of shrimp from Vietnam every year and the FDA only inspects about 3 percent of imported food. Trade agreements could increase imports of contaminated food, overwhelming already overworked food inspectors, and overturn regulations aimed at keeping the American food supply safe.

“Americans should not have to wonder if their dinner sat in baskets covered with flies and was shipped in bacteria ridden ice before ending up on their plate,”said Representative Pocan.“No one wants to eat salmonella contaminated food. Trade deals put everyone at risk by undermining important American food safety regulations and making it easier for filthy food to enter the United States. ”

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today continued his #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the unintended consequences of free trade agreements. Trade deals negotiated behind closed doors, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have allowed international firms to overturn domestic environmental regulations and other laws that protect public health and safety. More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

In 1997, the Canadian Parliament placed public safety ahead of a company’s desire to sell its products in Canada by banning the import and interprovincial transport of the toxic gasoline additive MMT. Ethyl, the American multinational company that put the lead in leaded gasoline, claimed the Canadian import ban on MMT violated various provisions of NAFTA and sued Canada for $251 million. Canada eventually settled the case and reversed the ban on MMT.

“It’s wrong and inexcusable to let a free trade agreement override laws designed to protect citizens from harmful chemicals,”Representative Pocan.“This suit demonstrates the serious danger that trade agreements could pose to our health and safety. If NAFTA did not exist, MMT would still be banned in Canada. Fast-tracking trade agreements through Congress prevent the thorough oversight needed to protect every American.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today continued his #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the unintended consequences of free trade agreements. Trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have allowed poorly regulated trucks and drivers from Mexico on American highways. Today’s trade deals put international corporate interests ahead of domestic public safety policies and give foreign corporations more power than citizens. More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

“It is important all foreign trucks and drivers on U.S. roads meet U.S. safety standards,”said Representative Pocan.“It’s wrong and inexcusable to let a free trade agreement endanger the American public in this way. NAFTA puts the public at risk by allowing foreign firms to dodge our safety laws.”

NAFTA included a provision that guaranteed access to U.S. roads and highways for Mexico’s truck fleet. The trade agreement did not require Mexican trucking standards be brought up to U.S. standards. In fact, reports by the Department of Transportation Inspector General revealed severe safety and environmental problems with Mexico’s truck fleet and drivers’ licensing.

After a NAFTA “court” imposed sanctions of$2.4 billionon the United States for failing to open access, trucks from Mexico were allowed on U.S. roads starting in 2011. Even so, an association of Mexican trucking firms is demanding$30 billionfrom U.S. taxpayers to compensate for the years they could not drive on American highways as NAFTA promised.###==

Without proper oversight, Americans could see our natural resources funneled away by multinational corporations with no return investments in our own communities.”

ExxonMobil and Murphy Oil used NAFTA to challenge a Canadian regulation which required oil companies to pay fees to support renewable energy research and development in Canada’s poorest provinces. Another questionable trade court ruled in favor of Mobil and Murphy Oil, deeming the requirement to use larger-than-expected oil revenues to fund research and development as a violation of a NAFTA-barred performance requirement.###==

This is the second release of this week’s #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the serious health, safety, and economic risks associated with fast-tracked trade deals. Today’s trade deals allow companies to seek damages through kangaroo courts and puts countries at a disadvantage when trying to clean-up toxic spills or prevent further pollution by foreign companies.

“This is another instance of an international corporation using a trade agreement to bully a government,”Representative Pocan said.“Every American deserves to know exactly what effects proposed trade agreements will have on the environment, the economy, and their own health, safety, and jobs. Congress must have the time to conduct thorough and careful oversight of trade agreements that could have serious consequences for our constituents.”

Few countries understand the harmful consequences of hastily-ratified trade deals better than Peru. La Oroya, Peru –one of the world’s most polluted sites– has been compared to Chernobyl due to toxic contamination from nearby metal refineries. Most of La Oroya’s children suffer from elevated lead levels, according to the Peruvian government. Parents say some have symptoms consistent with lead poisoning that include anemia, convulsions, stunted growth, and developmental delays.

The Renco Group, a New York-based mining giant,claimedthe Peruvian government violated the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement by not granting the company a third delay to install smokestack scrubbers in the metal refinery, the source of the pollution. Renco is now demanding $800 million from Peru, arguing that the government’s environmental regulations violate its rights under the free trade agreement. Shortly after Renco filed its trade case, the Peruvian government reversed course and allowed the smelter to reopen. The refinery still operates without the proper filtration equipment needed to keep it from spewing lead and other toxic materials on the town.###==
Title: #TruthInTrade Day 1: Big Tobacco Uses Bad Trade Laws to Fight Anti-Smoking Protections
Date: March 17, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today launched his #TruthInTrade campaign to highlight the threats free trade agreements – negotiated in secret – pose to the American people. Poorly-crafted trade deals have made it easier for Big Tobacco to promote their harmful products to children and teens, by challenging regulations on cigarettes and other tobacco products. More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

“Trade deals which put Big Tobacco ahead of children and families are not in anyone’s best interest – especially not our national interests,”Representative Pocan said.“The threats of expensive litigation and harmful de-regulation of dangerous tobacco products presented by free trade deals are very real, and I will continue to do all I can to ensure that Congress retains its ability to closely investigate and oversee potential trade agreements. I remain committed to protecting the health and safety of all citizens through thorough oversight of all foreign trade agreements.”

Tobacco companies have been using trade and investment agreements to challenge and undermine anti-smoking health policies – threatening the ability of countries to protect the health of their citizens. For example, Philip Morris International sued Uruguay under a bilateral investment treaty over policies to counter the tobacco industry’s use of the deceptive marketing terms.

Uruguay’s anti-smoking initiatives have received accolades from the World Health Organization; including a law requiring 80% of cigarette packaging to contain health risk warnings and a ban on variations in packaging that suggest lower health risks from some tobacco products. Philip Morris demanded Uruguay pay millions in compensation and eliminate the policy, which applies to both domestic and foreign tobacco brands. The case is still pending.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today began a two week long campaign to highlight the harmful effects free trade agreements, like NAFTA, have had on our economy and environment. The goal for this campaign is to raise awareness about the serious health, safety, and economic risks associated with fast-tracking trade deals. From Big Tobacco making it easier for teens to buy cigarettes to the impact on jobs here at home, these stories will show the true consequences if free trade agreements like the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) are fast-tracked through Congress using Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). More information about #TruthinTrade is availablehere.

“Wisconsinites have seen what happens when these types of free trade deals are rushed through Washington: contaminated food and toys, closed factories, and lost jobs,” Representative Pocan said. “If we do not learn from history, we are doomed to make the same mistakes of the past. I am launching this campaign to raise awareness about the serious health, safety, and economic risks associated with massive trade deals. Congress must have the time to conduct thorough and careful oversight of trade agreements that could have serious consequences for our constituents.”

Title: New Analysis: 40,000 in Wisconsin Cut Off Unemployment Benefits
Date: March 5, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on ananalysisby Ways and Means Committee Democrats which shows more than 2 million Americans have been cut off of federal unemployment insurance benefits including almost 40,000 Wisconsinites:

“This latest analysis shows more than two million people have lost their unemployment benefits as a result of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program’s expiration. One vote in the United States Senate is all that stands in the way of relief for nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites who have lost their unemployment insurance benefits and are still desperately trying to find work. Instead of offering a helping hand, Republicans in Congress have given the long-term unemployed a cold shoulder. Every additional week that Congress remains in a stalemate, 1,600 additional people in our state will lose unemployment insurance, meaning that without action, almost 100,000 Wisconsinites could be left without these vital benefits by the end of 2014.”

Title: Rep. Pocan Joins Effort to Force Vote on the Fair Minimum Wage Act
Date: February 27, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) took action today to force an up-or-down vote on legislation which would give 24.5 million Americans, including more than 500,000 Wisconsinites, a pay raise and lift approximately 900,000 people out of poverty. Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010). The bill increases the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage.

“The minimum wage is woefully inadequate to help keep hard-working people out of poverty,” Pocan said. “When millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules cannot support themselves or their families, when they live in poverty, we face an economic crisis. That’s why we must raise the minimum wage, which would give 24.5 million Americans and more than 500,000 hard-working Wisconsinites a pay raise and generate $500 million in increased economic activity in our state alone.”

The current minimum wage of $7.25 pays only $14,500 per year, so this increase would lift approximately 900,000 Americans out of poverty. This is critical to those working hard to support their families. A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old. In 1968, the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $10.74.###==

Civil rights pioneers like Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, Bayard Rustin, and Fannie Lou Hamer paved the way for leaders like Wisconsin's own Vel Phillips, a civil and community rights pioneer who served as the first woman and African American Secretary of State and successfully fought to establish fair housing laws in Milwaukee.

This year, I am especially proud to recognize the 50thanniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This law, shaped by both high-profile national leaders and everyday Americans, was monumental for its prohibition of discrimination based upon race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in all spheres of public life.

From politics to the arts, and from business to the sciences, African Americans continue to shape the course of our nation's identity and future. Please join me in celebrating the incredible history and achievements of African Americans in the United States. As we look to the future, I pledge to do all I can to ensure liberty and justice are truly ‘for all'."==

Title: Expiration of Federal Unemployment Benefits to Cost Wisconsin Economy Over $51 Million in January and February Alone
Date: February 18, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) issued the following statement regarding today’snew analysisfrom Ways and Means Committee Democrats that projects the Wisconsin economy will lose more than $51 million, and cost the U.S. economy $3 billion, in January and February alone due to the Dec. 28 expiration of federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation. More than 1.8 million Americans, including more than 31,000 Wisconsinites, have now been cut off extended unemployment insurance because Republicans continue to block an extension of the program.

“Refusing to extend long-term unemployment benefits not only threatens the livelihoods of thousands of Wisconsinites, but has cost our state economy more than $51 million in the last two months alone,” Pocan said. “There are few programs that more immediately stimulate the economy than unemployment insurance because these benefits are almost always put right back into the economy to pay for basic necessities, such as food or fuel. Republicans will continue to inflict serious damage to our economy if they do not join with Democrats and renew this vital, economic lifeline.”

Pocan, who had pressed Speaker Boehner to address this issue in December, is a sponsor of theEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, which would extend the emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for an additional year.

Adding salt to the wound, failure to extend federal unemployment insurance would also hurt job growth throughout the nation, costing the economy 310,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while decreasing GDP and increasing government spending for other safety net programs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that in Wisconsin alone, failing to extend the program will cost more than 5,000 jobs.###==

While we have made progress to spur economic growth, this report finds that unemployment and underemployment still hurt our economy and contribute to our long-term deficit. We need an economy that works for everyone, not just the one percent. That means providing every American with a fair shot to increase their standard of living and purchasing power."The fastest and most effective way to reduce our long-term deficit and help millions of families is to put people back to work. Instead of focusing on jobs, House Republicans continue to pursue an agenda that does nothing for Americans struggling to find work. Speaker John Boehner seems content to sit on the sidelines as more than 1.7 million Americans, including 31,000 Wisconsinites, try to cope with the loss of their unemployment insurance. Leaving these Americans out in the cold not only makes it harder for them to find work, but also does unnecessary harm to our economy. I will continue work with my colleagues on balanced, substantive steps we can take to ensure we have a strong economy that works for everyone."###==
Title: Pocan & Rangel Applaud Senate Introduction of Restore Honor to Service Members Act
Date: January 30, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Charlie Rangel (NY-13), lead sponsors of the bipartisan “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” today applauded the introduction of this bill in the U.S. Senate by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” which Pocan and Rangel introduced in the House in July, would instill the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” into law and ensure that gay and lesbian veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation receive the honor and recognition they deserve. A statement from Pocan and Rangel is below:

“We applaud Senators Schatz and Gillibrand for introducing the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” in the Senate and standing up for our gay and lesbian veterans. This bill would close the book on “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” and provide tens of thousands of gay veterans, who selflessly risked their lives for our nation. Our bill already has the support of more than 140 House members, and we look forward to working with Senators Schatz and Gillibrand to ensure it can pass Congress and get to the President’s desk.”

The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Since World War II to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the characterization of the discharges varied, many members received discharges that were classified as"other than honorable" or "dishonorable", particularly prior to the implementation of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy in 1993. In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a "general discharge", a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries.

The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the President's State of the Union address. Pocan's guest for the speech was Brian Krueger, a constituent from Mount Horeb, who recently lost his emergency unemployment insurance due to Congressional inaction. Earlier this month,Pocan joined with Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)to encourage their colleagues to invite a constituent who has lost unemployment benefits to the President's speech."The President tonight laid out a strong vision for our country—one of increased opportunity, reduced income inequality and greater economic growth. He also importantly pointed out that while our economy continues to improve and recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression, too many people are still struggling just to get by. Until our economy works for every American, not just those at the top, we will not see widespread American prosperity."I was pleased that President Obama laid out important initiatives that will help get Wisconsinites back to work and jumpstart our local economies. But the onus is on Congress to act. The President is using his executive authority to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for new federal contract workers, providing thousands of Americans with a livable wage. Now Congress must honor a hard day's work by raising the minimum wage for the millions of Americans who are struggling to provide for their families."The President also talked about ways to help the long-term unemployed re-enter the workforce. Now Congress must, finally, end the hardships for millions of Americans and extend emergency unemployment insurance for more than 30,000 Wisconsinites fighting to find a job. That includes my guest for tonight's address, Brian Kreuger of Mount Horeb, whose family is on its last savings since he lost his unemployment benefits in December. Brian, and thousands of people in Wisconsin, don't have time to wait for Congress to act."As the President said, "we are stronger when America fields a full team." We cannot continue to leave hard working Americans behind and hope to tackle the challenges of our time through innovation and ingenuity. Like our Wisconsin motto, it is time for our country to move Forward. But we can only do that if we work together to expand opportunity for every single American."==

U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) announced today that he will take Mount Horeb resident Brian Krueger as his guest to tomorrow’s State of the Union Address. Mr. Krueger, a steamfitter who was laid off from his job this past June, lost his unemployment insurance on December 28thbecause Congress failed to take action to extend this vital lifeline. Earlier this month,Pocan joined with Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)to encourage their colleagues to invite a constituent who has lost unemployment benefits to the President’s speech.

Brian is one of more than 30,000 Wisconsinites, and 1.6 million Americans, who have lost their unemployment benefits since December 28th.

“I am honored to bring Brian Krueger as my guest to the State of the Union,” Pocan said. “Even though more than 1.6 million Americans, including over 30,000 Wisconsinites, have already lost their unemployment benefits while Congress stands on the sidelines, numbers alone do not tell the full story of the devastating consequences of our inaction. Brian and his family know firsthand the challenges millions of out-of-work Americans face to support their families while tirelessly looking for a job. I am hopeful that Brian’s story, and the stories of millions of jobless Americans from across the country, will finally spur Congress to move past politics and instead represent our constituents who are struggling just to get by.”

“I thank Congressman Pocan for inviting me to the State of the Union, and for his continued fight to help families like my own who have lost unemployment insurance,” Krueger said. “I’m working to get a job each and every day, and I know that my family is just one of thousands in Wisconsin dealing with these same issues. We need Congress to take action.”

Brian is a steamfitter who lives in Mount Horeb with his wife Bridget and two children in high school. After working for General Heating and Cooling for 10 years, he was first laid off for a year starting in November of 2010. Beginning in August of 2011, he started a two-year job building the new campus power plant. After that job was completed in June of 2013, he was laid off again.

Since that time, Brian has been applying for two to three positions a day. He’s also applied for temporary and part-time positions. He is also taking OSHA safety classes to make himself more marketable.

Brian would have been eligible for federal benefits at the end of December had they not expired. The Kruegers have applied for food stamps and the reduced lunch program for their two children, and are working with their mortgage company to keep up with their mortgage payments.

Brian’s wife initially contacted Pocan’s office in mid-January to explain their story and urge Congress to take action to extend emergency unemployment benefits.==

WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) issued the following statement regarding today’snew reportfrom Ways and Means Committee Democrats showing that by the end of this week, more than 30,000 Wisconsinites will have been cut off from their emergency unemployment insurance due to Congressional inaction—the 14thlargest number of such citizens in the nation. Since December 28th, more than 1.6 million Americans have lost their unemployment insurance. Every week Congress fails to act, another 1,600 Wisconsinites will lose this vital lifeline.

“Now more than 30,000 Wisconsinites are fighting to survive due to Congressional inaction—and that number just continues to grow the more we wait to act,” Pocan said. “Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to support these individuals who want nothing more than to return to the workforce. Congress must extend this vital lifeline so that Wisconsinites can support their families and contribute to their local economies.”

Pocan, who had pressed Speaker Boehner to address this issue in December, is a sponsor of theEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, which would extend the emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for an additional year.

Annually, unemployment insurance lifts almost 57,000 Wisconsinites out of poverty, including more than 13,000 children.

Federal unemployment insurance has been reauthorized several times as Americans continue to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Despite the real progress the economy has made since its near collapse in 2008, there are still 1.3 million fewer jobs than there were before the recession began. The percentage of jobless Wisconsinites who are long-term unemployed is near historic highs at 35 percent.

Adding salt to the wound, failure to extend federal unemployment insurance would also hurt job growth throughout the nation, costing the economy 310,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while decreasing GDP and increasing government spending for other safety net programs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that in Wisconsin alone, failing to extend the program will cost more than 5,000 jobs.==

The new initiatives, which are focused on increasing college accessibility for low-income students, will be announced today in Washington, D.C., by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank at a White House Summit on college opportunity.

“With a college degree now more important than ever to securing a quality job, we must guarantee that the doors to higher education are open to all of our students, regardless of economic status,” Pocan said. “I applaud Chancellor Blank and UW-Madison for recognizing the issues at hand and committing to new initiatives that will help ensure all qualified students in Wisconsin can access the excellent education the university provides.”

In addition to building on current efforts, UW-Madison will expand its premier pipeline programs, including the Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE) program that reaches low-income students across the state of Wisconsin. The PEOPLE program provides pre-college programming, including career and college advice, and financial aid information, and presently involves nearly 900 pre-college students and over 350 matriculated college students.

UW-Madison will also establish an Institute for Science Education (ISE), which would work with K-12 schools on programming to increase student interest in pursuing STEM degree programs, targeting schools serving low-income students. The ISE also would work closely with first and second year students to provide mentoring regarding careers in STEM, complementing existing STEM initiatives on campus such as the Women in Science and Engineering Learning Community.

UW-Madison will also improve financial aid advising to prospective low-income students and enrolled students, through increased staffing and increased financial aid for lower-income students through a new capital campaign.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Even with more than 1.3 million Americans experiencing the loss of their vital unemployment benefits, Congress appears no closer to resolving this damaging stalemate. In order to put a face on the grave impact inaction is having on millions of Americans, and to keep up the pressure for Congress to come to a solution, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Alan Lowenthal (D-CA) today encouraged their colleagues to join with them and invite a constituent who has lost unemployment benefits to the State of the Union on January 28, 2014. Each Member of Congress is given one ticket for a guest to attend the President’s speech.

Every week that Congress fails to act, an additional 72,000 Americans lose their unemployment insurance. These benefits annually lift almost 2.5 million Americans, including more than 618,000 children, out of poverty. Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the country will lose 200,000 jobs if unemployment insurance is not extended.

“As we begin a new year in Congress, few issues are more pressing than the need to extend long-term unemployment insurance for the 1.3 million Americans who saw their benefits expire on December 28, 2013, and the 72,000 additional Americans who lose this vital lifeline each week Congress fails to act,” the Congressmen wrote. “The President’s annual State of the Union Address…is an opportunity for us to put a face on this issue, and for us all to gain a greater understanding of the effect unemployment insurance has on the people we represent.

“Watching the State of the Union with a constituent struggling to get by without unemployment benefits would demonstrate that while we may disagree on the specific course of action to take, we are all concerned about the problem and committed to coming to a solution.”

A copy of the letter is below:

Put a Face on the Long-Term Unemployed: Invite a Constituent to the State of the Union who has recently lost unemployment insurance

Dear Colleague,

As we begin a new year in Congress, few issues are more pressing than the need to extend long-term unemployment insurance for the 1.3 million Americans who saw their benefits expire on December 28, 2013, and the 72,000 additional Americans who lose this vital lifeline each week Congress fails to act. Without Congressional action, millions of Americans are at risk of falling into poverty, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, our economy could lose approximately 200,000 jobs this year. Statistics and facts on their own though do not tell the full story, nor do they put a face on this important issue.

The President’s annual State of the Union Address, which this year will take place on Tuesday, January 28, 2014, is an opportunity for us to put a face on this issue, and for us all to gain a greater understanding of the effect unemployment insurance has on the people we represent.We thus encourage you to invite as your special guest for the State of the Union Address a constituent from your district who has recently lost his or her unemployment insurance, or is in danger of losing these benefits, due to Congressional inaction.

After a year filled with far too much partisan acrimony, Americans are looking for Congress to show that we can work together on the issues important to them. Watching the State of the Union with a constituent struggling to get by without unemployment benefits would demonstrate that while we may disagree on the specific course of action to take, we are all concerned about the problem and committed to coming to a solution.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan and Alan Lowenthal

Title: Pocan Opposes New Fast Track Legislation
Date: January 9, 2014
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released a statement opposing new legislation that would reinstitute Trade Promotion Authority, better known as “fast track” negotiation authority. If passed, fast track would speed up the trade agreement approval process on major trade deals, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership currently being negotiated in secret by the United States and 11 other nations, by delegating wide swaths of Congress’s Constitutional power to oversee international trade to the executive branch. If implemented, Congress would vote to accept or reject a trade agreement, but would be unable to amend the text. The bill was introduced today by House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and Ranking Member Orrin Hatch.

This summer, Pocan led a letter signed by 36 freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.

“Given how previous trade agreements have devastated local manufacturing sectors and shipped American jobs overseas, it would be unwise for Congress to ram through new trade deals without offering proper oversight,” Pocan said. “Massive trade deals—such as the Trans Pacific Partnership—now affect everything from America’s economy, to consumer and food safety, to labor standards and our environment. Blindly approving or disapproving agreements that have largely been negotiated in secret would represent a derelict of duty for Congress. If there is nothing to hide in these agreements, we should be allowed to debate and amend these deals in the open. I am committed to doing all that I can to prevent the inappropriate use of fast track in Congress.”

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on Speaker Boehner to make extending these vital benefits the first priority of 2014.

On December 28th, 1.3 million Americans, including 23,700 Wisconsinites, lost their unemployment benefits, taking up to $6.3 million out of the Wisconsin economy in one week alone. Unemployment benefits are almost always spent quickly by unemployed Americans, meaning it is money that goes right back into the economy. An additional 1,600 Wisconsinites will lose their benefits each week Congress fails to act, totaling 99,000 Wisconsinites without unemployment insurance by the end of 2014.

Pocan, who had pressed Speaker Boehner to address this issue in December, is a sponsor of theEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, which would extend the emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for an additional year.

“Threatening the livelihoods of thousands of Wisconsinites while denying our state economy a much needed stimulus is not just poor public policy, it’s cruel public policy,” Pocan said. “Each week Congress stands on the sidelines, an additional 1,600 Wisconsinites lose the ability to support their families and contribute to their local economies. If House Republicans refuse to focus on any bills that would promote job creation, the least they can do is support the millions of Americans who are desperate to find work. There are no more excuses—Congress cannot wait to act.”

Annually, unemployment insurance lifts almost 57,000 Wisconsinites out of poverty, including more than 13,000 children.

Federal unemployment insurance has been reauthorized several times as Americans continue to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Despite the real progress the economy has made since its near collapse in 2008, there are still 1.3 million fewer jobs than there were before the recession began. The percentage of jobless Wisconsinites who are long-term unemployed is near historic highs at 35 percent. Overall in Wisconsin, the unemployment rate is 6.3 percent, with more than 190,000 Wisconsinites still struggling to find work.

Adding salt to the wound, failure to extend federal unemployment insurance would also hurt job growth throughout the nation, costing the economy 310,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while decreasing GDP and increasing government spending for other safety net programs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that in Wisconsin alone, failing to extend the program will cost more than 5,000 jobs.###==

Title: Pocan Statement on Budget Proposal
Date: December 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today issued the following statement after voting against the budget proposal that sets spending levels for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.

“I am disappointed that I cannot vote in favor of the budget proposal on the House floor today. While I commend the budget conference committee on its work to reach a deal, just because Congress has a deal does not mean Congress has done its job.

“I am thankful this proposal provides some minor relief over the next two years from the devastating, across-the-board sequester cuts that were set to once again hit critical programs in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, sequestration will continue to do needless harm to our families, our students and our economy in the coming year and for years to come. We must continue to work on a solution to replace these harmful cuts once and for all.

“At the end of the day, the bill abandons 1.3 million Americans who desperately need unemployment insurance, and does nothing to promote economic growth or job creation. Furthermore, the legislation is paid for on the backs of the middle class and military families, while not touching the wealthiest amongst us and allowing corporations to continue to benefit from tax loopholes.”

“Congress shouldn’t be patting ourselves on the back just because we didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot. After a year marked by petty partisanship and Tea Party obstructionism, we have to do better. The challenges of growing our economy and strengthening the middle class are too important to keep kicking down the road. There is more work to do, and I urge the House to stay in Washington until we do it.”

Pocan was also disappointed that the deal only blocks a scheduled cut in payments for doctors under Medicare (also called the SGR formula) for three months. He supports a permanent repeal of the SGR formula.

Pocan believes voting in favor of the budget proposal would be an unjust acknowledgment that Congress has done its job. Unless Congress passes appropriations bills by the January deadline, this vote alone will not prevent a government shutdown.==
Title: Pocan Fasts in Solidarity with Comprehensive Immigration Reform Activists
Date: December 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today is fasting for 24 hours in solidarity with activists across the country to build momentum for comprehensive immigration reform. In addition, Pocan attended a press conference with fasters today on Capitol Hill to reiterate his support for their efforts and to emphasize that Congress has #MoreWork2Do on comprehensive immigration reform before the end of the year."I was moved by the tremendous resolve and passion for comprehensive immigration reform I witnessed today, and I extend my unwavering support to fasters across the country," Pocan said. "Like these courageous fasters, I believe that congressional inaction on immigration reform is no longer acceptable. I stand with the families who have been hurt by our broken immigration system, and I urge Congress to take up comprehensive immigration reform legislation before the end of the year."

The fast, organized byFast for Families, seeks to raise awareness of the vital need for immigration reform and spur law makers to action. Beginning in November, four activists fasted for 22 days and inspired solidarity fasts throughout the nation. Now, more than 20 House Democrats and activists have taken up the fast in support of passing comprehensive immigration reform.

Pocan is a proud co-sponsor ofThe Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, H.R. 15, which is modeled after the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The legislation currently has more than 190 bipartisan supporters in the House. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, enactment of the bipartisan Senate-passed bill would reduce the deficit by $850 billion.

The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act would:

• Unite families and offer hardworking immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship after passing background checks, paying penalties and taxes, learning English and going to the back of the legal immigration line.
• Reform our visa programs and our interior enforcement.
• Strengthen the E-verify program, protect workers and reward businesses who play by the rules.

Despite the fact that Congress is set to pass fewer laws this year than at almost any point in history, the House of Representatives is currently scheduled to finish its "work" in Washington by the end of this week. As part of his#MoreWork2Doweek, Rep. Pocan is highlighting many important items Congress should finish before it leaves on vacation, including the need to pass a new Farm Bill, vote on comprehensive immigration reform, and focus on legislation to promote job creation and economic growth.==

Title: Pocan Releases New Report: 65,000 Wisconsinites to Lose Jobless Aid Without Congressional Action
Date: December 10, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today continued highlighting that Congress has #MoreWork2Do before the end of the year by releasing anew reportfinding that 65,000 Wisconsinites would soon lose vital unemployment insurance without Congressional action. If Congress fails to extend the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program within the next two weeks, in Wisconsin alone:

• 23,700 unemployed workers will lose unemployment insurance just days after the holiday season on December 28, 2013.
• An additional 41,800 unemployed workers would lose their insurance in the first six months of 2014.

Today Pocan signed on as a sponsor of The Emergency Unemployment Insurance Benefits Act, which would extend the emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for an additional year.

“Without Congressional action, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Wisconsin families will be threatened just days after Christmas,” Pocan said. “As our economy continues to recover, we must maintain this vital unemployment insurance for Wisconsin job seekers who would like nothing more than to re-enter the workforce. Congress needs to come together to extend these benefits, focus on job creation, and strengthen middle class families across America.”

Federal unemployment insurance has been reauthorized several times as Americans continue to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Despite the real progress the economy has made since its near collapse in 2008, there are still 1.3 million fewer jobs than there were before the recession began. Long-term unemployment is near historic highs at 37 percent, with the unemployment rate in Wisconsin at 6.7 percent in October and more than 195,000 Wisconsinites still struggling to find work.

Failure to extend federal unemployment insurance would also hurt job growth throughout the nation, costing the economy 310,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while decreasing GDP and increasing government spending for other safety net programs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that in Wisconsin alone, failing to extend the program will cost more than 5,000 jobs.

Title: Pocan Calls on Congress to Prevent Price of Milk from Doubling
Date: December 9, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—Imagine if a gallon of milk suddenly cost $7 at every grocery store in south central Wisconsin. Unfortunately, that could become a reality starting in 2014 if Congress does not pass a new Farm Bill by the end of the year. At a press conference today in Madison at the Jenifer Street Market, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) called for his colleagues not to leave Washington until action is taken to avoid these unnecessary price increases for families and farmers in south central Wisconsin.

“Congressional inaction has already shut down the government, and now it is threatening to double the price of milk to more than $7 a gallon,” Pocan said. “This type of price increase would devastate our Wisconsin families and gravely harm our Wisconsin dairy farmers. Although the House is scheduled to finish its work by the end of the week, we will not have done our jobs if we fail to address this vital concern. I call on my colleagues not to leave Washington until we pass a Farm Bill and protect the economic security of our families and famers.”

If Congress does not pass a new Farm Bill by the end of the year, the country will revert to the outdated dairy policies of the 1940s, which would effectively double the price of milk in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average for a gallon of milk was nearly $3.50 in October.

Members of the House and Senate on the Farm Bill Conference Committee are now working to finish a final agreement on new legislation, but with the House scheduled to leave Washington at the end of this week, time is quickly running out. Reports indicate that one of the major areas of disagreement remain over cuts to the food stamp program—the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). House Republicans are advocating for $40 billion in SNAP Cuts, which would deny benefits to approximately 150,000 Wisconsinites, put 4,000 Wisconsin kids at risk of losing access to free/reduced school lunches, and result in the loss of an estimated $170 million to the Wisconsin economy just next year. Pocan voted against these cuts earlier this year.

Monday’s press conference kicked off Pocan’s#MoreWork2Do Week, where he will highlight major priorities Congress should tackle before leaving on vacation. Due to a lack of leadership from House Republicans, this Congress is set to pass fewer laws this year than at almost any point in history. Among the priorities Pocan will highlight this week include the need to pass a budget, extend unemployment insurance benefits, pass comprehensive immigration reform, and focus on legislation to promote job creation and economic growth.###==
Title: Pocan Comments on ALEC’s New Attempts to Shield Itself against Tax Laws
Date: December 3, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement on today'sGuardian storydetailing the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC) new efforts to shield itself against tax laws. When he served in the Wisconsin State Assembly, Pocan became a member of ALEC to learn more about the group and expose its potentially illegal lobbying activities.

By filing as a non-profit 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt charity, ALEC is required to verify that it does not spend more than 20 percent of its time lobbying. However, as Pocan learned when he attended the group's national conferences, ALEC spends almost all of its time lobbying—it writes model legislation on behalf of its corporate partners and then helps state legislatures pass these bills.

But according to the Guardian, ALEC is now:"hoping to avoid legal, tax and ethical challenges by creating a separate sister organisation it calls the "Jeffersonian Project". The new body would be categorised as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organisation, a designation that would allow Alec to be far more overt in its lobbying activities than its current charitable status as a 501(c)(3).""The only charity work ALEC does is on behalf of needy corporations and lonely legislators," Pocan said. "It is past time that ALEC is exposed for what it is—a corporate lobbying firm doing the bidding of corporations. As the article details, they are now trying to not only hide their intensions, but their funding as well in a new "social welfare" organization. The IRS needs to step in and strip ALEC of its ability to rig the democratic system and rob the American taxpayers."

Last year, Pocan sent a letter to the IRS urging them to investigate ALEC's tax filing. He also wrote a letter to the ALEC Chairman asking him to justify its tax filing status. He never received a response.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) announced today that he has co-sponsored comprehensive immigration reform legislation and urged Speaker Boehner to bring the bill up for a vote as soon as possible. TheBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, H.R. 15, which is modeled after the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year, currently has more than 190 bipartisan supporters in the House."Comprehensive immigration reform unites Americans from all different states, backgrounds and even political affiliations, and it's time for Congress to act," Pocan said. "Providing our country with a commonsense and fair immigration system is not only the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. It will boost Wisconsin's economy, create jobs, promote innovation, and reduce the deficit. I am proud to support bipartisan immigration reform in the House, and I urge Speaker Boehner to allow us to vote on a measure that has strong and widespread support."

The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act would:

• Unite families and offer hardworking immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship after passing background checks, paying penalties and taxes, learning English and going to the back of the legal immigration line.
• Reform our visa programs and our interior enforcement.
• Strengthen the E-verify program, protect workers and reward businesses who play by the rules.
• Secure our borders through the bipartisan McCaul-Thompson border security bill that received unanimous approval from the House Homeland Security Committee.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, enactment of the bipartisan Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform bill would reduce the deficit by $850 billion. In Wisconsin, comprehensive immigration would have meant $33 million more dollars in state and local taxes in 2010, money that could have been used to hire more teachers or first responders. And a report from the Regional Economic Models, Inc., found that a set of reforms like the Senate bill would boost Wisconsin's economic output by $490 million and create approximately 5,782 new jobs in 2014 alone.###==
Title: Reps. Pocan, Moore and Kind Call on Governor Walker to Close His Health Insurance Coverage Gap
Date: November 19, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC— Today,Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02)along withCongressman Ron Kind (WI-03)andCongresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04)sent a letter to Governor Scott Walker expressing frustration with his most recent BadgerCare decision and urging him not to delay insurance coverage for approximately 80,000 Wisconsinites.

Under Governor Walker's previous plan, about 80,000 low-income Wisconsinites would be transferred into the Affordable Care Act exchange from the BadgerCare program. At that same time, Governor Walker would accept about 80,000 new BadgerCare recipients. Last week, he announced his intent to delay the transfer. However, to offset that cost he would also delay covering those newly eligible Medicaid recipients.

“The most viable option for Governor Walker has been an option available to him all along—expand health care access in Wisconsin at no cost to the state. We simply would not be in this situation if Governor Walker had not rejected the $4 billion in federal funds to expand BadgerCare and provide families with secure, affordable and accessible health care. The health security of Wisconsin residents is too important to be used in a game of political football,” saidRep. Pocan.

“I am extremely disappointed that Governor Walker is once again turning his back on our most vulnerable populations,” saidRep. Moore. “As he touts his latest health care agenda item encouraging the legislature to keep current BadgerCare recipients on the program through March, the health of thousands could be in jeopardy. He is no hero. At a minimum, I urge our governor to keep his word and cover those newly eligible for BadgerCare beginning January 1. I continue to encourage him to stop his partisan games and accept federal funds to expand Medicaid.”

“Governor Walker never should have rejected federal support for Medicaid expansion in the first place. There are federal funds available right now for low-income Wisconsinites who need health care coverage, and all that’s standing in the way is the Governor,” saidRep. Kind. “He needs to put partisanship aside, and follow the example of many Republican governors around the country who have expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income individuals.”

The letter reads as follows:

The Honorable Scott Walker

Governor of Wisconsin

115 East Capitol

Madison, WI 53702

Dear Governor Walker,

We are writing to express our concern about the impending health insurance coverage gap that could result for the 80,000 individuals under 100% of the poverty level, as a consequence of your recent proposal to the state legislature.

Last Thursday, November 14th, we felt relief when you announced that you would allow a three-month extension of BadgerCare coverage to the approximately 77,000 low-income Wisconsinites whose coverage is due to expire on January 1, 2014. Given the challenging rollout of the Marketplaces thus far, we agree with your assessment that these individuals—who are scheduled to be transferred to the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplaces—would benefit from a longer enrollment period. We also support your proposal to extend the state’s high-risk insurance plan, known as the Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP), for three additional months.

However, we are gravely concerned about the fate of the 80,000 individuals under 100% of the poverty line, who were promised access to BadgerCare as of January 1, 2014 in your budget request. As you know, your budget would have granted BadgerCare eligibility to all those under the poverty level, including childless adults. Your Department of Health Services has been engaging in an outreach plan to the newly-eligible population, and some individuals who have applied for BadgerCare (through the Marketplaces or elsewhere) have already received confirmations of BadgerCare coverage. We were dismayed to learn that you now plan to renege on the promise to cover those below the poverty line in January 2014, and have now proposed delaying their eligibility until April 1, 2014.

The key source of our concern is that individuals below 100% of the poverty level are ineligible for premium tax credits to purchase coverage in the Marketplace. As a result of your budget proposal, the newly-eligible BadgerCare population will fall into a three-month gap in coverage; they will be unable to sign up for the BadgerCare program but also unable to purchase subsidized coverage in the Marketplace. Due to their low income level, they would not have the means to purchase coverage without a subsidy. This group would thus be in a unique and inequitable situation—essentially, worse off and with fewer options than other Wisconsinites. Given that this is a vulnerable population—they are already living in poverty and are more likely to be in poor health than the rest of the overall population—we strongly urge you to reconsider your plan for this group.

We realize that you plan to utilize the “savings” from delaying coverage for the 80,000 individuals under the poverty line to pay for coverage for about 77,000 parents currently on BadgerCare. However, we encourage you to seek alternative budgetary savings, which would allow you to provide coverage for both populations through March 2014. In addition, we once again recommend that you reconsider your choice not to fully expand BadgerCare under the Affordable Care Act. You have the option to expand BadgerCare with a 100 percent match for all newly-eligible enrollees. This funding would allow you to offset the cost of continuing coverage for BadgerCare enrollees above the poverty line.

It is time to move past politics and do what’s right for Wisconsin. The Affordable Care Act provides the opportunity for Wisconsin to receive $119 million to ensure that our most at risk populations have health care access and coverage. We urge you to join your Republican Governor colleagues and expand Medicaid. Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, among others, recognized the need to move beyond political rhetoric and put their constituents’ health first.

We remain dedicated to collaborating with you, and the Obama Administration, to ensure the best possible outcome for Wisconsin under the Affordable Care Act. We request that you consider our suggestions for the most vulnerable population in our state. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Gwen Moore

Member of Congress

Title: Pocan to President Obama: We Should Not “Fast Track” Trans-Pacific Partnership through Congress
Date: November 13, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—As the United States continues to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive new trade deal with 11 other countries that would affect nearly every sector of the American economy, Congress and the American people continue to be left in the dark on the contents of the deal. In response, today U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) joined more than 150 of his Democratic colleagues in a letter to President Obama opposing the use of the “Fast Track” process or any mechanism that would rush the deal through Congress without proper oversight and input. The letter is led by Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and George Miller (D-CA).

“Wisconsinites have seen these type of “free trade” deals rushed through Washington before, and we saw the results firsthand: closed factories, depleted industries and lost jobs,” Pocan said. “We cannot make the same mistakes of the past. If the administration wants to get the approval of Congress for this new agreement, we must take the time to conduct the careful and thorough oversight this measure requires.”

The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to oversee all international trade agreements, but previously Congress has instituted a procedure called “fast track negotiating authority” or “trade promotion authority” which speeds up the trade agreement approval process by delegating wide swaths of Congress’s power to oversee international trade to the executive branch. If implemented, Congress would vote to accept or reject a trade agreement, but would be unable to amend the text.

Members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committees are looking to develop legislation that would reinstate the outdated Fast Track procedures that expired in 2007.

“Twentieth Century ‘Fast Track’ is simply not appropriate for 21st Century agreements and must be replaced,” the members wrote. “A new trade agreement negotiation and approval process that restores a robust role for Congress is essential to achieving U.S. trade agreements that can secure prosperity for the greatest number of Americans, while preserving the vital tenets of American democracy in the era of globalization.”

As a small business owner who has seen the effects of massive trade deals and their impact on American products, Pocan has been a leader in fighting for fair trade deals that protect American jobs and American industries. This summer, Pocan led a letter with 35 other freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.

The full text of the letter is below:

Dear President Obama:

We write to express our serious concern with the ongoing negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a potential agreement of tremendous consequence for our country. Specifically, we remain deeply troubled by the continued lack of adequate congressional consultation in many areas of the proposed pact that deeply implicates Congress’ constitutional and domestic policy authorities.

For some time, members of Congress have urged your administration to engage in broader and deeper consultations with members of the full range of committees of Congress whose jurisdiction touches on the numerous issues being negotiated. Many have raised concerns relating to reports about the agreement’s proposed content. While your Administration’s goal was to sign a TPP FTA at the October 2013 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, we believe that to date the process has failed to provide adequate consultation with Congress.

Such opportunity for input from Congress is critical as the TPP FTA will include binding obligations that touch upon a wide swath of policy matters under the authority of Congress.

Beyond traditional tariff issues, these include policies related to labor, patent and copyright, land use, food, agriculture and product standards, natural resources, the environment, professional licensing, competition, state-owned enterprises and government procurement policies, as well as financial, healthcare, energy, e-commerce, telecommunications and other service sector regulations.

In light of the broad scope of today’s trade agreements, it is even more vital that Congress have a fulsome role in shaping these pacts’ terms. Given our concerns, we will oppose “Fast Track” Trade Promotion Authority or any other mechanism delegating Congress’ constitutional authority over trade policy that continues to exclude us from having a meaningful role in the formative stages of trade agreements and throughout negotiating and approval processes.

Congress, not the Executive Branch, must determine when an agreement meets the objectives Congress sets in the exercise of its Article I-8 exclusive constitutional authority to set the terms of trade. For instance, an agreement that does not specifically meet congressional negotiating objectives must not receive preferential consideration in Congress. A new trade agreement negotiation and approval process that restores a robust role for Congress is essential to achieving U.S. trade agreements that can secure prosperity for the greatest number of Americans, while preserving the vital tenets of American democracy in the era of globalization.

Twentieth Century “Fast Track” is simply not appropriate for 21st Century agreements and must be replaced. The United States cannot afford another trade agreement that replicates the mistakes of the past. We can and must do better.

We are deeply committed to transforming U.S. trade policy into a tool for creating and retaining family-wage jobs in America, safeguarding the environment, maintaining consumer protection and improving the quality of life throughout the country. We look forward to working with you to ensure that Congress and the Executive Branch are working together to meet that critical goal.==

Title: Pocan Applauds Senate Passage of ENDA & Calls on Speaker Boehner to Bring Bill Up for a Vote
Date: November 7, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today applauded the U.S. Senate on its bipartisan passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and called on Speaker Boehner to bring the commonsense legislation up for a vote in the House. ENDA would extend federal employment discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Pocan is an original co-sponsor of the House version of ENDA, which is currently supported by 196 bipartisan members of Congress.

“I congratulate the Senate for confirming our country’s commitment to respecting the rights and liberties of all Americans, regardless of who they love,”said Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill.“The basic principles of ENDA are so fundamental that 80 percent of Americans already believe it is law, and the Senate today has moved us one step closer to making that a reality. Speaker Boehner now has a choice—stand behind frivolous excuses and remain on the wrong side of history, or join with the majority of the American people and honor the equality deserved by all Americans.”

Earlier this week, Speaker Boehner said he believed that ENDA would “increase frivolous litigation.” But a report this summer from the Government Accountability Office on the 21 states and D.C. that already bar workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation found “relatively few employment discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation and gender identity”—between 3-4 percent of the total number of employment discrimination claims.

Despite the fact that a majority of Americans—including 56 percent of Republicans—and Fortune 500 companies support workplace protections for LGBT employees, currently only 17 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while an additional four prohibit employment discrimination based only on sexual orientation. According to a study from Pew Research, one of every five LGBT employees faces discrimination in their work environment because of their sexual orientation or gender indemnity.###==

Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today released the following statement after the Senate moved to advance the bipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would extend federal employment discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Pocan is an original co-sponsor of the House version of ENDA, which is currently supported by more than 190 bipartisan members.

According torecent polling, more than two-thirds of Americans, including 56% of Republicans, support a federal law protecting LGBT people from discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, non-discrimination policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity are already in effect at a majority of our nation’s largest companies

“When someone in the United States goes to work afraid they could be fired merely because of who they are, we are not living up to our ideals of equality before the law. Today, the Senate sent a clear message that in this country you should be judged on the work you do, not on who you love,” Pocan said. “The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is bipartisan, commonsense legislation that ensures all Americans have the opportunity to thrive and succeed in the workplace, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity. I urge the House to follow the lead of the Senate, a majority of Fortune 500 companies, and the American people and ensure our workplaces are free from discrimination of any kind.”

Currently only 17 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while an additional four prohibit employment discrimination based only on sexual orientation.==
Title: Pocan Sponsors Bill to Prevent Food Stamp Cuts Beginning November 1st
Date: October 31, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

MADISON, WI—Starting tomorrow, November 1st, more than 800,000 families in Wisconsin who rely on food stamps will see reductions in their benefits that will make it harder for them to put food on their tables. Due to the expiration of a temporary boost to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that was included in the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, Wisconsin will see an $89 million reduction in food assistance benefits for its neediest citizens during the upcoming fiscal year. In response, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) has co-sponsored the “Extend Not Cut SNAP Benefits Act” to extend the modest increase in benefits for one year.

Due to these cuts, a family of four in Wisconsin could see a reduction of monthly benefits of up to $36, and the average benefit per person will drop to $1.40 for each meal.

“These cuts will make it even harder for more than 800,000 Wisconsinites to put food on the table and feed their families,” Pocan said. “While our economic growth remains tenuous, we cannot reduce support to our children, seniors and veterans who rely on these vital benefits. These types of cuts, just like the $40 billion food stamp cuts proposed by my House Republican colleagues, make millions of Americans more hungry while hurting our economy and further slowing our recovery. I urge my colleagues to join our efforts to preserve food assistance funding for those who need it most.”

SNAP funding is also a major issue of disagreement facing the Farm Bill Conference Committee that met for the first time this week. Pocan is vehemently opposed to the $40 billion in SNAP cuts proposed by House Republicans that would deny food assistance benefits for approximately 150,000 of Wisconsin’s poorest citizens.

To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $31.50 a week.###==
Title: Pocan Encourages Budget Conference Committee to Focus on Economic Growth & Job Creation

WASHINGTON, D.C.—As the Budget Conference Committee begins its negotiations today on a comprehensive budget plan, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today encouraged his colleagues to ensure their work focuses on the top problem facing our country: the need for further economic growth that will get the people of Wisconsin and America back to work.

It has been four years since Congress has passed a budget.

“The top priority of any budget plan should be helping to get the people of Wisconsin and this country back to work. As the CBO has reported, nearly three-fourths of our deficit in 2014 will be caused by unemployment and underemployment in our economy. The first step the committee should take to promote job creation is to end the indiscriminate sequester cuts that estimates show will cut 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin. The committee should also prioritize investments in areas that spur economic development—from education to infrastructure to innovative research.

“I also believe that where there is wasteful government spending, or programs that would benefit from reform, we should address those concerns. That includes wasteful tax breaks to corporations and special interests that add to our yearly deficits. Any balanced plan considered by the committee should include revenue options in addition to any potential cuts.

“However, I do not believe, and I will not support, any plan that tries to solve our country’s economic woes by cutting benefits to programs such as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid relied upon by our neediest citizens. We do not create jobs or grow our economy by denying seniors and the poorest Americans needed support.

“Democrats and Republicans must work together and do our jobs. That means our nation needs a national budget—a roadmap that lays out our priorities and guides our future.”

The Budget Conference Committee has until December 13thto finish its work.==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today announced that he has been selected to serve on the House Education & the Workforce Committee. The important committee has jurisdiction over education (early childhood, K-12, and higher education), job training programs, workforce protections, and employment-related benefits including healthcare and pensions. The appointment is effective immediately.

“The key to our nation’s economic prosperity lies in our robust support for education and our workforce, and I am honored to fight for these pressing priorities as a member of the Education & the Workforce Committee,”Pocan said.“From preserving access to a high quality college education, to strengthening job training programs, to protecting our workers, I will use my position on this important committee to advocate for the vital interests of our working families and students in south central Wisconsin.”

“The Education and Workforce Committee will be well-served by the talent of Congressman Mark Pocan,”said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.“A proven problem-solver with a staunch commitment to working families, he will continue to promote polices that create jobs, strengthen the middle class, and ensure a more prosperous future for all. From his constituents in Wisconsin to his colleagues in Washington, Congressman Pocan’s leadership is respected and valued.”

“I am very pleased to welcome Rep. Pocan to the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mark has been a strong advocate on behalf of working families and our nation’s students,”said Rep. George Miller, the Ranking Member and senior Democrat on the committee.“As a union member and owner of a union printing shop, Rep. Pocan will have unique insight into the struggles of workers who are fighting for a piece of the American Dream. I welcome Mark’s voice to the committee and his determination to grow and strengthen the nation’s middle class.”

Since arriving in Congress, Pocan, a union member and owner of a union specialty printing shop, has been a vigorous advocate for working families in Wisconsin and across the nation. He has supported an increase to the minimum wage, fought for a full NLRB board to enforce workplace laws, and backed increased funding for workplace and job training programs that prepare our workers for the jobs of today and the future. He has also taken a lead on the issue of college affordability, introducing legislation that would allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their federal student loans to the lowest current interest rate. Pocan also believes every student deserves to attend a safe school environment that is free from bullying and harassment, and earlier this year co-sponsored the bipartisan Student Non-Discrimination Act which would prohibit at the federal level discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity

Rep. Tom Petri (WI-06) is the only other member of the Wisconsin delegation to serve on the committee.###==
Title: Pocan Sponsors Bill to Rein in NSA Overreach & Protect Privacy Rights of Americans
Date: October 29, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today became an original co-sponsor of the bipartisan and bicameral USA FREEDOM Act that would rein in the National Security Agency’s (NSA) blanket surveillance policies and protect the privacy rights of all Americans. The legislation, which is sponsored in the House by fellow Wisconsinite and Patriot Act author Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05), would reform the Patriot Act by ensuring greater transparency and oversight over domestic surveillance programs and increasing the safeguards meant to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens.

“We fight a futile battle to protect our liberties from outside if we cannot protect them from within,” Pocan said. “While ensuring our national security must remain our top priority, Wisconsinites are rightfully concerned that the NSA’s overreach threaten their constitutional right to privacy. The USA FREEDOM Act takes important steps to reinstitute the proper balance between security and liberty, and I thank my Wisconsin colleague Congressman Sensenbrenner for his leadership on this effort.”

Earlier this year, Pocan voted for the Amash/Conyers amendment to the defense funding bill that would have restricted the NSA’s ability to use the Patriot Act to conduct blanket surveillance on Americans not under investigation.

A summary of the major provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act is below:

End bulk collection of Americans’ communications records

• The USA Freedom Act ends bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

• The bill would strengthen the prohibition on "reverse targeting" of Americans—that is, targeting a foreigner with the goal of obtaining communications involving an American.

• The bill requires the government to more aggressively filter and discard information about Americans accidentally collected through PRISM and related programs.

Reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court

• The USA Freedom Act creates an Office of the Special Advocate (OSA) tasked with promoting privacy interests before the FISA court’s closed proceedings. The OSA will have the authority to appeal decisions of the FISA court.

• The bill creates new and more robust reporting requirements to ensure that Congress is aware of actions by the FISC and intelligence community as a whole.

• The bill would grant the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board subpoena authority to investigate issues related to privacy and national security.

Increase Transparency

• The USA Freedom Act would end secret laws by requiring the Attorney General to publicly disclose all FISC decisions issued after July 10, 2003 that contain a significant construction or interpretation of law.

• Under the bill, Internet and telecom companies would be allowed to publicly report an estimate of (1) the number of FISA orders and national security letters received, (2) the number of such orders and letters complied with, and (3) the number of users or accounts on whom information was demanded under the orders and letters.

• The bill would require the government to make annual or semiannual public reports estimating the total number of individuals and U.S. persons that were subject to FISA orders authorizing electronic surveillance, pen/trap devices, and access to business records.

National Security Letters

• The USA Freedom Act adopts a single standard for Section 215 and NSL protection to ensure the Administration doesn’t use different authorities to support bulk collection. It also adds a sunset date to NSLs requiring that Congress reauthorize the government’s authority thereby ensuring proper congressional review.###==
Title: Pocan Votes to Reopen Government, Avoid Default

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today released the following statement after voting to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, thus avoiding a disastrous default by the United States. The government had been closed for 16 days.

“The adults in Congress have finally taken our government back, but not before we have done needless damage to our economy and the public’s faith in the democratic process. While I am pleased we have come to a pragmatic and bipartisan solution, we cannot continue to lurch from one manufactured crisis to another and wait until the last minute to act.

“The people of Wisconsin deserve a government that cares more about their needs than Washington-style political gain. Although we have avoided an economic calamity for now, Congress has failed to produce a budget for the past four years. We will not be able to take needed action on job growth, ending the indiscriminate sequester cuts, or protecting Social Security and Medicare for generations to come unless we make a concerted effort to work together and push the partisan gamesmanship aside.

“As we move forward on negotiations on a full-year budget, I am hopeful Congress learns from the lessons of this past month and puts country over ideology.”

Title: Pocan Highlights Devastating Wisconsin Impact of a Government Default
Date: October 15, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Just two days until the government reaches its borrowing limit and risks defaulting on its loans, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today highlighted the severe effects a government default would have on nearly every single Wisconsinite. While certain Republicans haverecently claimedthat breaching the country’s debt limit would have a minimal impact, a new report from the minority on the Ways and Means Committee confirms what most economists and financial leaders are saying: a default would be devastating to Wisconsin seniors, veterans, students, small businesses and middle class families. Pocan has joined many of his colleagues in calling for clean and long-term action on the debt limit that protects the stability of the U.S. economy.

Raising the debt limit does not authorize new spending; it simply allows the US Treasury to pay the bills we owe.

“This is a manufactured crisis with serious real-life consequences for nearly every Wisconsinite,” said Pocan, a member of the House Budget Committee. “If the stability of our economy and financial markets is threatened, Wisconsinites could see their hard-earned retirement savings lost, seniors and veterans could face delays in the monthly Social Security and disability checks they rely on, and the costs of homes and student loan rates could dramatically increase due to higher interest rates. Refusing to raise the debt limit would constitute nothing short of fiscal malpractice; House Republicans need to stop threatening the full faith and credit of the United States and start working with House Democrats and the Senate on protecting the economic security for all Americans.”

While more than 250,000 Wisconsin residents took out a home mortgage or refinanced their existing mortgage last year, the new analysis shows that mortgage rates could rise dramatically during a default, pushing up overall home loan costs. When Republicans threatened default in 2011, mortgage interest rate spreads increased by 0.7 percentage points. That same increase today would cost families an extra $100 a month, or $36,000 over the life of a typical 30-year home loan.

Retirement savings are expected to fall significantly, potentially costing the average person in Wisconsin a drop of $15,000 in 401(k) assets and almost $23,000 in IRA assets just as they did in July and August 2011, when Republicans pushed the U.S. to the brink of default. More than 1.1 million Social Security recipients here in Wisconsin may not get their monthly checks and 57,745 disabled veterans may not get their pensions as the Treasury Department is unable to borrow. Student loans will cost significantly more. And doctors and hospitals may not get paid for treating patients with Medicare.

Title: Pocan Signs Petition to Reopen Government
Date: October 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON – Twelve days into the GOP-induced government shutdown that has furloughed Wisconsin workers, threatened the food security of 113,000 Wisconsin women and children, and stalled business for Wisconsin companies, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) took action today to force a vote to reopen the government. Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition that would bypass Speaker Boehner and force the House to vote on a clean continuing resolution to fund the government, which has already been passed by the Senate andaccording to reportswould pass the House. Thus far Speaker Boehner has refused to allow a vote on the legislation, even though it would allow the government to reopen right now.

“We shouldn’t have to force a vote to reopen the government, but unfortunately the Tea Party-controlled Republicans continue to be more interested in stomping their feet and holding their breath than doing their jobs,” Pocan said. “Furloughed workers in Wisconsin and small business owners don’t have time to wait for Speaker Boehner to find the courage to stand up to the extreme wings of his party. We need to reopen the government, raise the debt ceiling and then sit down to negotiate a comprehensive, balanced and long-term budget. And we need to do it right now.”

A discharge petition requires the House to consider a piece of legislation once a majority of Members of Congress have signed it. Seven discharge petitions have received 218 signatures over the last 30 years.

Here are some of the ways the shutdown is hurting middle class families and small businesses in south central Wisconsin:

• The Wisconsin National Guard is unable to perform its monthly trainings, impacting both Guard readiness and the monthly incomes for Guard members (WEAU)
• The Small Business Administration (SBA) is not processing new loans—Last year, the SBA approved more than $83 million in loans in the second district (SBA)
• 85,000 Wisconsinites will lose their food stamps starting November 2ndif the federal government shutdown lasts till Oct. 17th; an additional 85,000 people will lose their benefits each subsequent day the government is shutdown (MJS)
• If the shutdown continues until the end of the month, the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC) that provides nutrition support for mothers and children will run out of money. About 113,000 Wisconsinites participate in the WIC program every month. (AP)
• The shutdown effects federal financial aid, funding for academic research and Veterans Administration benefits to student at UW-Madison and throughout the UW-System. UW-Madison has received more than a dozen stop-work orders from federal agencies such as the National Institutes for Health and National Park Service for work being done by about 90 UW-Madison employees for those agencies. (MJS)
• Approximately 15,000 federal employees work in Wisconsin; hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed across the country

Title: After Reviewing Draft Text, Pocan Expresses Strong Concerns with Trans-Pacific Partnership
Date: October 8, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—As the United States announced today it expects to complete work on a major new foreign trade agreement by the end of the year, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan today expressed continued concerns with the deal and encouraged Congress not to “fast track” the agreement for approval. Pocan recently reviewed sections of the bracketed draft text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement currently being negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries in the Pacific region, and believes the current language would put Wisconsin workers, jobs and local businesses at a disadvantage and ship American jobs overseas.

This summer,Pocan led a letterwith 35 other freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.

“In Wisconsin we’ve already suffered through the effects of massive trade deals that shipped our jobs overseas and took “Made in America” products off our shelves. Unfortunately, this new trade agreement appears to be no better than deals of the past, and from what I can tell, may even be worse,” said Pocan. “Beyond putting Wisconsin workers and local businesses at a disadvantage, the agreement as it stands now would likely do nothing to prevent the grave labor and environmental abuses currently perpetuated by many of our trade “friends.” While administration officials may be determined to complete negotiations by the end of the year, Congress is obligated not to rush its Constitutional-oversight without addressing provisions that could have lasting consequences for our economy.”

The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to oversee all international trade agreements. But if recent precedent is followed, the TPP would likely reach the House floor with limited opportunities for Congress to offer input, and without the ability for Congress to amend the text.

After Pocan reviewed specific sections of the agreement focused on procurement and labor, he had particular concerns regarding:

• The protection of Buy American and other procurement policies
• The ability to prevent harmful labor practices abroad
• The enforcement of environmental protections
• How participating nations could address humanitarian concerns
• The determination of how jurisdictions, both in the U.S. and abroad, would be subject to the agreement

“Some of the countries that are currently negotiating the TPP with the United States have atrocious labor practices,” Pocan said. “In order to bring these nations into the agreement, we will likely have to lower our standards, not raise them, and make it even harder to keep jobs in our country.”

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Pocan led the passage of the American Jobs Act, which required all state contracts be performed in the United States.###==

WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after the government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on October 1, 2013.

“This is a sad day for the American people, and our American democracy. Instead of working together to fulfill our most basic duty—to keep the government running—the extreme Tea Party wing has taken Congress hostage all the way to a government shutdown. Instead of being the world’s greatest example of representative government, we seem to have become the nation’s largest kindergarten—only with control of the nation’s checkbook and nuclear arsenal.

“It’s time for the adults in the Republican party to take the keys back from the Tea Party and stand up to those who would rather see our government shut down than allow expanded health care access in America. I am committed to doing all that I can to come to a commonsense resolution as quickly as possible, but I refuse to be held hostage by extremist demands.”

Title: Pocan on New HHS Report Announcing Increased Choice and Low Rates for Wisconsinites with Affordable Care Act
Date: September 25, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Looking for multiple options and low health care costs? According to a new report released today from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), that’s exactly what Wisconsinites will get in the Health Insurance Marketplace that was established by the Affordable Care Act. According to the report, Wisconsin consumers will be able to choose from an average of 97 health plans in the Marketplace. A 27-year old in Wisconsin making $25,000 a year will pay as low as $96 per month for health care after tax credits, while a family of four with an income of $50,000 per year could pay as low as $106 per month with tax credits.

Starting on October 1, Wisconsinites have six months to enroll for health care through the Marketplace. Consumers can find out whether they qualify for premium assistance and compare plans side-by-side based on pricing, quality and benefits. You cannot be denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition.

“The Affordable Care Act is doing exactly what it is supposed to do—provide the people of Wisconsin with health and economic security through increased choice and low prices,” said Pocan. “Through the new law, thousands of Wisconsinites who had lacked access to affordable, quality health insurance now will be able to cover themselves and their families, even if they have a pre-existing condition. Unfortunately, Governor Walker and tea party Republicans in Washington would instead prefer to see this law fail to score political points. But no matter the stunts or obstructionist tactics they unleash, the Affordable Care Act is here to say, and that is a good thing for families all across Wisconsin.”

Nationally, premiums will be about 16 percent lower than originally expected. A majority of enrollees will have a choice between at least two different health insurance companies.

Plans in the Marketplace will be categorized as either “gold,” “silver,” or “bronze.” Young adults will also have the option of purchasing a “catastrophic” plan, increasing their number of choices. In Wisconsin, the average premium for the lowest-cost silver plan will be $344 and for the lowest cost bronze plan will be $287. Both of those numbers are before tax credits. The full report from HHS is available here:https://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2013/MarketplacePremiums/ib_marketplace_premiums.cfm

Title: Pocan on Tea Party Bill That Moves Government Closer to Shut Down
Date: September 20, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today voted against a funding bill that caters to the Tea Party wing of the Republican party and moves the government closer to a shut down. The continuing resolution, or CR, the House considered today would keep in place the sequester cuts that will cost the nation more than one million jobs by the end of 2014 and attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act for a 42ndfailed time. As even many Republican Senators have indicated, including a measure to put control of health care back in the hands of the insurance companies is impossible, impractical, and threatens to shut down the government.

“This is not an issue of Democrats against Republicans—this is an issue of responsible adults against extremists that have decided to hold the government hostage unless we allow insurance companies to deny people coverage,” said Pocan. “Funding the government is the most basic responsibility of Congress, but the bill we voted on today only moves us closer to a tea-party instigated shutdown. I am hopeful that commonsense prevails and we can fulfill our obligations as a Congress and focus on putting people back to work and growing our economy.”

Title: Pocan Opposes $40 Billion Cuts that Would Kick 150,000 in Wisconsin off of Food Stamps
Date: September 19, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today will vote against Republican legislation that would deny food assistance benefits for approximately 150,000 of Wisconsin’s poorest citizens, including children, seniors and veterans. The legislation cuts nearly $40 billion from the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which offers a vital lifeline to Americans struggling to get back on their feet in this downturn economy. Ninety-two percent of people on SNAP are children, the elderly, disabled, or already working.

According to statistics from the Hunger Task Force, the bill woulddeny benefits to approximately 150,000 Wisconsinites,put 4,000 Wisconsin kids at risk of losing access to free/reduced meals, and result in theloss of an estimated $170 million to the Wisconsin economyjust next year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis earlier this week reporting that the legislation would kick nearly four million people nationally off the food stamp program.

“This extreme legislation forces more Wisconsinites into hunger while putting less money into our economy,” Pocan said. “The close to $40 billion worth of cuts would take food off the tables of 150,000 Wisconsinites struggling to support themselves and their families. If Republicans really want to shrink the food stamp program, they should focus on policies that will put people back to work, instead of bills that just leave more children, veterans and seniors hungry.”

The bill contains a number of provisions that ignore the reality that many Wisconsinites continue to struggle with the state’s unemployment rate at 6.8 percent. For example, the bill would end governors’ ability to waive SNAP’s harsh time limit for people looking for work in time of high unemployment, a waiver Wisconsin has requested the past ten years.

Earlier this week, Pocan sent a letter to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Douglas Elmendorf asking the CBO to include the impact of these cuts on economic growth and jobs. Estimates from the Center for American Progress indicate that these cuts would result in the loss of nearly 55,000 jobs just next year.

To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day ($31.50 a week) for seven days.==
Title: Pocan, Ros-Lehtinen, Connolly Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Ensure Equal Rights & Protections for all LGBT Federal Employees
Date: September 19, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON, D.C.—While the Supreme Court’s ruling inUnited States v. Windsorrepresented a landmark victory for equality and federal recognition of same sex marriages, discriminatory federal practices remain that leave employees in same-sex domestic partnerships without the rights and protections their heterosexual colleagues receive. In order to allow the federal government to compete for the best employees and ensure all of our nation’s civil servants have their loving relationships treated with respect and dignity, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Gerry Connolly (D-VA) today introduced the bipartisanDomestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act (DPBO).The legislation would grant federal employees in same sex domestic partnerships the same rights, protections and obligations afforded to heterosexual married couples.

U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today introduced the companion bill in the Senate.

“In a year of milestones for the equality movement, the federal government must continue to lead and ensure equal rights and benefits for all its civil servants,” said Pocan, a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “Passage of our bipartisan legislation will remove discriminatory practices that punish certain federal employees merely for whom they love and where they live. As the private sector has shown, policies that promote equality are not only the right thing to do, they also allow you to compete for the best and brightest employees.”

“It has been a banner year for equality for all Americans but the Federal government still has much work to do. This is why my colleagues and I will present this bipartisan bill to ensure that employees in same sex domestic partnerships have the same rights and protections as heterosexual couples,” said Ros-Lehtinen, original co-founder and member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “The Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act (DPBO) would achieve this and I’m honored to be an original co-sponsor of this common sense bill.”

“Our bipartisan legislation will strengthen our Nation’s civil service by ensuring LGBT Federal employees are treated with fairness and respect, and agencies are empowered to effectively recruit and retain a talented workforce,” said Connolly. “I often hear that the Federal Government should be run more like a business. Well, from Boeing to GE, America’s leading companies have spoken loud and clear in recognizing that no organization can remain competitive in terms of attracting and retaining great talent while discriminating against same-sex couples.”

According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), almost 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies and 19 State governments offer same-sex domestic partner benefits. The DPBO would empower federal agencies to compete with the private sector and state governments for the best and brightest employees.

Under the bill, federal employees would need to file an affidavit asserting they are in a same-sex domestic partnership and are not married. The bill only applies to federal employees working in states where marriage equality is not currently recognized. Among the rights, benefits and obligations that would be extended to same-sex domestic partnerships include retirement benefits, health and life insurance, and death benefits.###==
Title: Pocan Asks CBO for Economic Impact of Republican Cuts to Food Stamp Program

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—As House Republicans prepare to introduce legislation this week to cut nearly $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and deny vital food support for four to six million low-income Americans, U.S. Rep. Pocan (D-WI) wants to ensure his colleagues understand the full implications of these drastic funding reductions on American families and the American economy. In a letter to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Douglas Elmendorf, Pocan asks the CBO to include the impact of these cuts on economic growth and jobs in any analysis of the bill. Estimates from the Center for American Progress indicate that these cuts would result in the loss of nearly 55,000 jobs just next year.

SNAP provides an average of $4.50 of benefits per day to millions of Americans, including 800,000 Wisconsinites. According to Moody’s analytics, every $1 increase in SNAP benefits generates about $1.70 in economic activity

“Cuts to food assistance programs not only take food off the tables of our poorest families, children, seniors and veterans, they also cut vital spending in our local economies,” Pocan said. “If House Republicans cannot be moved to vote against a bill that would leave millions in America hungry, perhaps facts on the destructive effects this legislation would have on local businesses and workers will impact their thinking.”

Pocan was joined on the letter by Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), the ranking member on the Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, and Rep. James McGovern (D-MA), who has led the End Hunger Now campaign in Congress.

To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day ($31.50 a week) for seven days.

Dear Director Elmendorf,

The House Majority is introducing a bill intended to serve as a substitute for the missing nutrition title of H.R. 2642, the Federal Agricultural Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (FARRM.). Media reports state that the bill will include $40 billion worth of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Assuming that this is the case, we have a number of concerns we would like you to address when analyzing the legislation.

The Congressional Budget Office has released several economic analyses since the start of the economic downturn that have pointed out the relatively high multiplier effects of the SNAP program as a countercyclical economic stabilizer. The necessary corollary is that reductions in SNAP benefits could have a greater impact in setting back our recovery than other policies that achieve equivalent levels of deficit reduction. Given these potential consequences, we want to be sure that the full economic impact of the proposed cuts is taken into account when the bill is debated. Consequently, we ask that you include in any CBO analysis of this legislation an estimate of the changes in economic output and employment that can be expected to result from these SNAP cuts.

In addition, we ask that you include in your analysis estimates of the impact of these cuts on beneficiaries, i.e. the extent to which individuals and families will see their benefits reduced and how many individuals would lose their benefits altogether.

Having CBO-verified information on this subject would help Congress to fully understand the impact of this bill. Thank you for your attention to this request.

Sincerely,

Mark Pocan Steny HoyerMember of Congress Member of Congress

Title: Pocan Announces $400,000 Grant to Disability Rights Wisconsin to Address Domestic Abuse and Sexual Assault of People with Disabilities
Date: September 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) announced today that Madison-based Disability Rights Wisconsin has been awarded a $400,000 grant to address domestic abuse and sexual assault of people with disabilities. The Department of Justice issued the grant through theViolence Against Women Act’s (VAWA) Disability Grant Program. The Wisconsin Project is the only project nationally to be awarded funds since the inception of the federal Disabilities Grant Program.

Pocan is a staunch supporter of VAWA, and earlier this year fought for an expanded and inclusive reauthorization of the landmark legislation that was signed into law by President Obama.

“All individuals who are the victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse deserve access to support services and full protection under the law,” said Pocan. “I thank Disability Rights Wisconsin for their work to ensure people with disabilities who have been subject to these crimes have a safe place to go to address their needs. This grant will ensure they can continue their important work for our disability and Deaf community in Wisconsin.”

Individuals with disabilities face increased incidents of domestic abuse and sexual assault, but often times face gaps in services. Disability Rights Wisconsin will work with End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin (formerly the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence) and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault on this project to help establish collaborative and multi-disciplinary teams that can enhance the services and support available for persons with disabilities and Deaf who are victims of violence.

“Disability Rights Wisconsin, End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin and Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault are honored to have been awarded funds through the Office on Violence Against Women to continue the vital work of Wisconsin’s decade-long Violence Against Women with Disabilities and Deaf Women Project,” said Amy Judy, Project Coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin. “Our Project strives to ensure that Wisconsinites with disabilities and Deaf who have experienced sexual assault or domestic abuse will be supported by people and systems that reflect person-centered, safe and accessible responses. Disability Rights Wisconsin is grateful for Congressman Pocan’s unwavering support of the Violence Against Women Act and its 2013 reauthorization which made this Disability Grant Program and the award possible.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.--U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after President Obama's speech to the nation on the situation in Syria. Pocan had previously said he would oppose the President's request for an authorization to conduct a military strike in Syria.

“The reprehensible use of chemical weapons is a global problem, and it deserves global action. I am pleased that, as many of my colleagues and I have advocated, the United States has joined the international community in working together on a response to the situation in Syria that will avoid a military strike and achieve the necessary goal of removing chemical weapons from the hands of the Syrian government. I will continue to carefully monitor the progress of any agreement, and I am hopeful that we come to a resolution that demonstrates the power of a united global response.”

Title: Pocan Introduces Legislation to Let Students Refinance Their College Loans
Date: September 5, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—As students across south central Wisconsin arrive on campus for a new school year, they return with a higher likelihood than ever before of graduating tens of thousands of dollars in debt. In response to the student debt crisis that is pricing students out of a college education and crippling our economy, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced student loan refinancing legislation on the UW-Madison campus to help make college more affordable. Pocan’s bill, H.R. 3047, would allow anyone with a federal student loan to refinance so they are paying the lowest interest rate available for their respective loans.

“Instead of relying on college graduates to bankroll Washington’s needs, the federal government should be doing all that it can to make a college education as affordable and accessible as possible,” Pocan said. “Two-thirds of Americans now leave college drowning in debt, unable to achieve their dreams or contribute to the economy in a meaningful way. My bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like you can refinance a house or car loan, freeing up funds to buy a house, get a new car, support a family, and pursue greater economic opportunities.”

Today, 83 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion in total student debt in this country is from federal student loans, but students face limited options to refinance their federal loans once they have graduated from college. Pocan’s legislation would remove the current restrictions, allowing anyone with a subsidized or unsubsidized federal Stafford loan, or a federal direct PLUS loan, to refinance their interest rate whenever the borrowing rates are reduced.

According to the New York Federal Reserve, total student debt has tripled over the past eight years, and now exceeds all credit card debt in this country. The average student debt held by the class of 2011 in Wisconsin is more than $26,000, with 67 percent of students graduating in debt. A study from One Wisconsin Now found it will take Wisconsinites, on average, almost 19 years to pay off their student loan debt from a four-year university. Money used to pay off the high interest rates on student loans is money that instead could be spent on major purchases such as a home or a new car.

“A strong economy demands an educated workforce and a robust middle class, and students are taking responsibility for paying for their education and job training,” said One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross. “Congressman Pocan's plans to help hardworking borrowers get a fair shot at the middle class instead of a multi-decade student loan debt sentence are the kind of common sense solutions we need to fix the trillion dollar student loan debt crisis.”

H.R.3047 has been referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.###==

WASHINGTON, DC—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after he returned to Washington, D.C., for today’s classified briefing for members of Congress on the situation in Syria:

“A strong discussion occurred today, however I am still not convinced that there is a compelling national security interest that necessitates a military response, solely or largely born by the United States. We need to engage the international community to find the appropriate response to the use of chemical weapons, and to do so will require a much broader discussion with all proper options given full consideration. The use of chemical weapons is completely unacceptable, but this is an issue that is best addressed by the international community. I look forward to reviewing the United Nations report as we move forward in this discussion.”

Title: Pocan Applauds Department of Treasury’s Decision to Recognize all Same-Sex Marriages
Date: August 29, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today applauded the decision by the U.S. Department of Treasury to recognize all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of whether or not they live in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. The ruling means that married same-sex couples, including Pocan and his husband Phil, who were married in Canada in 2006, can now receive all federal marriage-based tax benefits, including employee benefits, child tax credits, and gift and estate taxes.

“I applaud the Department of Treasury for siding with equality and treating all legally married couples in America the same,” said Pocan. “Loving same-sex couples should not be afraid they could lose their federal benefits or protections simply by moving to another state. Today’s decision continues our nation’s forceful progress toward recognizing the rights and responsibilities of all loving couples.”

The decision follows the Supreme Court’s ruling in June that struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and required the federal government to recognize married same-sex couples in states that recognize same-sex marriage. Today’s decision expands on the ruling and recognizes all couples married in jurisdictions that recognize marriage equality.==

MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria and the rumors of a military strike by the United States:

“The use of chemical weapons is a reprehensible action. However, before any military action is taken by the United States, Congress should have a robust and thorough debate on the nation’s appropriate response. Any decision to engage in a military response must be done in consultation with and approval of Congress.

“I strongly urge the President to call Congress into session if he is serious about a military response to the civil war in Syria. While those who use chemical weapons must be held accountable, we too must be accountable to the Constitution and the laws of the land.”

Pocan also today sent a letter to the President, authored by California Congresswoman Barbara Lee, condemning the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria and calling for full congressional debate on an appropriate response.###==

MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the 50thanniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which featured Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivering his historic “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

“As we mark the 50thanniversary of the historic March on Washington, we recognize the tremendous progress our nation has made, both in the halls of our legislatures and in the hearts of our people. But the efforts to live up to Dr. King’s call to “make real the promises of democracy” continue. While the March on Washington is largely credited with inspiring the passage of the landmark Voting Right Act of 1965, we now face renewed threats to our fundamental right to vote. We do a disservice to the memories of Dr. King and Bayard Rustin if we do not protect against forces wishing to promote the rights of certain citizens while limiting those of others.

“That is why I have introduced an amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrining the right to vote. Passage of this amendment will mean that no matter who you are, where you live, or where you come from, every American would have the right to vote, and the ability to protect their individual rights and freedoms. Any less is a disservice to the legacy of the March on Washington.”

Title: Pocan Urges Speaker Boehner Not to Leave More Americans Hungry
Date: August 14, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) is urging Speaker Jon Boehner not to leave more Americans hungry by cutting food assistance programs that benefit 800,000 Wisconsinites. In a letter with 204 other House Democrats, Pocan implored the Speaker to include funding for nutrition programs in any future Farm Bill that comes before the House of Representatives.

“As a Congress, we should be doing all that we can to decrease hunger in America and tackle a crisis that affects millions of children and seniors each and every day. Unfortunately, thus far the Republican leadership has only moved on bills that would take food away from people who need it the most,” said Pocan. “A Farm Bill without funding for vital nutrition assistance programs is not a Farm Bill that is good for America. I urge Speaker Boehner and my colleagues across the aisle to come together with Democrats and do all that we can to ensure Americans don’t go to bed hungry.”

In a dangerous break with tradition, this year’s Farm Bill pushed by the House Republican leadership did not include funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food stamp program that benefits 47 million Americans. Recent reports indicate that Republicans are instead planning to introduce legislation that would slash SNAP funding by $40 billion, kicking millions of Americans off the program.

“The Republican leadership recently forced through a Farm Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2642, which did not include the nutrition title, a major part of the Farm Bill that would reauthorize SNAP,” the members wrote. “We voted against this bill in large part because of this intentional omission. We strongly believe in the critical importance of SNAP. Given the essential nature of this program to millions of American families, the final language of the Farm Bill or any other legislation related to SNAP must be crafted to ensure that we do not increase hunger in America.”

To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day for one week.

The full letter is as follows:

August 13, 2013

The Honorable John Boehner

The Speaker

H-232, The Capitol

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Speaker Boehner,

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is our country’s most critical anti-hunger program, helping more than 47 million Americans meet their basic food needs at a time when more than 50 million Americans face the threat of food insecurity. Nearly half of SNAP enrollees are children, and the program helps feed roughly one in three children in America. Additionally, almost 75 percent of SNAP participants are in households with children, seniors, or a disabled individual.

More than half of the average household’s SNAP allocation is used within 7 days, and by the third week of the month 90 percent of SNAP benefits have been redeemed, leaving many families without the resources they need to buy food. This inadequacy causes an added burden on food banks, as nearly 60 percent of the households receiving SNAP and using food banks have to rely on food banks at least 6 months a year. In addition, under current law each household participating in SNAP will see a benefit reduction when the temporary increase from the Recovery Act expires. This means that, beginning November 1st, each SNAP enrollee will see a cut to their benefit that is, on average, less than $1.50 per meal.

Unfortunately, the Republican leadership recently forced through a Farm Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2642, which did not include the nutrition title, a major part of the Farm Bill that would reauthorize SNAP. We voted against this bill in large part because of this intentional omission. We strongly believe in the critical importance of SNAP. Given the essential nature of this program to millions of American families, the final language of the Farm Bill or any other legislation related to SNAP must be crafted to ensure that we do not increase hunger in America.==
Title: Pocan on 40th Vote to Repeal Health Care Reform: Simply Unacceptable

PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—On the final day before Congress leaves Washington for five weeks, House members will not vote on legislation that would help create jobs, jumpstart the economy, or support middle class families. Instead, Republican leadership has brought to the floor for the 40thtime, and the second time in two weeks, a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and leave more than 50,000 people in the second district at risk of being denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the Republicans’ misplaced priorities and the need to concentrate on jobs:

“Eighty-six percent of Americans want Congress to focus on job creation, but Republican leadership would rather focus on a 40thvote for a bill they know will never become law. At a time when nearly 12 million Americans are out of work, and the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is at 6.8%, Republican leadership continues to hold this body hostage to their extreme right wing factions. This is simply unacceptable. Instead of pursing partisan bills for partisan purposes, the GOP should listen to the American people, work with Democrats, and help get the American people back to work.”

In the 212 days since the start of the 113th Congress, Republicans have failed to pass a single jobs bill.###==
Title: Mark Pocan and Gwen Moore Introduce Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act
Date: August 1, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-2) and Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-4) introduced legislation supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) runaway and homeless youth.

The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA), last reauthorized in 2008 as the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act, is up for reauthorization this year. Currently, the legislation omits language relating to LGBT youth. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act (RHYIA) would help ensure that LGBT youth are not discriminated against and that grant recipients have the cultural competency to effectively serve these youth. In addition, RHYIA would take important steps to provide family support services for those struggling with the sexual orientation or gender identity of youth in their families.

“I ran away from home when I was an adolescent,” saidRep. Moore. “It was the first and last time. Living on the streets is a difficult and dangerous experience – one that no child should have to endure. Unfortunately, homelessness is the reality for hundreds of thousands of youth each year. According to some studies, LGBT youth account for up to 40 percent of all homeless youth. LGBT homelessness is an issue that negatively impacts our children, our families and our communities. Omitting these young people from the RHYA sends a powerful message to this population: that addressing their trauma and fear is not a priority. The LGBT youth homelessness experience cannot be ignored.”

LGBT youth are disproportionately represented in youth homelessness statistics. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act would require the Family and Youth Service Bureau to compile comprehensive data on the pervasiveness of LGBT youth homelessness.

“Homelessness is one of the most pressing matters affecting LGBT youth,”Rep. Pocansaid. “Young people in the LGBT community are disproportionately at-risk for homelessness, often as a result of the rejection, discrimination, or violence they face simply for being themselves. We have a moral responsibility to ensure that all of our youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, have access to life-saving services and safe, welcoming places to stay. By passing the reauthorization of an inclusive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, we can begin to address this tragic problem and provide needed support to all of our young people in times of need.”

“No young person should ever be homeless, let alone because they are gay or transgender, but when they are, we need to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect when they seek help,” saidCyndi Lauper, Co-Founder of the True Colors Fund, which works to raise awareness about and help bring an end to LGBT youth homelessness. “I applaud Representatives Moore and Pocan for championing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act. Every young person, no matter who they are, deserves an even break and should never be turned away. If we want a strong future, we need to invest in all of our youth.”

Representatives Moore and Pocan extend their thanks to current supporters of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act, including the following:Pathfinders, theTrue Colors Fundand theNational Network 4 Youth.==
Title: Pocan Statement on Student Loan Vote
Date: July 31, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after voting against a bill that would cap student loan interest rates at 8.25%, higher than the current unsustainable cap of 6.8%, and almost five points higher than the 3.4% cap that was in place before July 1st.

“The college affordability crisis currently ravaging our students and our country’s future economic prosperity requires a long-term solution that preserves the dream of a college diploma for our nation’s young people. The bill we voted on today is unfortunately not that solution. While the legislation provides immediate relief to students over the next few years, it has the potential to exacerbate the problem in the time to follow and increase student loan rates even higher than their current excessive rate.

“The government should not be in the business of profiting off students. We need to focus on commonsense ideas—such as allowing student loan holders to refinance their student loans--that make college as affordable as possible. As the representative for nearly 60,000 college students in south central Wisconsin, I will continue to fight to ensure every young person in Wisconsin can access a quality higher education without the fear of sky-high college costs or unbearable college debt.”

Pocan co-sponsored legislation, with 171 co-sponsors, in the House that would have frozen student loan interest rates for federally subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 percent for two years.==

Title: Pocan & Rangel Introduce Bipartisan Restore Honor to Service Members Act for Gay Veterans Discharged due to Sexual Orientation
Date: July 25, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON— U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charlie Rangel (D-NY) today introduced legislation, along with 100 bipartisan cosponsors, to ensure that gay and lesbian veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation receive the honor and recognition they deserve. The "Restore Honor to Service Members Act" would instill the repeal of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" into law and support the Department of Defense's efforts to correct the unfairly tarnished military records of our brave service members. Since World War II to the repeal of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation."For too long, tens of thousands of men and women who selflessly risked their lives for our country have lived with the dishonorable records that came from the unjust "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy," said Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. "But the support we have received for our legislation demonstrates the country's strong desire to close the book on "Don't Ask Don't Tell" and rightfully recognize the service of all of our courageous service members. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move forward with this effort and restore honor to all of our brave veterans.""As an American, a Congressman, and a Korean War Veteran, I was proud to join my colleagues in ending the discriminatory law that previously barred open gay and lesbian soldiers from serving their country," said Rangel. "Now is the time to finish the job and ensure that all those who served honorably are recognized for their Honorable service regardless of their sexual orientation."

The "Restore Honor to Service Members Act" is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the characterization of the discharges varied, many members received discharges that were classified as "other than honorable" or "dishonorable," particularly prior to the implementation of the "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy in 1993. In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a "general discharge," a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries.

The "Restore Honor to Service Members Act," turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable. It also removes any indication of a service member's sexual orientation from the record, so they are not automatically "outed" to those accessing their record and protects against future discrimination by decriminalizing consensual relations between same sex couples, bringing military law in line with Supreme Court rulings.

Statements of Support for the Restore Honor to Service Members Act:"American Veterans For Equal Rights (AVER) wholeheartedly endorses and supports the Restore Honor to Service Members Act,"said Danny Ingram,

President, American Veterans for Equal Rights."Many thousands of LGBT service members were dishonorably discharged from WWII to 1994, prior to DADT, and thousands more under the DADT policy. Many elderly veterans urgently need access to the VA care which they are currently denied due to their discharges for being gay. The current process of discharge upgrades is extremely cumbersome and bureaucratic and can take over a decade in many cases. ""The repeal of ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was a tremendous first step in achieving equality in our nation's Armed Forces. It is important that we continue to address the discrimination that LGBT veterans face by updating their service records to reflect the reality of their service"said HRC Legislative Director Allison Herwitt."We are thankful that Reps. Pocan (D-WI) and Rangel (D-NY) have addressed this issue with the "Restore Honor to Service Members Act.'""The September 2011 repeal of 'Don't ask, don't tell' created a brighter future for our LGBT service members, allowing them to serve openly without fear of harsh professional repercussions. But this victory for LGBT service members' future cannot undo the injuries of the past. Now, SWAN thanks U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan and Charlie Rangel for seeking to do just that, "said Anu Bhagwati, Service Women's Action Network executive director and former Marine Corps captain."The 'Restore Honor to Service Members Act' closes the loop on this discriminatory policy: wiping out dishonorable characterizations tied to sexual orientation and restoring honor to those from whom it was unjustly taken.""At OutServe-SLDN, we hear from these veterans every day and have assisted hundreds of them in applying to upgrade their discharge paperwork. The process is arduous and slow. There is no reason someone who courageously served or fought for their country yet is wrongfully discharged for being gay, should have to fight once again to have their service deemed 'honorable.' To the extent that this bill — or any bill — can expedite that process or ease the burden for veterans, it will have our support,"said Zeke Stokes of OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy group for gay military personnel.###==

WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement after voting to restrict the National Security Agency’s (NSA) ability to use the Patriot Act to conduct blanket surveillance on Americans not under investigation. The bipartisan measure was introduced as an amendment to the defense funding bill under consideration by the House this week.

“The NSA’s invasive, but unfortunately legal, surveillance tactics are the exact type of government overreach Russ Feingold warned of when the Patriot Act was passed into law,” said Pocan. “While Americans understand that sacrifices must sometimes be made in the name of national security, it is against our country’s principles to unreasonably and excessively infringe on the right to privacy. Allowing the NSA to continue to freely conduct blanket surveillance measures creates an environment where any of our liberties could be up for grabs if the executive branch deems it appropriate. It is past time Congress put an end to these intrusive and secret practices, and I will continue to fight to ensure we can once again restore the necessary balance between privacy and security.”

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense funding bill to make key investments in clean energy technologies that are critical to current and future military missions. Pocan’s efforts would support research and development to improve the safety of advanced batteries, and specifically lithium ion batteries, required for many of the Navy’s new capabilities. Lithium ion batteries, which contain no toxic chemicals, have up to three times the performance capabilities of other battery products.

After securing commitments from committee leadership on the House floor to continue to work on ways to support these vital new technologies, Pocan withdrew his provision.

“Investing in clean energy technologies is good environmental policy, good economic policy, and good national security policy,” Pocan said. “Advanced batteries such as those used by the Navy are not only more efficient and powerful, they also produce high quality American jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and improve our abilities to respond to emerging threats,” Pocan said. “By supporting further research into these new advancements, we can ensure these technologies are as safe and effective as possible.”

Many of the Navy’s newest systems require the type of increased energy capacities that lithium ion batteries provide. But current lithium-ion batteries can cause violent fires with extreme smoke and high temperatures that are potentially catastrophic, especially on ships. While scientists have advanced new technologies that can greatly increase the safety of these batteries, they require additional research, development and testing. Pocan’s provision would provide the necessary support to promote the development of more effective and safe advanced batteries.==
Title: Déjà vu: Pocan Adds 38th Action House Should Take Instead of Voting on 38th ACA Repeal
Date: July 17, 2013

Washington– Just two months after the House’s last vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the chamber will once again waste time that could be spent on creating jobs and supporting middle class families byvoting today for the 38thtimeto roll back health care security for millions of Americans.

In response, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) has added one more item to his list of actions the House could take up instead of these partisan and futile efforts:Fully fund SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program),which provides a vital lifeline to 800,000 Wisconsinites and more than 20 million hungry children nationwide. Last week, House Republicans pushed through a partisan and incomplete Farm Bill that went against precedent and separated nutrition assistance funding from the agricultural provisions of the bill, putting the food stamp program at risk.

“It’s been just two months, but we are once again wasting time on the obstructionist partisan objectives of the House Republican leadership that could be spent on creating jobs, tackling the college affordability crisis, passing a budget, or providing vital food assistance to 800,000 Wisconsinites. Unless leadership can get its priorities in order, this Congress will continue to be seen as the most ineffectual in history. I’ve said it before and I will say it again—the people of Wisconsin deserve better.”

Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites in the Second District are already benefitting from the ACA. Approximately 229,000 individuals—including 46,000 children and 93,000 women—now have health insurance that covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductible. For more info on how the ACA is impacting south central Wisconsin, clickhere.

Below is a list of 38 bills and action items the House should be working on instead of a 38thvote to repeal the Affordable Care Act:

1. Eliminate the Sequester
2. Appoint Budget Conferees to Pass National Budget
3. Keep Student Loan Interest Rates from Doubling
4. Paycheck Fairness Act
5. Mandatory Background Checks for Gun Purchases
6. Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform
7. DISCLOSE Act – requires disclosure of political expenditures by corporations and lobbying groups
8. BE SAFE Act – Strengthens Military Sexual Assault Enforcement
9. Address the Veterans Affairs Claims Backlog
10. Put America Back to Work Now Act
11. Pass Comprehensive Farm Bill
12. Invest in American Jobs – Strengthen Buy American Requirements for Investments in Infrastructure Projects
13. Employment Non-Discrimination Act –Prohibits employment discrimination based on perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity
14. Paying a Fair Share Act –Codifies the Buffett Rule, requiring a 30% minimum effective tax rate for taxpayers with incomes over $1 million
15. Reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)
16. Reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA)
17. Building our Clean Energy Future Now Act –provides grants for public transportation projects to reduce emissions without raising prices or cutting services.
18. Small Business Paperwork Relief Act
19. Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act– Allows same-sex partners of military couples the same benefits as heterosexual partners
20. Student Non-Discrimination Act –Prohibits discrimination or bullying of students based on perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity
21. Fair Minimum Wage Act
22. Postal Service Protection Act
23. Make it in America Manufacturing Act of 2013 --Provides competitive grants for public-private partnerships to promote American manufacturing.
24. Increases benefits to Veterans to keep up with cost-of-living changes

Title: Pocan Applauds Bipartisan Senate Committee Vote on ENDA
Date: July 10, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today applauded the bipartisan 15-7 vote of a fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) today. ENDA has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and is a priority for Pocan and the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus.

Despite significant progress for LGBT people and families in recent years there is still no explicit federal law that protects LGBT individuals from employment discrimination; ENDA would extend federal employment discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Currently only 17 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while an additional four prohibit employment discrimination based only on sexual orientation. As a result, LGBT people face serious discrimination in employment, including being fired, being denied a promotion and experiencing harassment on the job.

“As we have already seen this summer, the momentum toward full equality for all citizens is at full steam, and the Senate HELP committee’s bipartisan passage of ENDA only furthers this progress,” said Pocan. “No one should ever face discrimination in the workplace because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and this commonsense legislation will ensure all of our workers, no matter the state where they reside or who they choose to love, can feel safe in the work environment.”

Title: Pocan Calls on Sen. McConnell to Stop Denying Justice to Workers
Date: July 9, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—In another transparent attempt to weaken the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and deny 80 million private sector workers, both union and non-union, the protection they are guaranteed under law, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow votes on President Obama’s nominees to the Board. Without a fully-functioning NLRB, hardworking Americans will have no recourse when their rights are violated, creating uncertainty for both workers and businesses. In response, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) has joined more than 200 of his colleagues in a letter to McConnell, urging him to stop the obstructionist tactics and allow the Senate to vote on the president’s NLRB nominees.

“The Republican attacks on the NLRB prevent the agency from performing its duties and leave workers and employers without the protections they need and deserve,” Pocan said. “As employees continue to wait for their cases to be addressed and for justice to be served, their livelihoods and their ability to provide for their families remain at risk. Senator McConnell needs to stop his partisan obstructionism and backdoor attacks to rewrite our nation’s labor laws and allow a vote on the President’s NLRB nominees without delay.”

Earlier this year, President Obama nominated five individuals to the Board, all of whom continue to wait for votes by the full Senate. If the Senate does not act, come August 27ththe five-member NLRB will only have two sitting members, one short of the legal minimum needed to conduct its work. This would be a disaster for workers and employers all across the country, as there would be no federal agency left to enforce labor laws for private-sector employers. Already, because of a recent decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that brought into question the ability of President Obama to make recess appointments to the Board, businesses are challenging NLRB decisions in unprecedented numbers—already there have been 600 challenges to Board decisions involving Obama’s recess appointees, Ms. Sharon Block and Mr. Richard Griffin.

McConnell has stated that he will not allow votes on NLRB nominees unless Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin are replaced.

“Demanding the resignation of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is counterproductive and ignores both legal process and precedent,” the members wrote to McConnell. “Each day that the Board sits idle is one in which workers’ lawful rights are put at risk. We urge you to withdraw this partisan demand and allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to consider presidential appointments, and to do so without continued delay.”

The full text of the letter is below:

July 9, 2013

Senator Mitch McConnell

317 Russell Senate Office Building

Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator McConnell:

We are writing to express our serious concern over recent press reports detailing your position regarding the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Specifically, your office stated that the Senate will not vote on the full package of Board nominees unless current Board members Ms. Sharon Block and Mr. Richard Griffin are replaced. This is nothing more than a blatant and cynical attempt to shut down the NLRB’s lawful ability to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices.

As you are well aware, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit),Noel Canning v. NLRB, decision to invalidate the President Obama’s recess appointments of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is not the final legal say on the matter. Therefore, their current nominations should not be disqualified. The President has asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and there is pending litigation in at least five other district courts. Demanding the resignation of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is counterproductive and ignores both legal process and precedent.

At the moment, only three members are sitting on the NLRB, with one member’s term due to expire in August. As a result, the Board is at risk of being unable to function. Furthermore, employers are already using theNoel Canningdecision to challenge the NLRB’s decisions and the DC Circuit Court is putting these cases on hold, leaving workers without remedy when they are illegally fired or when their employer refuses to negotiate in good faith.

These delays and the uncertainty that they cause have real world consequences for American workers. For example, Marcus Hedger from Illinois has lost his family home while waiting for a final decision on his illegal firing. In September 2012 a unanimous bipartisan panel of the NLRB determined in that Mr. Hedger was terminated as a result of union activity and ordered that he be reinstated with back pay. However, the company appealed that decision to the DC Circuit Court. In January, the case was delayed due to theNoel Canningdecision, leaving Mr. Hedger without any remedy. It has been several years since the situation began and he still is struggling for justice.

The NLRB provides critical protections to American workers and gives businesses much needed labor certainty. Each day that the Board sits idle is one in which workers’ lawful rights are put at risk. This continued ideological obstructionism is denying hardworking Americans the crucial worker protections that the NLRB provides. We urge you to withdraw this partisan demand and allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to consider presidential appointments, and to do so without continued delay.###==
Title: Pocan Calls on GOP Leadership to Bring Up Vote to Freeze Student Loan Rates for 160,000 Wisconsin Students
Date: July 8, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—One week after student loan rates doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent for nearly 160,000 Wisconsin students, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) once again urged GOP leadership to stop balancing the budget on the backs of students and bring up a vote to freeze student loan rates. Last month, Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up for a vote the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, which would freeze the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years.

Today, every Democrat in the Wisconsin State Assembly sent a letter to the Wisconsin Congressional delegation urging Congress to roll back the interest rates.

“Our education leaders, our students and parents, and now our local representatives in Wisconsin are all in unison: stop the student loan rates from doubling,” Pocan said. “Unfortunately, these calls seem to be falling on the deaf ears of the House Republican leadership, which has thus far only offered a “solution” that would end up costing students even more than if these loan rates stay at the doubled cost. A quality, accessible college education is too important to our country’s long-term economic vitality to fall victim to partisan inaction. Wisconsinites are known for their commonsense, and I am ready to work with our delegation and the entire Congress to fight to avert these unnecessary and harmful measures.”

While Pocan and his Democratic colleagues are seeking to freeze student loan interest rates, House Republicans pushed through a bill in May that would tie the interest rate to the 10-year Treasury note (T-Note), leaving the cost of students' college education in the hands of Wall Street. In fact, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the projected rate by the time incoming freshman start re-paying their loans four years later would be 7.4 percent--higher than if Congress leaves the rates at 6.8 percent. At the end of the day, the GOP plan would mean more than 7 million low–and middle-income students would have to pay more for their student loans, and would increase student loan debt by almost $4 billion over the next decade.

The drastically increasing student loan debt held by Americans across the country can be considered nothing less than a crisis. Total student debt has tripled over the past eight years and now tops $1 trillion, exceeding all credit card debt in this country. The average student debt held by the class of 2011 in the United States is more than $26,000. And according to a study from One Wisconsin, it will take Wisconsinites on average almost 19 years to pay off their student loan debt from a four-year university, taking away money that could be spent in our local economies.==

Title: Pocan Lauds Supreme Court’s Decision to Recognize Love & Equality and Strike Down DOMA
Date: June 26, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and the only current married gay member of Congress, today issued the following statement in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and to dismiss the Prop 8 case on a lack of standing. As a result of today’s rulings, married same-sex couples in the states that recognize same-sex marriage will now also be recognized by the federal government and have access to federal rights, obligations and protections. However, because Pocan lives in Wisconsin, a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage, his marriage will not be affected by the Court’s ruling. By dismissing the Prop 8 case, thousands of same-sex couples in California that had previously been married can once again have their marriage recognized by the state.

“I am overjoyed that the Supreme Court has come down on the side of equality, justice and love by striking down the Defense of Marriage Act,” Pocan said. “No more will thousands of loving gay and lesbian couples see their marriage ignored by the federal government, leaving them without the protections opposite-sex married couples enjoy. With 93 million Americans now living in states that recognize same-sex marriages, and 58 percent of the country in favor of marriage equality, we now have the public, the courts and the Constitution on our side.

“I am also thrilled that by dismissing thePerrycase, thousands of same-sex couples and families in California can once again have their love respected under the law, and Prop 8 can once again take its rightful place in our country’s history books.

“As we celebrate this momentous occasion, we must continue to move forward and ensure all loving couples are treated as equals. While my husband Phil and I continue to wait to have our marriage recognized by both Wisconsin and Washington, I am now more confident than ever that full marriage equality is a question not of if, but when.”

Pocan, a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, is the only current gay-married member of Congress. His husband, Phil, was recently issued a congressional spouse ID—the first ever spousal ID issued to a partner of a gay member.==
Title: Pocan & Ellison: Supreme Court Voting Rights Act Decision Demonstrates Need for National Right to Vote Amendment
Date: June 25, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), authors of theRight to Vote Amendmentthat would provide an affirmative constitutional right to vote for all Americans, today issued the following statement after the Supreme Court rejected Section 4 of the landmark Voting Right Act, which contains a formula to determine specified jurisdictions that need federal government approval before making voting changes that could be racially discriminatory. In its ruling onShelby County v. Holder, the Court determined that the current formula was outdated. Congress is now required to pass a new formula that reflects current conditions.

“Today’s Supreme Court decision is an assault on what should be our most fundamental right as Americans. While the Court is correct that current law to protect voters from discriminatory voting laws is outdated, it is because it’s not expansive enough. The right to vote is under attack across the country. Already in 2013, more than 30 states have introduced over 80 restrictive voting laws that often target low-income, student, elderly and minority voters.

“As disappointed as we are by today’s decision, it demonstrates why we cannot wait to enact a constitutional amendment that would guarantee an affirmative right to vote for all Americans—no matter where they live. A country built on the foundation of civic participation should never tolerate any politically-motivated threats to our ability to express our views at the polls. We will continue to work with our colleagues and build the grassroots support needed to ensure we protect our right to vote.”

Last month, Pocan and Ellison introduced legislation to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans the affirmative right to vote and empower Congress to protect this right. Without a constitutional provision, courts have upheld voter identification laws, burdensome registration requirements, and reduced early voting opportunities in various states across the country. We need a constitutional amendment to protect this fundamental right.###==

Title: Pocan Completes SNAP Challenge; Votes to Restore Food Stamps Funding to Farm Bill
Date: June 19, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) concluded the “SNAP Challenge” today, ending a week during which he lived off the food stamp budget of $4.50 of food per day to bring attention to the country’s hunger crisis and highlight Republican efforts to cut $20.5 billion from this critical food assistance program. On his final day of the challenge, Pocan voted on an amendment to the Farm Bill that would have restored the Republican cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which benefits more than 800,000 Wisconsinites. The amendment failed on a largely party-line vote.

Every day in this country, SNAP prevents 47 million Americans from going hungry. The average nationwide weekly benefit for someone on SNAP is $31.50 a week, which breaks down to $4.50 per day and $1.50 per meal. Approximately two-thirds of the benefits go to children, the elderly or the severely disabled. Yet if the proposed $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP are implemented, two million Americans would be kicked out of the program, and 210,000 children in low-income families would lose access to free school meals.

“For the past week, I have stood with the 800,000 Wisconsinites who use SNAP benefits to put food on their family’s table,” Pocan said. “While the challenge has been difficult, my experience is nothing compared to the daily struggles our hungry citizens face every day. For them, SNAP is a vital lifeline that helps feed their families and lift themselves out of severe poverty. The dangerous cuts proposed by my colleagues across the aisle will have deep, devastating consequences for the neediest Americans if they become law. I was proud to vote to reverse these cuts, and I will continue to fight to make sure no American is allowed to go hungry.”

Pocan posted regular updates throughout the SNAP Challenge on hisFacebookandTwitterpages.==

Title: Pocan & Rangel Announce Legislation to Correct Records of 114,000 Gay Veterans Discharged because of their Sexual Orientation
Date: June 19, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—Almost two years since the landmark repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” tens of thousands of gay veterans who served this country with honor and dignity possess records that remain blemished with a range of discharges because of their sexuality. To support the Department of Defense’s efforts to rectify this injustice, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charlie Rangel (D-NY) today proposed legislation, the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” that would ensure gay and lesbian service members who were discharged for no other reason than their sexual orientation have their records upgraded to reflect their honorable service.

Since World War II to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation.

“As we celebrate the considerable progress we’ve made toward full equality in our military, we cannot forget about those who continue to suffer because of the discriminatory policies of our past,” said Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “Our legislation ensures that gay veterans who selflessly served our country no longer live with tarnished records that prohibit them from receiving the recognition, benefits and honors they deserve. By enshrining the implementation of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” repeal into law, our country can finally close this dark chapter of our history and move forward.”

"As an American, a Congressman, and a Korean War Veteran, I was proud to join my colleagues in ending the discriminatory law that previously barred open gay and lesbian soldiers from serving their country,” said Rangel. “Now is the time to finish the job and ensure that all those who served honorably are recognized for their Honorable service regardless of their sexual orientation."

“The repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ was a tremendous first step in achieving equality in our nation’s Armed Forces. It is important that we continue to address the discrimination that LGBT veterans face by updating their service records to reflect the reality of their service” said HRC Legislative Director Allison Herwitt. “We are thankful that Reps. Pocan (D-WI) and Rangel (D-NY) have addressed this issue with the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act.’”

The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the character of discharge varied, many members received discharges that were classified as other than honorable or dishonorable, particularly prior to the implementation of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy in 1993. In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a general discharge, a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries.

The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable. It also removes any indication of a service member’s sexual orientation from the record, so they are not automatically “outed” to those accessing their record and protects against future discrimination by decriminalizing consensual relations between same sex couples, bringing military law in line with Supreme Court rulings.###==

Title: Pocan Condemns Extreme Anti-Abortion Bill
Date: June 18, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON –U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today condemned the extreme and very likely unconstitutional bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives that would place a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and roll back critical women’s rights. A vote on the bill is scheduled for later this evening.

The bill, pushed by Republican Rep. Trent Franks (AZ-08), effectively bans abortions after 20 weeks with minimal exceptions and marks another GOP attempt to limit women’s rights across the country. Last week, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Senate passed a bill that mandates medically unnecessary ultrasounds before an abortion can be performed. Both bills amount to deep infringements on women’s hard-fought rights and represent a severe government intrusion into a woman’s personal health decisions.

“This is extremism at its worst. From Washington to Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers seem to think it is their job to get in between a woman and her doctor,” Pocan said. “These dual, dangerous efforts are out of sync with what Americans believe. Yet Republicans seem to think it’s a better use of time and taxpayer dollars to roll back women’s rights than focus on economic growth, ending the sequester, completing a budget, and preventing student loan interest rates from doubling. Women’s rights are not a political toy for Republicans to throw out whenever they want to score cheap points—they are fundamental rights that deserve absolute protection. I will vote firmly against this abortion ban and I will continue to fight to protect women’s rights in Wisconsin and across the country.”

Title: Pocan Celebrates National Small Business Week
Date: June 17, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a small business owner for more than two decades, today honored small businesses across Wisconsin in celebration of the 50thAnnual National Small Business Week. National Small Business Week recognizes the immense contributions of the country’s small business owners to the economy and culture of America.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our Wisconsin economy, and they are the key to ensuring long-term growth and job creation across the state,” Pocan said. “When we support our small businesses owners, we support our communities, our economy and the entrepreneurial drive of our citizens. But as a small business owner myself, I know firsthand the challenges than entrepreneurs face when trying to build and expand their business in a recovering economy. That’s why in Congress, I’m focused on how we can create an environment where small businesses can grow, hire and thrive. From providing incentives for businesses to create jobs, to reducing burdensome and confusing paperwork, to ending the sequester that cuts $900 million in critical small business loans, we can take proactive steps to empower our small business owners with the tools and certainty they need to get people back to work.”

Under the sequester, small business owners are projected to lose access to more than $900 million in loans, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the sequester will cost 750,000 American jobs this year, including 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin. Pocan supports replacing the devastating sequester cuts with a balanced agreement that creates jobs, strengthens the middle class and responsibly reduces the deficit.

A lifelong advocate for small businesses, Pocan has co-sponsored the following bills to support small businesses and promote economic growth:

• Make it in America Manufacturing Act
• Cancel the Sequester Act of 2013
• Workforce Infrastructure for Skilled Employees (WISE) Investment Act
• Job Skills for America's Students Act
• Invest in American Jobs Act
• Small Business Tax Equity Act

Title: Pocan Pushes for Action to Prevent Student Loan Rates from Doubling for 160,000 Wisconsin Students
Date: June 14, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON – With less than 20 days till student loan interest rates will double for nearly 160,000 Wisconsin students, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan is taking action to force a vote to prevent this unnecessary financial strain. Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up for a vote the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, which would freeze the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years. If Congress does not act, on July 1 the interest rates on these loans will double from 3.4% to 6.8%--costing students about $1,000 more per year on average.

“If Congress can find the time to vote 37 times on fruitless attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, surely we can find time to support our students striving to advance themselves through higher education,” Pocan said. “At a time when a college degree is more important than ever to obtaining reliable employment, we are in grave danger of pricing too many of our young students out of a college education. Instead of trying to balance our budget on the backs of our students, we need to be increasing opportunities to pursue college diplomas. I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us and freeze these student loan rates before it is too late.”

The drastically increasing student loan debt held by Americans across the country can be considered nothing less than a crisis. Total student debt has tripled over the past eight years and now tops $1 trillion, exceeding all credit card debt in this country. The average student debt held by the class of 2011 is more than $26,000. According to a study from One Wisconsin, it will take Wisconsinites on average almost 19 years to pay off their student loan debt from a four-year university, taking away money that could be spent in our local economies.

Democrats are launching this discharge petition to force action on this broadly supported legislation because Republican leadership has refused to move forward on the bill. The Student Loan Relief Act, which is cosponsored by Pocan along with more than 150 other members, was introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) on April 17, 2013, but Republicans have failed to schedule a hearing or a mark-up on the bill. A discharge petition requires the House to consider the legislation once a majority of Members of Congress (218) have signed it.###==

Title: Pocan to Live on Food Stamps for One Week to Shed Light on Hunger & Poverty in U.S.
Date: June 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – Every day in America, 47 million Americans, including more than 800,000 Wisconsinites, use food stamps—a budget of $4.50 for food per day—to afford their daily meals. Starting tomorrow, Thursday, June 13, U.S. Rep Mark Pocan (WI-02) will stand in solidarity with all Wisconsinites who rely on this critical safety net and participate in a the “SNAP Challenge” by living off a food stamp budget for one week.

The average nationwide weekly benefit for someone on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is $31.50 a week, which breaks down to $4.50 per day and $1.50 per meal. Approximately one in seven families in the United States are in the program, and almost half of SNAP benefits go to children. But Congressional Republicans are currently pursuing $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP, which would kick two million Americans out of the program and mean that 210,000 children in low-income families would lose access to free school meals.

“Sometimes the best way to understand another person’s challenges is to spend some time walking in their shoes. While I will live on $4.50 a day for seven days, we cannot forget that millions of families survive on this and less every day, every week, for months at a time,” Pocan said. “For these Americans, millions of whom are children, SNAP is an indispensable lifeline. We need to protect this critical program from the Republicans’ reckless cuts that would leave millions without adequate resources to feed themselves and their families.”

Pocan will be participating in the challenge between Thursday, June 13, and Wednesday, June 19. He will be regularly sharing photos and thoughts throughout the week on hisFacebookandTwitterpages.###==

Title: Pocan Calls for Increased Transparency on Trans-Pacific Partnership Free Trade Agreement to Protect American Jobs
Date: June 11, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC—Almost 20 years after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that continues to gut the American manufacturing industry and export American jobs, negotiations on a new massive foreign trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Free Trade Agreement (FTA), continue in secret, with little to no-oversight from Congress. In response, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) last week led a letter with 35 other freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.

“Too often, our country’s trade agreements have been a bad deal for American industries and for the American worker,” Pocan said. “As a small business owner, I’ve seen the number of Made in America products available to me dwindle sharply in the past decade because of the unintended consequences of so-called “free” trade agreements. Congress cannot repeat the mistakes of the past by standing by and blindly agreeing to new trade agreements without proper regulation. The administration should make the draft TPP FTA texts public and allow Congress to conduct our constitutionally-mandated oversight so we can ensure economic growth here in America.”

The TPP is a trade agreement currently being negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to oversee all international trade agreements, but the administration is seeking to reinstitute a process called “fast track negotiating authority” or “trade promotion authority,” which would speed up the trade agreement approval process by delegating wide swaths of Congress’s power to oversee international trade to the executive branch. If implemented, Congress would vote to accept or reject a trade agreement, but would be unable to amend the text.

Given these circumstances, Pocan and his colleagues are strongly opposed to attempts to have Congress give up its constitutional responsibility to regulate trade.

“Congress needs to work together to get American trade policy back on track - not give away its authority to do so,” the members wrote. “Reducing our authority to ensure our trade agreements serve the public interest will undermine our efforts to create American jobs and to reform a misguided trade policy that has devastated our manufacturing base through the offshoring of American production and American jobs.”

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, five million Americans have lost manufacturing jobs since the passage of NAFTA.

In addition to Pocan, the letter was signed by U.S. Reps. Ron Barber (AZ-02), Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Ami Bera (CA-07), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Tony Cárdenas (CA-29), Matthew A. Cartwright (PA-17), William L. Enyart (IL-12), Bill Foster (IL-11), Lois Frankel (FL-22), Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02), Pete P. Gallego (TX-23), Joe Garcia (FL-26), Alan Grayson (FL-09), Steven A. Horsford (NV-04), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Hakeem S. Jeffries (NY-08), Joseph P. Kennedy III (MA-04), Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ-01), Annie McLane Kuster (NH-02), Alan S. Lowenthal (CA-47), Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM-01), Daniel B. Maffei (NY-24), Patrick Murphy (FL-18), Gloria Negrete McLeod (CA-35) , Richard M. Nolan (MN-08), Beto O’Rourke (TX-16), Donald M.

Veasey (TX-33).

The full text of the letter is below and attached:

The Honorable Sander M. Levin

Ranking Member

Ways and Means Committee

1106 Longworth House Office Building

Washington, D.C. 20515

Cc: The Honorable Nancy Pelosi

Dear Ranking Member Levin:

We look forward to working with you to establish United States trade policies that promote the creation of American jobs and support our national economic interests while safeguarding Congress’s prerogatives to determine what domestic policies best promote the public interest.

As the economy continues to recover from the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, we can all agree that we cannot afford to have American production and American jobs sent offshore because of unfair trade agreements that undermine our economic growth. When jobs and production factories are offshored, American wages are lost, American-made products decline, and our international interests are compromised.

Job offshoring was a major issue in the previous election that unites our constituents - Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike. Polling consistently shows that Americans oppose our past model of “trade” agreements that facilitate offshoring, undermine Buy American policies, and subject American laws to review by foreign tribunals empowered to order payment of unlimited U.S. tax dollars to foreign firms that seek to avoid playing by the same rules as U.S. firms.

Thus, we write with serious concerns about both the Trans-Pacific Partnership Free Trade Agreement (TPP FTA) now being negotiated by the Obama administration and the prospect of Congress delegating wide swaths of its Constitutional authority to regulate trade (Article 1, Section 8) to the president through “Fast Track” or any other open-ended delegation of “trade promotion” authority.

In the last Congress, two-thirds of House Democrats joined together on a letter to President Obama demanding access to the draft TPP FTA texts and raising concerns about how the pact could internationally preempt Congress’s domestic policymaking prerogatives. They wrote:

“Since the United States will be obliged to bring existing and future U.S. policies into compliance with the norms established in the TPP FTA, the negotiations USTR is pursuing will create binding policies on future Congresses in numerous areas. These could include those related to labor, patent and copyright, land use, food, agriculture and product standards, natural resources, the environment, professional licensing, state-owned enterprises and government procurement policies, as well as financial, healthcare, energy, telecommunications and other service sector regulations.”

Unfortunately, today TPP FTA talks continue in extreme secrecy. The administration has yet to release draft texts after more than three years of negotiations, and the few TPP FTA texts that have leaked reveal serious problems. Thus, we are especially concerned about any action that would transfer Congress’s exclusive constitutional trade authority to the president.

Congress needs to work together to get American trade policy back on track - not give away its authority to do so. Reducing our authority to ensure our trade agreements serve the public interest will undermine our efforts to create American jobs and to reform a misguided trade policy that has devastated our manufacturing base through the offshoring of American production and American jobs.

Indeed, given the vast scope of today’s “trade” agreements, we do not believe that a broad delegation of Congress’s constitutional trade authority is generally appropriate. Negotiations on the TPP FTA delve deeply into many non-trade matters under the authority of Congress and state legislatures. If completed, the TPP FTA would lock in policies on these non-trade matters that could not be altered without consent of all other signatory countries. Thus, ensuring Congress has a robust role in the formative aspects of trade agreements is vital.

We are all deeply committed to creating jobs in our communities and across the country. To do so effectively, we believe it is critical that Congress maintains its authority to ensure American trade agreements are a good deal for the American people.

Sincerely,

U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ron Barber (AZ-02), Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Ami Bera (CA-07), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Tony Cárdenas (CA-29), Matthew A. Cartwright (PA-17), William L. Enyart (IL-12), Bill Foster (IL-11), Lois Frankel (FL-22), Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02), Pete P. Gallego (TX-23), Joe Garcia (FL-26), Alan Grayson (FL-09), Steven A. Horsford (NV-04), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Hakeem S. Jeffries (NY-08), Joseph P. Kennedy III (MA-04), Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ-01), Annie McLane Kuster (NH-02), Alan S. Lowenthal (CA-47), Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM-01), Daniel B. Maffei (NY-24), Patrick Murphy (FL-18), Gloria Negrete McLeod (CA-35) , Richard M. Nolan (MN-08), Beto O’Rourke (TX-16), Donald M. Payne Jr. (NJ-10), Raul Ruiz (CA-36), Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01), Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09), Eric M. Swalwell (CA-15), Mark Takano (CA-41), Dina Titus (NV-01), Juan Vargas (CA-51), and Marc A.

Title: Pocan Statement on May Jobs Report: “Jobs need to be our number one priority”
Date: June 7, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today commented on the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the report, the economy added 175,000 jobs in May.

“While 175,000 new jobs is promising, today’s report highlights that we still have a long way to go on the road to economic recovery. We have a responsibility in Congress to take proactive and commonsense measures that can provide our business owners with certainty and promote economic growth. And yet Republican leadership, which can find time to vote for the 37thtime to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has scheduled zero votes on any sort of jobs legislation.

“With more than 200,000 Wisconsinites, and almost 12 million Americans, still out of work, jobs need to be our number one priority. We must come together and make strategic investments in education, research and development and infrastructure, and support our small business owners who create jobs in our communities. I will continue to fight to put Wisconsinites back to work and ensure the long-term, sustainable growth that will power our economy for years to come.”

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, today again called on Chairman Darrell Issa to open to the public tomorrow’s closed deposition with Ambassador Thomas Pickering, the co-author of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board’s report. Pocan earlier called for an open deposition when the Ambassador’s testimony was originally scheduled in May. Both Pickering and his fellow co-author, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, sent aletterto Issa expressing their desire to testify publically before the committee and provide the American people with answers it deserves.

“While the date of Ambassador Pickering’s testimony has changed, what remains the same is Chairman Issa blocking the public from hearing what he has to say,” said Pocan. “The goal of our committee should be to conduct a nonpartisan and transparent investigation to determine what happened in Benghazi, and most importantly, how we can prevent a similar attack in the future. Ambassador Pickering has formally requested an open and public hearing, and Chairman Issa should fulfill his commitment to transparency and open up tomorrow’s deposition to the American people.”

Title: Pocan Statement on LGBT Pride Month
Date: May 31, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today released the following statement on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month, which is celebrated in June each year, the same month as the Stonewall riots of 1969.

“Every June, our country marks Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month, when we celebrate and affirm the rights of LGBT Americans and commemorate the hard-fought battles on our path to full equality. As we reflect on the journey we’ve traveled—the struggles, the sacrifices, the stories of love and loss that have defined a decades-long crusade for justice—we recognize the tremendous progress that we’ve achieved, and look ahead to the obstacles that remain on our path toward full equality.

“There is still much work to be done. As a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, I will continue to fight to ensure that all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, are treated with basic dignity and respect.

“Just this past month, my husband Phil and I were proud and excited when he received a Congressional spousal ID—the first LGBT partner to receive such a designation. Yet my husband, and spouses of LGBT federal employees across the country, are still not entitled to the same federal benefits as the spouses of straight employees. I am working to guarantee domestic partners all the federal rights and benefits of married same-sex couples—no matter the result of this month’s Supreme Court cases. We must also pass important pieces of legislation that protect our students and our workers, such as the Student Non-Discrimination Act and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. We must ensure that service members dishonorably discharged under the military’s now-repealed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy can have their records cleared. And we must fight to eliminate discrimination in favor of acceptance—to replace hate-filled attacks on our streets and in our schools with love and respect.

“Today, we have a country that is ready to embrace change and a new generation that demands it. So this month, let us take pride in who we are and who we love, and recommit to making our country a place that is built, as our Constitution mandates, on the fundamental tenets of justice and equality.”

Pocan has been married to his husband Phil since 2006.###==

Title: Pocan Statement on Voter ID Ruling from the State Appeals Court
Date: May 30, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after the 4thDistrict Court of Appeals overturned a decision by the Dane County Circuit Court, which had originally ruled that the state’s Voter ID law violated the Wisconsin constitution.

Earlier this month, Pocan introduced legislation with U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (MN-05) to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Voting Rights Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and empower the government with the authority to protect this fundamental right.

“In a country founded on the principles of civic participation, it is obscene that voters need to prove their fundamental right to vote has been violated, while states can pass restrictive voting bills without demonstrating any need for their actions,” Pocan said. “While I expect that today’s decision is not the last word on Wisconsin’s Voter ID law, it demonstrates that now more than ever, we need an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that will ensure all Americans have a guaranteed, affirmative right to vote. My amendment will transfer the burden of proof from the voter back to the states—forcing them to demonstrate that their actions have a legitimate rationale beyond suppressing the vote for partisan gain. I will continue to fight for my Right to Vote amendment and to protect the voting rights of every voter in Wisconsin and across the nation.”

Under current law, it is up to the voter to prove that his or her right to vote has been infringed. The Pocan-Ellison amendment would place the burden of proof on the states to demonstrate that any efforts they take will not deny nor abridge the fundamental right to vote.

Already in 2013, more than 80 restrictive voting laws have been introduced in over 30 states across the country.###==

Madison, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day, Monday, May 27:

“Every year on Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend this nation and our freedoms. We remember the Americans whose courage, conviction, and character have led them to the frontlines—the heroes who have left us, the veterans who have fought, and the brave men and women who continue to serve.

“These are ordinary citizens—our friends and neighbors, our sisters and our sons—who have taken on an extraordinary responsibility. We must ensure that our servicemen and women, their families, and our veterans-418,000 of whom call Wisconsin home--have the support they deserve. Our heroes have met the call to duty with unflinching bravery and unrivaled patriotism. We owe them the loyalty and commitment with which they have served us. ”

Since 2001, 35,074 Wisconsinites have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, including 1,693 servicemen and women currently serving abroad. Wisconsin has lost 123 heroic men and women from these two wars. Overall, 418,461veterans call Wisconsin home.###==
Title: Pocan Opposes Bill that Would Increase College Costs by $4 Billion
Date: May 24, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today voted against Republican legislation that would cost students and families almost $4 billion in additional student loan interest fees, and called on Congress to take action immediately to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling. If Congress does not act, on July 1stinterest rates on federal subsidized Stafford Loans will double, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, for 7 million low-and middle-income students.

Video of Pocan on the House floor talking about the urgent need to deal with our student loan debt crisis is availablehere.

“This past weekend, 6,200 students graduated from UW-Madison with a college degree and unprecedented levels of student loan debt. Total college loan debt now tops $1 trillion nationally, and too many Wisconsinites are trapped in endless debt that is preventing them from contributing to the economy and achieving the American Dream,” Pocan said. “We need a long-term solution to our student loan debt crisis, but we must take action right now to support our students by preventing interest rates from doubling. Unfortunately, today we voted on legislation that tries to pay down our debt on the backs of our students, making college more expensive to the tune of almost $4 billion over 10 years. A college education is key to increased economic opportunity, and we should be supporting, not deterring, those who strive to pursue higher education.”

If the Republican plan, H.R. 1911, became law, the interest rate for incoming freshmen next year would be 4.4 percent, up from 3.4 percent. However, the rate for subsequent years would be tied to the 10-year Treasury note (T-Note), and would vary throughout the life of the loan, leaving the cost of students' college education in the hands of Wall Street.

In fact, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the projected rate by the time these students start re-paying their loans four years later would be 7.4%--higher than if Congress did nothing and left the rates at 6.8 percent. At the end of the day, the GOP plan would mean more than 7 million low–and middle-income students would have to pay more for their student loans, and would increase student loan debt by almost $4 billion over the next decade.

The weight of student loan debt not only causes hardships for the individual, but also our overall economic recovery. According to research from the Institute for One Wisconsin, Wisconsinites with a bachelor’s or advanced degree make average student loan payments of $388 a month, money they owe before they start to pay for their rent, car payments, groceries, or child care. Due to the burdens of student loan debt, Wisconsinites are renting instead of buying houses, and purchasing used vehicles over new ones—costing Wisconsin more than $200 million annually in lost new car purchases.###==

Title: Pocan Releases List of 37 Actions House Should Take Instead of Voting on 37th Repeal of Health Care Reform
Date: May 16, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington– Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released a list of 37 actions the House should take up to create jobs and support middle class families rather than waste time on a 37thvote to repeal access to health care for millions of Americans.

“From promoting economic growth, to passing a responsible national budget, to making college more affordable, the House should be working night and day to support middle class families and to help get Americans back to work,” said Pocan. “Instead, Republican leadership seems determined to waste valuable floor time on a 37thvote to turn back the clock to when health insurance companies could deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and millions of families had lifetime limits on their coverage. The people of Wisconsin and of this great nation deserve better. Congress must redirect our focus away from partisan pandering and toward efforts to strengthen American families and communities.”

Below is a list of 37 bills and action items the House should be working on instead of voting for the 37th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act:

1. Eliminate the Sequester
2. Appoint Budget Conferees to Pass National Budget
3. Prevent Student Loan Interest Rates from Doubling
4. Paycheck Fairness Act
5. Mandatory Background Checks for Gun Purchases
6. Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform
7. DISCLOSE Act – requires disclosure of political expenditures by corporations and lobbying groups
8. BE SAFE Act – Strengthens Military Sexual Assault Enforcement
9. Address the Veterans Affairs Claims Backlog
10. Put America Back to Work Now Act
11. Pass Comprehensive Farm Bill
12. Invest in American Jobs – Strengthen Buy American Requirements for Investments in Infrastructure Projects
13. Employment Non-Discrimination Act –Prohibits employment discrimination based on perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity
14. Paying a Fair Share Act –Codifies the Buffett Rule, requiring a 30% minimum effective tax rate for taxpayers with incomes over $1 million
15. Reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)
16. Reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA)
17. Building our Clean Energy Future Now Act –Provides grants for public transportation projects to reduce emissions without raising prices or cutting services.
18. Small Business Paperwork Relief Act
19. Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act– Allows same-sex partners of military couples the same benefits as heterosexual partners
20. Student Non-Discrimination Act –Prohibits discrimination or bullying of students based on perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity

Title: Pocan and Ellison Announce Right to Vote Amendment
Date: May 13, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN) today announced legislation to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans the affirmative right to vote and empower Congress to protect this right.

“The right to vote is too important to be left unprotected,” said Pocan. “At a time when there are far too many efforts to disenfranchise Americans, a voting rights amendment would positively affirm our founding principle that our country is at its strongest when everyone participates. As the world’s leading democracy, we must demand of ourselves what we demand of others—a guaranteed right to vote for all.”

“Americans’ ability to elect their leaders is a backbone of our democracy and our most fundamental right,” Rep. Ellison said. “Even though the right to vote is the most-mentioned right in the Constitution, legislatures across the country have been trying to deny that right to millions of Americans, including in my home state of Minnesota. It’s time we made it clear once and for all: every citizen in the United States has a fundamental right to vote.”

"The right to vote is the foundation of any democracy,” said Rob Richie, Executive Director of FairVote. “Adding an affirmative right to vote to the U.S. Constitution is the best way to guarantee that the government, whether at the federal, state, or local level, cannot infringe upon our individual right to vote. Building support for this amendment offers an opportunity to inspire a 21st century suffrage movement where Americans come together to protect voting rights, promote voter participation and debate suffrage expansion."

While the right to vote is essential to our democracy, many laws often infringe upon that right. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2013 more than 80 bills restricting the right to vote have been introduced in over 30 states. Without a constitutional provision, courts have upheld voter identification laws, burdensome registration requirements, and reduced early voting opportunities in various states across the country. We need a constitutional amendment to protect this most fundamental right.

The text of the amendment is below:

SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.

SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.###==

Title: Pocan Votes Against Bill That Plans for U.S. Default
Date: May 9, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today voted against legislation that recklessly prepares the country for default instead of moving forward on a comprehensive national budget to spur economic growth. TheFull Faith and Credit Actwould require that if the country defaulted on our loans, the U.S. Treasury would have to pay bondholders in China and other foreign nations before fulfilling our obligations to our U.S. troops, Medicare patients, and small business owners.

“It is beyond irresponsible that we are even discussing defaulting on our country’s loans,” said Pocan. “This legislation only creates uncertainty for Wisconsin businesses and families by prioritizing payments to China before our own troops, students and small business owners, uncertainty that would only lead to another needless economic crisis. Congress needs to get serious with our fiscal policy and work on passing a comprehensive budget that grows the economy and strengthens the middle class.”

If the Full Faith and Credit Act were to be signed into law and the country were to default on our debt, bondholders from China and other foreign nations would be paid first—putting payments to Americans at risk, including those to:

• 1.4 million active duty troops and 780,000 activated reserves and National Guard
• 3.4 million disabled veterans who served their country with honor
• 1.3 million veterans who receive education or home purchasing assistance
• American small businesses that sell goods and services to the government
• Doctors and hospitals that treat the 50 million Medicare patients around the country

Title: Pocan Statement on April Jobs Report
Date: May 3, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today commented on the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the report, the economy added 165,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent.

“Earlier this week, I met with Wisconsinites at the Dane County Job Center who are doing everything they can to find meaningful employment. Today’s jobs report underscores the need for Congress to do everything we can to promote proactive policies that will spur economic growth and create jobs for the people of south central Wisconsin.

“Washington dysfunction is not the answer. Republicans must appoint budget conferees, and we must all come together to pass a budget that ends the job-killing sequester cuts for everyone—not just the well-connected— and makes investments in job-creating programs such as infrastructure, education, and research and development.”

Title: Pocan on Piecemeal Sequester “Solution”: “Irresponsible and Inadequate”
Date: April 26, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington – With close to 36,000 Wisconsin jobs and vital services to Wisconsin seniors and children on the chopping block due to irresponsible sequester cuts, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement after voting against legislation that would give the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and only the Federal Aviation Administration, flexibility to manage the sequester cuts and prevent staffing shortages.

“The verdict on the sequester is as clear as it was predictable: these are mindless, reckless, and harmful cuts that are slowing economic growth and taking away valuable resources for our families and communities,” said Pocan, a member of the House Budget Committee. “Yet instead of working on a comprehensive, balanced solution that will allow us to protect 36,000 Wisconsin jobs, close to 1,000 Wisconsin children in Head Start, nearly 4 million meals for American seniors, and vital other services and programs, Congress continues to defy logic and try to fix the sequester in a piecemeal fashion that preserves cuts to some of our most vulnerable citizens. This “solution” is irresponsible and inadequate, and it’s offensive to hardworking Wisconsinites who don’t deserve to get caught in the political crossfires of Washington. I continue to urge my Republican colleagues to appoint budget conferees immediately so we can pass a budget that replaces the sequester cuts—all of the sequester cuts—for once and for all.”

Title: Pocan & Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus Praise Re-Introduction of Employment Non-Discrimination Act
Date: April 25, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
Washington, DC – Today, LGBT Equality Caucus Co-Chair U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and the entire LGBT Equality Caucus (Equality Caucus) praised the re-introduction of the bipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bill is sponsored by Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), a fellow Co-Chair of the Equality Caucus in the House, who is joined by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) as the lead Republican sponsor.

The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would establish basic protections in the workplace to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There are still no explicit laws protecting employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation in 29 states and gender identity in 34 states. ENDA would provide a federal level of protection against workplace discrimination in a manner modeled closely on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would apply to private employers as well as local, state, and federal government employers.

Joining Representative Polis and Pocan in introducing ENDA as original co-sponsors were the four other Equality Caucus Co-Chairs and more than 150 original co-sponsors.

“There is no room for discrimination – for any reason – in our laws, in our schools, and certainly not in our places of work,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “Non-discrimination policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity are already in effect at a majority of our nation’s largest companies, and the time has come to ensure they are also passed into law. ENDA represents bipartisan, commonsense policy that guarantees all of our workers, no matter who they are or who they love, have the opportunity to thrive and succeed in the workforce.”

---

The mission of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus is to promote lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality. The bi-partisan LGBT Equality Caucus is strongly committed to achieving the full enjoyment of human rights for LGBT people in the U.S. and around the world. By serving as a resource for Members of Congress, their staff, and the public on LGBT issues, the Caucus works toward the extension of equal rights, the repeal of discriminatory laws, the elimination of hate-motivated violence, and the improved health and wellbeing for all regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.==
Title: One Week Past Budget Deadline, Pocan Urges House Republicans to Stop Blocking Budget Process
Date: April 22, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI – One week after Congress missed its legal deadline to pass a final budget, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans to stop blocking the budget process. Last week, Pocan sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner with his fellow House Budget Committee Democrats urging the Speaker to immediately appoint budget conferees so Congress can move forward and pass a final budget that lays out our national priorities.

The legal deadline for Congress to pass a budget was April 15.

“The people of Wisconsin and the nation deserve a federal budget that reflects our values and lays out our priorities—just like we produce in Wisconsin every year,” said Pocan, who served on the Joint Finance Committee in the Wisconsin State Assembly for six years. “Without a new, comprehensive federal budget, we cannot respond to emerging needs, cut wasteful programs or invest in new initiatives that support economic growth and our middle class families. Unfortunately, if my Republican colleagues refuse to appoint conferees, any progress toward a finalized budget will be halted. I urge my colleagues to come to the table and work on a budget solution that promotes American prosperity and job creation.”

Normal legislative procedure dictates that since the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have passed separate budgets, they convene a conference committee to work out the differences. Despite repeated calls in the past by House Republicans for the Senate to complete a budget, they are refusing to appoint conferees, and are now the only party standing in the way of advancing the budget process.

“There are significant differences in opinion on how to best set the budget on a sustainable path, strengthen the economy and create well-paying jobs, and strengthen the programs providing the modest benefits that allow our seniors to live with dignity. Yet, despite those disparate views, there is no excuse for dysfunction in Congress, and there can be no justification for the failure to engage in a meaningful attempt to find common ground,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter.

“It is the responsibility of Congress to complete its business on time,” they said. “For so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, there can be no further delay. On behalf of these men and women, we respectfully request that you proceed with appointments to a conference committee on the budget resolution.”The full text of the letter is below.April 17, 2013The Honorable John BoehnerSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesH-232, The CapitolWashington, DC 20515Dear Speaker Boehner,We write today to strongly urge the immediate appointment of conferees to negotiate a Fiscal Year 2014 reconciled budget resolution with the United States Senate. Last month, the Senate joined the House of Representatives in passing a Concurrent Resolution on the budget. Now that President Obama has provided his spending blueprint for the approaching fiscal year, it is the responsibility of both chambers to promptly organize a conference committee and proceed with budget deliberations under regular order.Clearly, there are aspects of all three proposals that will elicit strong debate between chambers and across the political spectrum. However, the American people, many of whom are still enduring the effects of an economy in recovery, deserve no less than an honest and serious effort by the House and Senate to reconcile differences and move our nation forward by enacting a budget.There are significant differences in opinion on how to best set the budget on a sustainable path, strengthen the economy and create well-paying jobs, and strengthen the programs providing the modest benefits that allow our seniors to live with dignity. Yet, despite those disparate views, there is no excuse for dysfunction in Congress, and there can be no justification for the failure to engage in a meaningful attempt to find common ground.The joint statement issued by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan regarding efforts to proceed with regular order was an encouraging step. Section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets a statutory deadline of April 15 for Congress to complete action on adopting a joint budget resolution conference report– a deadline that Congress has already missed. It is the responsibility of Congress to complete its business on time. For so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, there can be no further delay. On behalf of these men and women, we respectfully request that you proceed with appointments to a conference committee on the budget resolution.

MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement in celebration of Earth Day, which was founded by former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin Gaylord Nelson:

“This Earth Day, let us follow in the footsteps of U.S. Senator and Wisconsinite Gaylord Nelson and recommit ourselves to the cause of our environment—to conserve our energy, protect our resources and watch over the planet we were given. Earth Day serves as a yearly reminder to strengthen our environmental protection efforts so we can preserve state treasures such as Devil’s Lake in Sauk County and the Ice Age Trail in Dane County for future generations. We must refocus our efforts on exploring renewable sources of energy, curbing the effect of greenhouse gases and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. We also need to work on creating clean jobs, which generate the long-term, sustainable employment opportunities of the future. Above all, Earth Day reminds us that we have a shared responsibility and a moral imperative to leave this world cleaner than how we found it.”

Title: Pocan Co-Sponsors Student Non-Discrimination Act
Date: April 18, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today co-sponsored the bipartisan Student Non-Discrimination Act (SNDA), which would prohibit at the federal level discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It would also help ensure that every student has the protections needed to grow and prosper in a safe learning environment—free from fear and intimidation.

The bill was introduced today in advance of tomorrow’s National Day of Silence, which brings attention to the name-calling, bullying and harassment directed at LGBT youth. Surveys show that nearly nine out of every 10 LGBT students have experienced harassment in school. Earlier today, Pocan observed the National Day of Silence on the House floor.

“Every day, LGBT students across the country are subjected to widespread discrimination, bullying and harassment,” said Pocan. “Bullying harms LGBT students and the communities they belong to. It poisons our school culture, deprives our students of their sense of safety, and—all too frequently—has tragic and devastating consequences.

“We must take meaningful, immediate action to end discrimination against LGBT youth in schools. I stand strongly behind the Student Non-Discrimination Act, and the millions of LGBT students it would help. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.”

SNDA would establish a comprehensive federal prohibition against discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. It would also forbid schools from discriminating against LGBT students or ignoring harassing behavior. Modeled after Title IX, violation of SNDA would result in the loss of federal funding and give victims a legal cause of action for discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.==
Title: Pocan Announces Nearly $900,000 Grant for City of Beloit Firefighters
Date: April 17, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today announced that the City of Beloit's Fire Department will receive a Department of Homeland Security Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency (SAFER) Grant in the amount of $884,565. The funding will be used to hire more first responders to serve the city. The City of Beloit Fire Department was forced to reduce staffing in 2012 by five firefighters due to decreased revenue and increased operational costs.

“During these tough budget times, SAFER grants ensure our local fire departments have the tools and staff they need to keep our communities safe,” said Pocan. “This funding will allow the Beloit Fire Department to better serve the community by hiring more first responders—the heroic men and women who risk their lives to protect our families.”

The SAFER Grant was created to provide funding directly to fire departments and volunteer firefighter interest organizations to help them increase the number of trained, front line firefighters available in their communities. The goal of SAFER is to enhance the local fire departments' abilities to comply with staffing, response, and operational standards established by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Beloit Fire Chief Brad Liggett stated, “Our community will be better served and my firefighters will be able to operate safely and more efficiently by regaining this response capacity. We are very grateful for this grant award and it will have a direct impact on quality of life.”

Title: Pocan Criticizes Shameful Bill to Shut Down NLRB
Date: April 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep Mark Pocan (WI-02), an owner of a union small business and proponent of labor rights, today strongly criticized legislation that would effectively shut down the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and deny legal recourses for workers across the country. The ironically titled “Preventing Greater Uncertainty in Labor-Management Relations Act” would in fact promote more uncertainty for both employees and employers by preventing the NLRB from issuing any new decisions or enforcing existing decisions.

The bill, which will be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives today, arrives at the same time Senate Republicans are filibustering President Obama’s nominations to the NLRB in a transparent attempt to reduce its authority and deny rights and protections to millions of Americans across the country.

“It seems there are no limits that some will go to deny hardworking Americans with the rights and protections they are legally entitled to,” Pocan said. “By effectively dissolving the NLRB, this bill would lead to unnecessary chaos by severely damaging labor relations and creating further uncertainty for both employees and employers. Without a legal avenue for workers to pursue, employers could be emboldened to ignore existing regulations, and worker strikes could become more prevalent since unions would be left with no other recourse. We need to be working on commonsense initiatives to get Americans back to work, not wasting time on politically driven bills that deny our workers the economic security they deserve.”

Title: Pocan on USPS Decision to Cancel Plans Ending Saturday Delivery
Date: April 10, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today commented on the decision by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to withdraw its proposal to end Saturday delivery service. Pocan is a co-sponsor ofThe Postal Service Protection Act of 2013, which maintains the six-day delivery schedule and gives USPS the ability to make commonsense reforms so it can meet 21stcentury customer needs."Today's announcement that the USPS has cancelled its plans to end Saturday mail delivery is a victory for our middle class families, our rural communities and our small business owners in Wisconsin who rely on this critical service. Eliminating six-day delivery would not only threaten the future of this great institution, but also eliminate jobs for thousands of postal workers and severely harm families and businesses that rely on Saturday delivery.

“However, today’s decision does not end the need for comprehensive reform at the USPS, particularly to correct its onerous requirement to pre-fund future retiree health benefits. I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect a six-day delivery schedule and advanceThe Postal Service Protection Act, which will allow the USPS to adapt, thrive and meet the needs of its 21stcentury customer base.”

The Postal Service is the only organization, public or private, that is required by law to prefund future retiree health benefits. Without the pre-funding requirement, the Postal Service would have had an operational profit between 2007 and 2010.

The Postal Service Protection Actwould reform and modernize the USPS by:

• Giving the USPS the ability to reform its funding structure for employee pensions.
• Directing the USPS to use revenue to create innovative postal and non-postal products and services to generate new revenue sources.###==
Title: Pocan Statement on President’s Budget
Date: April 10, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today expressed concern with the budget proposal released by President Obama. Pocan is disappointed with the decision to include a change in how benefits are calculated for Social Security recipients, also known as a chained CPI. According to the Social Security Administration, moving to a chained CPI formula would reduce an 85-year-old’s benefits by more than $1,100 a year.

“The best way to reduce our long-term deficit is to get people back to work, and the president’s budget includes many strong initiatives that will help grow our economy and create jobs for south central Wisconsin. I am particularly pleased that the president’s proposal increases investments in the kind of innovative research and development that is taking place at the University of Wisconsin, while also providing $50 billion for infrastructure projects that will put people back to work on much needed upgrades to our roads, bridges and airports. The president’s budget smartly focuses on promoting advanced manufacturing, as well as supporting small business owners through a tax credit for hiring new workers. His budget also replaces the irresponsible and indiscriminate sequester cuts that are currently leading to furloughs and unnecessary hardships in the second district.

“However, while I respect the President’s desire to achieve a comprehensive and bipartisan budget proposal, I cannot support decreasing social security benefits to those just getting by, especially in the years when they need it most. Social security is a moral promise of economic security we make to our seniors, our veterans, people with disabilities, and our children, and it is a promise we cannot break. Social security has not contributed to our current fiscal problems, and cuts of any kind, including a chained CPI, should not be on the bargaining table. I cannot support any proposal that includes these types of Social Security benefit reductions.

“I am proud to have signed onto a letter to the President with 106 of my Democratic colleagues explicitly expressing our opposition to chained CPI, and to any cuts to Social Security, to Medicare and to Medicaid benefits. Instead of cutting benefits to those who can least afford it, we should look at commonsense entitlement reforms, such as lifting the cap on earnings subject to the social security payroll tax, which would help extend the solvency of this critical program.

“As the budget process continues, I hope to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress on balanced, substantive steps we can take to create jobs, reduce our long-term deficits and support our seniors and working families in Wisconsin.”

Title: Pocan Honors Equal Pay Day
Date: April 9, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement in honor of Equal Pay Day, which marks the day in 2013 when women’s wages finally catch up to what men were paid in 2012.

In the second district, women make only 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. Across all of Wisconsin, women make 78 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts.

“On Equal Pay Day, we commit to ensure that equal pay for equal work is more than just a catch phrase, but a reality. Wage discrimination not only offends our founding principles of justice and equality, it also has a profound impact on the economic security of our families. In my district, women make only 81 cents for every dollar a man earns, which equates to losses of almost $10,000 a year in wages—money that could be used on groceries, child care or educational opportunities.

“I am proud to cosponsor ThePaycheck Fairness Act, which makes important strides toward providing women with the tools they need to fight wage discrimination. The wage gap hurts Wisconsin women, Wisconsin families, and Wisconsin communities, and we have an urgent, moral need to close it.”

Pocan is a cosponsor of the ThePaycheck Fairness Act,which would strengthen and close loopholes in the nearly 50-year-oldEqual Pay Act.Additionally, ThePaycheck Fairness Actwould:

• Prohibit employers from retaliating against workers who discuss salaries with colleagues;
• Put gender-based discrimination on equal footing with other forms of wage discrimination – such as race or national origin – and allow women to take legal action for damages;
• Require employers to prove that pay differences exist for legitimate, job-related reasons;
• Create a negotiation skills training program for women and girls;
• Recognize employers for excellence in their pay practices;
• Provide businesses, especially small ones, assistance with equal pay practices; and
• Enhance the ability of the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate and enforce pay discrimination laws.###==

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today commented on the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the report, the economy added 88,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent.

“While any job growth is good news, 88,000 jobs is not nearly enough to put our economy on a sustainable path for recovery. Unfortunately, from the sequester to the GOP Budget, Washington continues to promote policies that pursue austerity over prosperity. Today’s jobs report should serve as a wake-up call to Congress—unless we invest in programs that grow our economy and encourage job creation, we risk moving backwards into economic stagnation.

“The past two weeks, I’ve been talking with Wisconsinites all around my district about how Washington can support our small business owners and allow them to do what they do best—create jobs in our communities. We need more Wisconsin commonsense in Congress, and I will be bringing their ideas back with me to Washington and fighting for our priorities.”

Title: Pocan on Supreme Court Marriage Equality Cases: “Supporters have country and Constitution on our Side”
Date: March 26, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, today issued the following statement on the landmark marriage equality cases in front of the Supreme Court this week.

In Hollingsworth v. Perry, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to Proposition 8, which amended the California state constitution to prohibit gay marriage. In United States v. Windsor, the justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages that are legally performed in states. Earlier this month, Pocan was one of 17 lead signatories on an amicus brief from 212 Members of Congress arguing the unconstitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

“The Supreme Court has an unparalleled opportunity in the coming days and weeks to move our country closer to our founding ideals of equality for all,” said Pocan. “As the Supreme Court hears challenges to Proposition 8 in California and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, I am hopeful the court will reflect the rising momentum of support for marriage equality and vote to strike down these discriminatory laws that treat LGBT couples as second-class citizens. It has become increasingly evident that supporters of marriage equality have the country and the Constitution on our side.”

A tireless advocate for the rights of the LGBT community, Pocan has been married to his husband Phil since 2006.###==

Title: Pocan Commemorates Third Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act
Date: March 22, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
MADISON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on the third anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010.

“The passage of the Affordable Care Act marks a defining moment in our country where we decided that access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans should be a right, not a privilege. Since the act’s passage, nearly 1.5 million Wisconsinites have received free preventive services, 43,000 young people in the state have been able to stay on their parents’ health care plan, and Wisconsin community health centers have received more than $43 million to expand and improve their services. Because of the law, families in Wisconsin will no longer have to worry that a pre-existing condition will prevent them from receiving health insurance, and women in Wisconsin don’t have to worry about higher premiums merely due to their gender.

“With all the progress we’ve made, I find the actions of some politicians in Wisconsin to be highly worrisome. By rejecting federal funding to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin, Governor Walker is removing guaranteed health and economic security for thousands of low-income children, parents and seniors.

“Forcing thousands of Wisconsinites out of BadgerCare while denying the state close to $1.3 billion of economic activity and 10,500 news jobs doesn’t make sense. Three years removed from the Affordable Care Act’s passage, we need to move beyond the mindless and petty partisan politics, and find ways we can continue to strengthen our health care system for all Wisconsinites.”

Title: Pocan Statement on House Passage of GOP/Ryan Budget: “Déjà vu for people of Wisconsin”
Date: March 21, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, once again voted against the GOP budget proposal introduced by committee chairman Paul Ryan (WI-01). The budget, which Pocan had vigorously spoken out againstin the Budget Committeeandon the House floor, passed the full House in a party-line vote.

“It must feel like déjà vu for the people of Wisconsin. Once again, Republicans in the House have passed a budget that the American people do not support, and has no real chance of becoming law,” Pocan said. “This is a budget whose math is bogus, but whose consequences are real and serious for our middle class families in Wisconsin. From destroying jobs, to raising taxes on the middle class, to turning Medicare into a voucher system, it makes the wrong decisions and reflects the wrong priorities for Wisconsin.

“But the biggest problem with the GOP budget is that it fails to tackle the greatest threat to our long-term deficit—our need to grow our economy and create jobs. With 12 million Americans still unemployed, and millions more who are underemployed, the best budget we can put forth is one that fosters job growth. When we get the people of Wisconsin and this country back to work, we will simultaneously fight our deficit and grow our economy.”

“We will accomplish nothing though if Republicans insist on pushing rejected and recycled policies of the past. We need to work together on a responsible plan that aggressively invests in job growth—in education, in infrastructure and innovation—while cutting wasteful spending and redundant programs where they exist. We must continue to work to reduce health care costs and look at a variety of ways we can find savings and make Medicare more efficient and effective, as proposed in a number of Democratic proposals. And we must decide that as a Congress, we are less interested in partisan posturing, and more interested on working on solutions that put our country on a path to economic prosperity.”

The GOP Budget Proposal would have a devastating impact on Wisconsin families:

• Keeps the sequester cuts in place, meaning 36,000 Wisconsinites and 2 million Americans will lose their jobs
• Turns Medicare into a voucher program, forcing 873,753 Wisconsin seniors out of traditional Medicare
• Increases tax breaks for the very wealthy and big business at the cost of $3,000 a year to middle class families.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Rep. Pocan co-chaired the Joint Finance Committee, where he passed a budget during record state deficits that balanced spending cuts with revenue increases while protecting the priorities and services important to the people of Wisconsin.==

Title: Pocan Statement on Budget Proposal
Date: March 14, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today issued the following statement after voting against the budget proposal that sets spending levels for fiscal years 2014 and 2015."I am disappointed that I cannot vote in favor of the budget proposal on the House floor today. While I commend the budget conference committee on its work to reach a deal, just because Congress has a deal does not mean Congress has done its job."I am thankful this proposal provides some minor relief over the next two years from the devastating, across-the-board sequester cuts that were set to once again hit critical programs in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, sequestration will continue to do needless harm to our families, our students and our economy in the coming year and for years to come. We must continue to work on a solution to replace these harmful cuts once and for all."At the end of the day, the bill abandons 1.3 million Americans who desperately need unemployment insurance, and does nothing to promote economic growth or job creation. Furthermore, the legislation is paid for on the backs of the middle class and military families, while not touching the wealthiest amongst us and allowing corporations to continue to benefit from tax loopholes.""Congress shouldn't be patting ourselves on the back just because we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot. After a year marked by petty partisanship and Tea Party obstructionism, we have to do better. The challenges of growing our economy and strengthening the middle class are too important to keep kicking down the road. There is more work to do, and I urge the House to stay in Washington until we do it."

Pocan was also disappointed that the deal only blocks a scheduled cut in payments for doctors under Medicare (also called the SGR formula) for three months. He supports a permanent repeal of the SGR formula.

Pocan believes voting in favor of the budget proposal would be an unjust acknowledgment that Congress has done its job. Unless Congress passes appropriations bills by the January deadline, this vote alone will not prevent a government shutdown.==

Title: Pocan on GOP Budget: “Does Not Reflect Wisconsin Values”
Date: March 12, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, today commented on the budget released by committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (WI-01). The Budget Committee is scheduled to consider Ryan’s budget proposal tomorrow.

“I’m a small business owner, and I co-chaired the Joint Finance Committee in the Wisconsin State Assembly. I understand what it means to make tough choices when reviewing a budget. But balancing our budgets on the backs of our seniors and working families is not a tough choice—it’s a reckless and irresponsible choice. Our budgets should reflect our values. And the budget the GOP released today does not reflect Wisconsin values or Wisconsin needs.

“Rep. Ryan and I share Rock County between our two districts, and Rock County has one of the highest unemployment rates in our state. Families in Rock County and across Wisconsin are not strengthened by a budget that locks the irresponsible sequester cuts in place, turns Medicare into a voucher program, and preserves tax cuts for oil companies and corporations that outsource jobs . What they deserve are substantive actions from Congress that can lead to economic growth and long-term job creation.

“I want to work with my colleagues on a budget that responsibly reduces our deficits and maintains a focus on growing our economy. We should strengthen investments in infrastructure, education, and research and development, and ensure our tax code incentivizes companies to create jobs in Wisconsin instead of shipping them overseas. Instead of resorting back to recycled policies that have already been rejected by the public and Congress, we need to focus on ways we can work together to move our economy forward.”

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Rep. Pocan co-chaired the Joint Finance Committee, where he passed a budget during record state deficits that balanced spending cuts with revenue increases while protecting the priorities and services important to the people of Wisconsin.==

MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement today on the National Day of Recommitment, urging the American people to mark the two-year anniversary of the signing of Act 10 by Gov. Scott Walker by recommitting to labor rights.

“Like most everyone who was in the state capitol building during the courageous stand against Governor Walker’s anti-worker efforts, I still vividly remember the passionate commitment the people of our great state demonstrated. As I stood with tens of thousands of Wisconsinites, from teachers to fire fighters to students to fellow legislators, many of whom stayed at the Capitol twenty-four seven—I knew we were sending a message to the nation that the rights of workers cannot be untied from the rights of a free people.

“While we were unsuccessful in our efforts to defeat Act 10, that message must live on. From fighting for safe working conditions to defining a minimum wage to establishing child labor laws, the labor movement in our country has always made the country a more equitable and just place for all Americans. Today I urge the people of Wisconsin, and Americans all across the nation, to recommit to our proud history of protecting the rights of the people to organize, and for all of our workers to be respected.”

MADISON, WI—Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today commented on the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that the economy added 236,000 jobs in February, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent.

“Today’s jobs report is certainly good news, but we can’t take our foot off the gas. Too many people in south central Wisconsin are still out of work, and I am deeply concerned that the sequester cuts will slow our economic growth and prevent further job creation. There is more to do. We must come to a balanced solution in Congress that responsibly reduces the deficit while maintaining our investments in programs that lead to a growing economy.”

Title: Pocan Attends Presidential Signing of Violence Against Women Act
Date: March 8, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) yesterday attended the Presidential signing of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) at the Department of the Interior. Last week, House Democrats rejected a discriminatory version of the bill that removed protections for LGBT, Native American and immigrant victims of domestic violence, and then won passage of an inclusive and bipartisan VAWA that expands and improves this historic law. Pocan had joined his colleagues on the LGBT Congressional Equality Caucus in urging their colleagues to reject the discriminatory version of the bill and requiring protections for all victims to be restored.

“I am honored to be a part of history today and join President Obama as he signs an inclusive and expanded Violence Against Women Act. This legislation reconfirms our commitment as a country to do all that we can to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault. Equally as important, it ensures we provide support, protections and a voice to victims—all victims—of these heinous crimes.

“In particular, I would like to thank my fellow Wisconsinite, colleague and friend Congresswoman Gwen Moore for leading the fight in the House to ensure the Violence Against Women Act was passed without compromising our priorities and principles. Rep. Moore inspired myself, my colleagues, advocates, victims and women across the nation with her passion and commitment to seeing this through, even after the bill went more than 500 days without reauthorization. Because of the efforts of Rep. Moore and the advocacy of countless others, today our country is a stronger and safer place.”

Title: Congressman Pocan Votes Against Bill that Keeps Sequestration in Place
Date: March 6, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a member of the House Budget Committee, today issued the following statement after he voted against a funding bill that would keep the irresponsible $85 billion sequestration cuts in place. While the legislation includes funding for the Department of Defense and the Military Construction--Veteran Affairs at fiscal year 2013 levels, all other departments would be funded at fiscal year 2012 levels, which were put in place more than 15 months ago.

“The resolution we voted on today simply continues Congress’s tradition of shirking its responsibilities and kicking the can down the road. Instead of putting in the hard work to craft a comprehensive budget that meets our current needs and priorities, we seem content to avoid the hard work and merely pass old, outdated budgets on a month-to-month basis. The result is that key programs that affect our schools, our environment, our small businesses and our homeland security get left behind.

“Furthermore, this bill would do nothing to avert the indiscriminate and irresponsible sequestration cuts that will slow our economic growth, cut vital services for Wisconsin communities and result in 36,000 lost jobs in the Badger State. Congress needs to stop doing what is easy and convenient and start doing what is right for our middle class families. I will continue to fight for a balanced solution that allows us to responsibly reign in wasteful spending while committing to investments that promote job growth.”

Title: Pocan Urges House Leadership to Bring Congress Back in Session to Avert Sequester
Date: March 4, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today urged the House Republican leadership to bring Congress back in session to work on a balanced solution to avert the sequester. House leadership ended the work week yesterday afternoon without taking action on the $85 billion in indiscriminate, across-the-board spending cuts that the government will begin to initiate today.

“Sequestration is at our door step, and yet the House floor is empty. It represents a dereliction of duty for the House Republican leadership to allow members to leave when hundreds of thousands of jobs are on the line and the economic security for middle class families is at risk.

“All throughout the past few weeks, I’ve heard from my constituents and local business owners about furlough notices and potential closings due to these devastating cuts. Anyone who says the sequester won’t harm our families in Wisconsin and hurt our country’s economic growth is living with their heads in the sand.

“I urge the House leadership to bring us back into session. I am ready and prepared to work with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, as long as it takes, so we can avoid this unnecessary and irresponsible budget tornado as soon as possible.”

According to a report released by the White House earlier this week, Wisconsin communities would face the below consequences if the automatic spending cuts are not stopped and replaced:

• Teachers and Schools: Wisconsin will lose approximately $8.5 million in funding for primary and secondary education. In addition about 10,000 fewer students would be served and approximately 50 fewer schools would receive funding.
• Education for Children with Disabilities: Wisconsin will lose approximately $10.1 million in funds for teachers, aides, and staff who help children with disabilities.
• Work-Study Jobs: Around 550 fewer low income students in Wisconsin would receive aid to help them finance the costs of college and around 420 fewer students will get work-study jobs that help them pay for college.
• Head Start: Head Start and Early Head Start services would be eliminated for approximately 900 children in Wisconsin, reducing access to critical early education.
• Protections for Clean Air and Clean Water: Wisconsin would lose about $3,875,000 in environmental funding to ensure clean water and air quality, as well as prevent pollution from pesticides and hazardous waste. In addition, Wisconsin could lose another $1,479,000 in grants for fish and wildlife protection.
• Military Readiness: In Wisconsin, approximately 3,000 civilian Department of Defense employees would be furloughed, reducing gross pay by around $12.4 million in total. Army: Base operation funding would be cut by about $1 million in Wisconsin.
• Job Search Assistance to Help those in Wisconsin find Employment and Training: Wisconsin will lose about $661,000 in funding for job search assistance, referral, and placement, meaning around 23,120 fewer people will get the help and skills they need to find employment.
• Child Care: Up to 500 disadvantaged and vulnerable children could lose access to child care, which is also essential for working parents to hold down a job.
• Vaccines for Children: In Wisconsin around 2,540 fewer children will receive vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza, and Hepatitis B due to reduced funding for vaccinations of about $173,000.
• Public Health: Wisconsin will lose approximately $543,000 in funds to help upgrade its ability to respond to public health threats including infectious diseases, natural disasters, and biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological events. In addition, Wisconsin will lose about $1,390,000 in grants to help prevent and treat substance abuse, resulting in around 2,600 fewer admissions to substance abuse programs. And the Wisconsin Department of Health Services will lose about $108,000 resulting in around 2,700 fewer HIV tests.
• STOP Violence Against Women Program: Wisconsin could lose up to $120,000 in funds that provide services to victims of domestic violence, resulting in up to 500 fewer victims being served.
• Nutrition Assistance for Seniors: Wisconsin would lose approximately $653,000 in funds that provide meals for seniors.###==

WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan today issued the following statement to honor Black History Month, which is celebrated in February each year:

“For the past 87 years, Americans of all races and backgrounds have come together in February to honor the contributions of African Americans to our history and framework. We of course celebrate the historic trailblazers such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman and Sidney Poitier, but we also take the time to recognize leaders such as Wisconsin’s own Lloyd Barbee, a key civil rights activist who served as president of the Madison NAACP and successfully fought to integrate the school system in Milwaukee. From politics to the arts, and from business to the sciences, African Americans continue to shape the course of our nation’s identity and future.

“Yesterday marked another significant milestone in our country’s history with the unveiling of the Rosa Parks statue in the U.S. Capitol building, the first full-length statue in the Capitol of an African American woman. Rosa Parks embodied the grace, courage and determination of her generation of leaders who changed the course of our nation by demanding we adhere to its founding principles. We honor Rosa Parks and all of our African American heroes, both past and present, by continuing the quest for justice and equality for all who call America home.”

Title: Congressman Pocan & LGBT Equality Caucus Applaud House Passage of VAWA
Date: February 28, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and his colleagues in the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus today applaud the House passage of a comprehensive Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that maintains strong protections for LGBT victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. When House Republicans introduced a substitute amendment to VAWA that removed vital protections for victims who identified as LGBT, as well as Native Americans, immigrants and college students, the Equality Caucus sent a letter to their colleagues urging them to reject the House VAWA substitute because of its discriminatory provisions. Republican leadership in the House ultimately allowed for a vote on the bipartisan Senate bill, which passed the House by 286 to 138. The legislation now goes to the president for his signature.

“Thankfully, common sense has prevailed and we have passed a comprehensive, expanded VAWA that refuses to choose which victims of domestic violence deserve our support,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI). “The lives and safety of our families should never have been pawns in the game of politics that is played too often in Congress. All victims of these heinous crimes, no matter their sexual orientation, deserve the full protection and services provided under this landmark law.”

“Domestic violence prevention has and should continue to be an issue that Democrats and Republicans can agree on and work together to advance,”said Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO). “I am glad that Republican leadership finally realized they could not afford to continue alienating many Americans by attempting to exclude provisions that protect LGBT, immigrant, student and Native American victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault. As a co-sponsor of the inclusive Violence Against Women Act that passed the House today, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for doing the right thing and voting for this bill and sending it to President Obama to sign.”

“I am delighted that we were successful today in defeating a terrible House Republican proposal that would have omitted essential protections against domestic violence and sexual assault for members of the LGBT community, immigrants, and Native Americans,”said Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI).“Instead, a strengthened, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act will become law and help ensure that all women are protected from domestic violence, no matter what they look like, where they come from, or who they love.”

“I'm very proud to be part of the effort to re-authorize a stronger and inclusive Violence Against Women Act,”said Rep.KyrstenSinema (D-AZ).“With this vote today, we affirmed some of our most cherished and fundamental American guarantees – that people deserve our protection regardless of who they are or where they are from.”

“I’m pleased to see the House Leadership giving a vote to the Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which keeps the protections for LGBT women intact,”said Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA). “This is a huge victory, as members of the LGBT community were told time and again over the past year that they didn’t deserve the protections granted in the Violence Against Women Act. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must do all we can to prevent acts of violence, and I applaud the lawmakers and advocacy groups who remain committed to the rights of all citizens, regardless of who they love.

“It's ridiculous that the last Congress failed to pass basic protections for all victims of domestic and sexual violence,”said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY). “After waiting for over 500 days, we can celebrate that all women, children and men including LGBT victims will not have to suffer in silence in the face of domestic violence and abuse.”

These are some of the provisions that differed between the House substitute amendment and the bipartisan Senate bill:

• Removing gender identity and sexual orientation from the non-discrimination policies contained in the bill, effectively eliminating the requirement that all programs or activities that receive VAWA funding provide services to victims regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity;
• Failing to include LGBT populations in the STOP grant program, the largest VAWA grant program, which supports law enforcement, prosecution, court and victim service activities in every State; and
• Eliminating gender identity and sexual orientation from the definition of “underserved populations,” thereby blocking needed funding from service providers who help vulnerable LGBT victims, a population that faces barriers to care.

LGBT victims experience domestic violence at roughly the same rate as all other victims, yet according to a 2011 study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, over 61% of LGBT victims are turned away from domestic shelters.==
Title: Rep. Pocan Delivers First Floor Speech
Date: February 27, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—In his first floor speech on the House floor, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today called on Congress to avert the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, referred to as “sequestration,” and to refocus its attention on economic growth.

To watch Rep. Pocan's speech on YouTube, clickhere.

“The sequester, and its irresponsible, indiscriminate, across-the-board spending cuts, is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing right now to grow our economy,” Pocan said on the floor. “Taken as a whole, these spending cuts represent a harsh austerity policy that I fear could only move our country backwards.

“We need to change the conversation right here in Washington. We need to be talking about what people are talking about in Beloit, and Baraboo and Sun Prairie. Instead of asking about how much we can cut, we need to be asking ourselves how we can jumpstart the economy.”

Unless Congress takes action, on Friday, March 1, the government will initiate $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that will severely impact Wisconsin schools, seniors and small businesses.

“The sequester trades in the tough work and replaces it with massive, indiscriminate, irresponsible spending cuts,” Pocan said. “It’s like taking a meat cleaver to the budget instead of a scalpel. And it could cost 750,000 jobs nationwide, including 36,000 jobs right in Wisconsin.”

Pocan supports a balanced approach to deficit reduction that preserves investments in areas that promote job growth, such as education, research and development and infrastructure.

“The time has come to stop talking about harmful spending cuts, and start talking about getting the people of Wisconsin, and America, back to work,” Pocan said. “We need less austerity, and more prosperity. We don’t have time to waste. “

Pocan serves on both the Budget Committee and the Committee on Oversight & Government Reform in Congress.

Pocan’s full speech is below:

As a lifelong Wisconsinite, and a proud resident of Madison for the last thirty years, I am deeply humbled and honored to represent Wisconsin’s second district in the House of Representatives.

The second district is home to a world-class university, innovative small business owners, and hardworking dairy farmers and cheese makers who produce the best milk and cheese you can find.

I ran for Congress because I wanted to ensure these voices, the voices of south central Wisconsin, are heard, respected, and represented in Washington. And I am committed to serving their needs by working with my colleagues—all of my colleagues—regardless of party affiliation.

But I hate to say it Madam Speaker, but right now the people of Wisconsin’s second district are frustrated, and I understand why. When I went home last week, I met with people from all kinds of professions and all walks of life, and their concerns could not have been more different than what we talk about right here in Washington. What they care about is what all families care about—how can they make a living so they can pay their bills, provide for their loved ones and create opportunities for their children.

They don’t care about political finger pointing. They care about how we in Congress can support an environment where businesses can attract more buyers for their products, hire more workers, and increase wages. In other words, how do we grow the economy?

What I told them, and what I’ll repeat here today, is that the sequester, and its irresponsible, indiscriminate, across-the-board spending cuts, is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing right now to grow our economy. Taken as a whole, these spending cuts represent a harsh austerity policy that I fear could only move our country backwards.

We’ve seen in Europe the severe effects austerity policies have had on fragile economies working their way back from recessions. Four years after the global economic crisis, our friends across the ocean are at risk of a triple dip recession. Unemployment is climbing. And these massive spending cuts, countries have still seen their debt loads increase. Is this the model we want to follow for our country?

Madame Speaker, we must remember that the biggest threat to our long term economic security is not the deficit, it’s the economy. It's the lack of jobs. It’s the more than 12 million people who are unemployed in this country.

I own a printing shop in Wisconsin. And as a small business owner, I can tell you that it’s about the lack of access to capital because of economic uncertainty. It’s about a lack of consumer confidence. And it's about people needing to get back to work.

These are the issues we need to address. Not austerity. And we are not going to create jobs or help spur spending by gutting critical government programs without any thought to the consequences. To people in Wisconsin, that's just politics as usual.

We need to change the conversation right here in Washington. We need to be talking about what people are talking about in Beloit, and Baraboo, and Sun Prairie. Instead of asking about how much we can cut, we need to be asking ourselves how we can jumpstart the economy. We have to invest in our future. And how we can support our local small business owners who are the backbones of our communities.

That is how we'll fix the economy.

We need to support education, infrastructure projects, research and development, and new industries such as green energy that will help lead to job growth and bring our unemployment rate down. And by growing the economy, we'll fix our fiscal problems.

This doesn’t mean that I don’t see a place for responsible restraint. As a former chair of our Joint Committee of Finance in Wisconsin, I understand that when you put together a budget, tough decisions have to be made, and you stay up all night agonizing over the smallest details, the tiniest programs, because these programs make a difference in people’s lives. It’s a lot of work, and it should be, because our budget priorities have a direct effect on the middle class families and on long-term economic growth.

But the sequester trades in the tough work and replaces it with massive, indiscriminate, irresponsible spending cuts. It’s like taking a meat cleaver to the budget instead of a scalpel.

And it could cost 750,000 jobs nationwide, including 36,000 jobs right in Wisconsin. It could mean 70,000 students across the country, and 1,000 in my state, would see their Head Start services eliminated this year. And it would mean that $900 million less in loan guarantees to small business owners nationwide, including in Wisconsin.

Now I’m a co-sponsor of a plan, put forward by Rep. Van Hollen, that would avert these disastrous spending cuts and replace them with a balanced approach that promotes economic growth while responsibly reducing the deficit. I strongly urge my colleagues to come to the table, stop this irresponsible sequester, and then refocus our efforts.

The time has come to stop talking about harmful spending cuts, and start talking about getting the people of Wisconsin, and America, back to work. We need less austerity, and more prosperity. We don’t have time to waste.###==

Title: Four Days to Go: Congressman Pocan Highlights Severe Impact to Wisconsin Communities if Automatic Spending Cuts Take Place
Date: February 25, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

WASHINGTON—Unless Congress takes action, in just four days the government will initiate $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that will severely impact Wisconsin schools, seniors and small businesses. Following a report released by the White House last night that highlighted the specific effects of these cuts on the Badger state, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) once again called on his colleagues in Washington to come to the table and work on a balanced plan to avoid this unnecessary crisis.

“How many warnings will Washington need to force us to take action and avoid this unnecessary and irresponsible budget tornado? How many teachers will we need to layoff, how many more small businesses will struggle to obtain a loan, and how many seniors will need to go hungry for us to decide that the time for political posturing is over?” said Rep. Pocan. “Despite what others in Washington and Madison may say, the effects of these cuts are real and serious. Middle class families in Wisconsin do not deserve to have their economic security put at risk because some in Washington find it politically inconvenient to do their jobs.

“I have joined my Democratic colleagues in the House to support a plan that would replace these automatic spending cuts with commonsense initiatives that will promote economic growth and reduce our deficit without unduly threatening the security of the neediest Wisconsin residents. I am ready and eager to work with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on these and other solutions that will restore the security and certainty our families in Wisconsin need.”

Previous reports on the effects of sequestration have shown that the across-the-board spending cuts would result in the loss of 2.14 million jobs nationally, including 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin, and loan guarantees to small businesses would be reduced by up to $900 million across the country.

Thenew reportindicates that Wisconsin communities would face the below consequences if the automatic spending cuts take place on Friday:

• Teachers and Schools: Wisconsin will lose approximately $8.5 million in funding for primary and secondary education. In addition about 10,000 fewer students would be served and approximately 50 fewer schools would receive funding.
• Education for Children with Disabilities: Wisconsin will lose approximately $10.1 million in funds for teachers, aides, and staff who help children with disabilities.
• Work-Study Jobs: Around 550 fewer low income students in Wisconsin would receive aid to help them finance the costs of college and around 420 fewer students will get work-study jobs that help them pay for college.
• Head Start: Head Start and Early Head Start services would be eliminated for approximately 900 children in Wisconsin, reducing access to critical early education.
• Protections for Clean Air and Clean Water: Wisconsin would lose about $3,875,000 in environmental funding to ensure clean water and air quality, as well as prevent pollution from pesticides and hazardous waste. In addition, Wisconsin could lose another $1,479,000 in grants for fish and wildlife protection.
• Military Readiness: In Wisconsin, approximately 3,000 civilian Department of Defense employees would be furloughed, reducing gross pay by around $12.4 million in total. Army: Base operation funding would be cut by about $1 million in Wisconsin.
• Job Search Assistance to Help those in Wisconsin find Employment and Training: Wisconsin will lose about $661,000 in funding for job search assistance, referral, and placement, meaning around 23,120 fewer people will get the help and skills they need to find employment.
• Child Care: Up to 500 disadvantaged and vulnerable children could lose access to child care, which is also essential for working parents to hold down a job.
• Vaccines for Children: In Wisconsin around 2,540 fewer children will receive vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza, and Hepatitis B due to reduced funding for vaccinations of about $173,000.
• Public Health: Wisconsin will lose approximately $543,000 in funds to help upgrade its ability to respond to public health threats including infectious diseases, natural disasters, and biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological events. In addition, Wisconsin will lose about $1,390,000 in grants to help prevent and treat substance abuse, resulting in around 2,600 fewer admissions to substance abuse programs. And the Wisconsin Department of Health Services will lose about $108,000 resulting in around 2,700 fewer HIV tests and fewer patients with access to HIV medications.
• STOP Violence Against Women Program: Wisconsin could lose up to $120,000 in funds that provide services to victims of domestic violence, resulting in up to 500 fewer victims being served.
• Nutrition Assistance for Seniors: Wisconsin would lose approximately $653,000 in funds that provide meals for seniors.==

Title: Congressman Pocan Co-Sponsors Bill to Ensure Equal Treatment for Military Spouses
Date: February 14, 2013
PR Tag: Press Release

Content:
WASHINGTON—Just three days after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced he would extend benefits to same-sex partners of members of the military, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today co-sponsored legislation that would strengthen and expand the Secretary’s new policies by establishing them as law.

The Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act (MSET) would allow same-sex spouses of service members and veterans to receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples.

“Supporting our servicemen and women and our veterans also means supporting their spouses and families, whose sacrifices often go unseen and unrecognized. This support should not be contingent on whether a member of our military is gay or straight,” said Rep. Pocan, a member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “After the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act is an important step toward equality, and for ensuring we keep our promises to all of the courageous men and women who serve our country in uniform. Moving forward, I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on legislation to ensure that same-sex spouses, no matter their occupation, can receive the benefits and support afforded to all other spouses.”

Even with Secretary Panetta’s new mandates, many same-sex spouses would be precluded from receiving benefits from the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs due to provisions within the Defense of Marriage Act. The Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act would allow the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to recognize marriages as defined by a state. This includes marriages in the nine states and the District of Columbia which have implemented full marriage equality. Because the law would amend U.S. Code, the benefits would be protected from the changing political whims and provide a level of security to same-sex spouses.###==

WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) today attended his first hearing as a member of the House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). The hearing, titled “The Congressional Budget Office's Budget and Economic Outlook,” featured testimony from Director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Elmendorf. Following the hearing, Rep. Pocan released the below statement:

“While I agree with my fellow Wisconsinite, Chairman Paul Ryan, that we must take swift action to put our fiscal house in order, I believe the best thing we can do to reduce our long-term deficits is to get the people of the Badger State and of the country back to work. That means taking a balanced approach to the budget process. We need spending cuts, but we must also preserve investments in items that we know lead to economic growth—infrastructure, education, job training and research and development.

“Congress must be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We can target job growth while managing our budget in a responsible manner. What we cannot do is continue to sit on our hands as middle class workers in Wisconsin struggle to provide for their families.”

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Rep. Pocan co-chaired the Joint Finance Committee, where he passed a budget during record state deficits that balanced spending cuts with revenue increases while protecting the priorities and services important to the people of Wisconsin.==

WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) tonight commented on the President’s State of the Union address:

“Tonight the President spoke to the serious challenges facing our nation and the opportunities we have to grow our economy and strengthen middle class families in Wisconsin and throughout the nation. In order to ensure our nation’s long-term economic prosperity, we need to make smart investments in manufacturing, in infrastructure and in clean energy, and we need to equip our workforce with the skills needed to succeed in the global economy.

“We also need to protect jobs here in Wisconsin, jobs like those produced by small business owner Deb Carey, who runs the New Glarus Brewing Company with her husband. I was thrilled that the First Lady invited Ms. Carey to sit in her box during the speech—she personifies the grit, the ingenuity and the determination of our great state. In Congress, we have a duty to ensure that this type of hard work continues to lead to more opportunity.

“We will accomplish nothing however if we cannot find a way to overcome the partisan posturing that has made Washington a home to gridlock and dysfunction. Tonight I was proud to wear my Problem Solvers Caucus pin along with more than 40 other bipartisan members of Congress who are dedicated to tackling the challenges facing our nation by working together, instead of bickering apart. The people of Wisconsin and of this country deserve a Congress that can rise to the occasion, find common ground and get something done.”
