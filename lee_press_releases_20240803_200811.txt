Title: Senator Lee Introduces the No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act
Date: July 31, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act, legislation that would prohibit the misuse of taxpayer dollars for union-related activities by federal employees during work hours.
“
Taxpayers should not be burdened with the cost of federal employees engaging in union activities
,”
said Senator Lee.
“
Federal salaries are funded by the taxpayers, who rightfully expect federal employees to work on their assigned duties while on the clock. The No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act ensures that union-related activities are conducted on personal time and at personal expense
.”
Since the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978, the practice known as “official time” has allowed federal employees to use work hours for union-related activities and to handle cases before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). This means federal employees can engage in union work, represent bargaining unit employees and advance union causes while being paid by the taxpayer.
The cost of this practice to the American taxpayer is significant. According to a 2016 report by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), federal employees spent 3.6 million hours on union-related business at a cost of $177.2 million. Under the Trump Administration, this number dropped to 2.6 million hours, costing $134.9 million. However, due to the lack of unified reporting requirements, the last available data is from 2019, creating a transparency gap in the current use of official time.
The No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act will amend Section 7131 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code to explicitly prohibit the use of official time for federal employees. The updated law will state:
Any activities performed by an employee relating to the business of a labor organization shall be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status.
The legislation is endorsed by Heritage Action, Americans for Prosperity, and the National Right to Work Committee.

Title: Lee Introduces the SHUSH Act to Simplify Suppressor Rules
Date: July 29, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing (SHUSH) Act, a bill to eliminate the excessive regulation of firearm suppressors. The bill seeks to simplify the purchase process for law-abiding citizens and reduce unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. Senate cosponsors of the SHUSH Act include Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and John Cornyn (R-TX). The SHUSH Act has garnered the support of the National Association for Gun Rights, Gun Owners of America, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
"
Suppressors are safety accessories, and their purchase should not be subject to antiquated federal controls
,”
said Senator Lee.
“
This bill is about making it easier for responsible gun owners to protect their hearing and safety while enjoying their Second Amendment right.
”
“
Suppressors are accessories and should be treated just like magazines, scopes, or gun stocks. Treating an accessory the same as a gun sets a bad precedence for anti-gun legislators to further regulate other accessories in the future. There’s no reason they should be subjected to the Brady registration scheme. We’re happy and privileged to be able to work with Sen. Lee on this legislation
,”
said Hunter King, Director of Political Affairs at National Association for Gun Rights.
“
Gun Owners of America applauds the introduction of the 'Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing Act' (SHUSH) Act. The SHUSH Act would not only remove suppressors from the federal regulations of the National Firearms Act, but also treat suppressors as any other firearm accessory – free from the infringing background check process. Senator Lee’s bill will not only benefit hunters and sport shooters, but also take much needed steps for gun owners to restore the rights protected by the Second Amendment,”
said Aidan Johnston, Director of Government Affairs, Gun Owners of America.
“
Suppressors are nothing more than a muffler for a firearm. They reduce the noise level from that which can cause instant and permanent hearing loss to a safe level
,”
said Lawrence G. Keane, Senior Vice President and General Counsel for NSSF, The Firearm Industry Trade Association.
“
That’s the equivalent of reducing the noise from that similar to a jet taking off to that of a motorcycle. These devices are increasingly popular and legal to possess in 42 states and legal for hunting in 41 states. Senator Mike Lee, with the SHUSH Act, demonstrates a strong commitment to Second Amendment rights and leadership in cutting unnecessary government regulations for a firearm safety device
.”
Background
Suppressors, commonly known as silencers, are non-lethal firearm accessories widely used by hunters, sportsmen, and marksmen. These devices enhance safety by reducing noise, recoil, and muzzle blast. Contrary to popular belief, they do not completely silence firearms.
Currently, the process to legally acquire a suppressor involves an extensive and burdensome procedure through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), including:
Completing two copies of ATF Form 4
Filling out ATF Form 5330.20 Certification of Compliance
Obtaining certification from a local chief law enforcement officer and two copies of fingerprints
Submitting two passport photos and a $200 check to the ATF
This approval process can take 9-12 months, making the purchase of a suppressor prohibitively complex and costly for many consumers.
The SHUSH Act aims to
:
Eliminate federal regulation of suppressors as firearms under the National Firearms Act (NFA) and the Gun Control Act (GCA).
Remove existing taxes, fees, and registration requirements associated with suppressors.
Allow current or retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms with suppressors.
Preempt state regulations on the manufacture, transfer, transport, or possession of suppressors.
Strike provisions requiring mandatory minimum sentences for suppressor possession in certain cases.
Exempt suppressors from regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
Provide a provision for a refund of the $200 transfer tax for anyone who purchased a suppressor within two years prior to the enactment of the bill.
If passed, the SHUSH Act will work alongside the Hearing Protection Act to further deregulate suppressors and remove them from the Gun Control Act of 1968.

Title: Lee Introduces Legislation to Cut Regulations and Accelerate Baltimore's Recovery Amid Bridge Collapse
Date: July 11, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
In response to the recent collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced two pieces of legislation to cut burdensome regulations and expedite recovery efforts for Baltimore and its vital port. The collapse has significantly impacted thousands of residents and businesses dependent on the port for their livelihoods
and
impacted the supply chain nationwide.
“
By temporarily suspending these outdated regulations, we can get the government out of the way and allow Baltimore to recover more quickly and efficiently
,”
said Senator Lee.
“
It’s time for the federal govern
ment to step back and remove the obstacles standing in the way of Baltimore’s recovery, and recognize that these regulations are slowing down growth across the country
.”
Senator Lee’s legislative efforts, the Baltimore Recovery Act and the Restore the Port of Baltimore Act are
designed to provide relief by temporarily exempting the port from federal regulations that are currently slowing recovery and reconstruction. In doing so, Senator Lee aims to reduce the overall cost of the recovery effort by eliminating outmoded regulations that will drive up the total cost American taxpayers will pay in order to rebuild the city’s infrastructure.
The Baltimore Recovery Act would:
Exempt any vessel arriving or departing from the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore from Jones Act requirements for five years.
The Jones Act prohibits non-U.S.-flagged ships from traveling between U.S. ports. By allowing foreign vessels to participate in shipping and reconstruction efforts, aid can be delivered more cost-effectively and promptly.

The Restore the Port of Baltimore Act would:
Exempt any vessel arriving or departing from the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore from the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 requirements for five years.
The Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 restricts dredging operations to U.S.-flagged vessels, which has led to outdated equipment and inflated costs due to lack of competition. Permitting foreign dredge vessels to operate in the port will accelerate and reduce the cost of reconstruction and cleanup efforts.

Title: Lee, Mace Target D.C.’s Absurd, Cost-Inflating Childcare Regulations
Date: July 10, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Childcare Worker Opportunity Act, a bill to alleviate the escalating childcare crisis in the District of Columbia. The proposed legislation seeks to repeal the stringent 2016 regulation that mandates childcare workers to hold a college degree, a rule that has significantly contributed to the shortage of childcare providers and the skyrocketing costs families face. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
“
Parents in D.C. are facing an uphill battle with childcare costs spiraling out of control, making it a privilege only the wealthy can afford
,"
said Sen. Mike Lee.
"
The current regulations are not only impractical but also harmful, pushing skilled childcare workers out of their jobs. The Childcare Worker Opportunity Act aims to remove these barriers, offering immediate relief to families and ensuring children receive the care they need. This bill will bring much-needed flexibility and affordability to the District's childcare system at a time when families need it most
.”
“
D.C. has overregulated the child care industry, much like everything else in this city
,"
said Rep. Nancy Mace.
"
Subsequently, they’ve left families with no options. Our bill with Senator Lee repeals this burdensome regulation, giving parents affordable childcare options and providing greater work opportunities for those who wish to care for children
."
“
The shortage of common sense in Washington continues to make it harder and harder on American families. For example, a completely unnecessary D.C. requirement for childcare workers to hold a college degree contributed to depleting the local childcare workforce. The result: less and less childcare options for parents at increasingly higher costs. Reversing this rule would not only be a positive change for hardworking families in our nation’s capital, but it would send a strong signal reaffirming bipartisan support for making childcare more accessible and more affordable nationwide
,"
said Sen. Katie Britt.
More than half of parents in D.C. report being unable to find childcare for their preschool-aged children, and if they do, they face the highest childcare costs in the nation.
Rather than addressing these issues, the D.C. City Council enacted a 2016 law that exacerbates the shortage of childcare providers by requiring them to hold either an associate or bachelor’s degree. This regulation officially took effect in 2023 and is unique to D.C., with no substantial evidence suggesting that degree-holding childcare providers are more effective than those without a formal university education.
The Childcare Worker Opportunity Act will address these issues by repealing portions of the final rulemaking issued by the State Superintendent of Education of the District of Columbia on December 7, 2016. This action will eliminate the requirement for childcare workers to have a degree, certificate, or a minimum number of credit hours from an institution of higher education to receive their official childcare license.

Title: Lee Introduces Bills to Demand Burden Sharing and Oppose Ukraine Membership Ahead of NATO Summit
Date: July 9, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– As Washington plays host to this year's NATO Summit, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is set to introduce a series of bills to address the strategic misdirection of NATO and the decades-long imbalance in defense spending. The summit marks NATO's 75th anniversary, a milestone that calls for reflection and a reassessment of the alliance's operational readiness and financial posture.
"
European capitals have grown accustomed to U.S.-subsidized security, allowing them to dictate policy without bearing the risks or costs,
"
said Senator Lee.
"
This arrangement has been perpetuated out of deference to the so-called 'rules-based international order.' It's time for Congress to remind the alliance—and the Biden administration—that it holds the power to make treaties, extend NATO membership, and conduct oversight of our commitments abroad.
"
Senator Lee's legislative agenda during the summit includes the following:
Resolution Opposing Security Guarantees for Ukraine
This resolution condemns the Biden administration's recent 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukraine. It asserts that the agreement has no legal force without Senate ratification and rejects it as a "bridge" to Ukraine's NATO membership. Introduced on June 20, Senator Lee will call for unanimous consent and invites additional cosponsors.

HERE
Prohibition on Ukraine NATO Membership
This bill amends the Mutual Security Act of 1954 to stipulate that initiating an accession process for Ukraine will be grounds for immediate U.S. withdrawal from NATO. Senator Lee emphasizes the necessity of this bill to prevent further escalation and undue U.S. commitments.
For bill text, click
HERE
Allied Burden Sharing Report Act
Despite being required by the 1985 NDAA, DOD has not consistently reported on allied defense contributions since the early 2000s. This is an unacceptable status quo. This act mandates the Department of Defense to prepare an annual report on the defense spending and contributions of all 59 U.S. allies.
The report will include:
Defense spending as a nominal figure and percentage of GDP
Contributions to military operations in line with cooperative defense agreements
Limitations placed on the use of such contributions
For bill text, click
HERE
NATO Burden Sharing Report Act
Focusing solely on current and prospective NATO member countries, this act requires DOD to annually report on:
Defense spending as a nominal figure and percentage of GDP
A description of each member's hard vs. soft power contributions for Ukraine
Analysis of defense industrial base health and comparative advantages
Size and structure of armed forces
Areas of reliance on allied assets
Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deliveries or contracts in the previous year
Changes in defense spending over the previous year
Anticipated future spending
For bill text, click
HERE
"
As NATO gathers on our soil, we have the opportunity to demand equitable burden sharing and make it clear that Ukraine's membership cannot be on the table
,"
added Senator Lee.
"
These bills are essential to ensuring that the United States is not unduly burdened by an alliance that refuses to pull its weight or come to grips with strategic realities

Title: Lee, Paul Introduce Resolution Condemning the Biden Administration's Unconstitutional Security Guarantees to Ukraine
Date: June 20, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced a resolution emphasizing the need for Senate oversight and consideration of the Biden administration's bilateral agreement to provide long-term security guarantees to Ukraine. Senator Lee asserts that this agreement, which effectively serves as a backdoor into NATO membership for Ukraine, bypasses Congress and the Constitution by not following the treaty process and restricts future administrations from adjusting the United States' strategic posture toward Ukraine.
"
The Biden administration's decision to sidestep the Constitution and the Senate's role in treaty ratification is unacceptable
,"
said Senator Lee.
"
This
agreement not only circumvents the Constitution but also ties the hands of future administrations. Such significant commitments must be subject to thorough scrutiny by the Senate
."
"
President Biden's bilateral security agreement with Ukraine commits America to yet another endless war. This deal risks entrapping future administrations to a prolonged military engagement without a clear exit strategy or sufficient burden-sharing from our European allies. We must prioritize American interests and avoid endless foreign entanglements,"
said Dr. Rand Paul.
Senator Lee's resolution makes it clear that the Senate must have the opportunity to review the agreement as a treaty through the constitutionally-mandated advice and consent process. By doing so, it ensures that the Constitution is upheld and that the long-term strategic implications for the United States are carefully considered.

Title: Lee, Lummis Introduce Bill to Counter FCC on AI Ad Disclosures
Date: June 18, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Ending FCC Meddling in Our Elections Act with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and
Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Ted Budd (R-NC).
The legislation comes as a direct
response to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 's recent decision to begin rulemaking that would require on-air disclosures for campaign ads created using artificial intelligence.
In May, the FCC, led by a Democrat-appointed majority, voted 3-2 to propose new regulations impacting the use of AI in campaign advertising. The proposed rules would mandate that television and radio providers issue an on-air disclosure every time an AI-created ad is aired. This decision was supported exclusively by Democrat-appointed Commissioners and has raised significant concerns about partisan overreach.
"
The FCC's proposal to impose new regulations on political speech involving AI, just months before one of the most consequential elections in our history, represents a clear overstep of their regulatory authority
,"
said Senator Lee.
"
While I support transparency in the use of AI in campaign ads, I strongly oppose the idea of a Democrat-run federal agency single-handedly changing the rules of political engagement under the guise of regulation
."
Senator Lummis said
, "
It is imperative that we safeguard the integrity of our election processes from bureaucratic overreach. The Ending FCC Meddling in Our Elections Act ensures that the FCC does not distort the political landscape with unwarranted and unauthorized intrusions
."
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr
added
, “
The FCC’s eleventh-hour plan to impose new regulations on political speech right before the election is as unlawful as it is misguided. Senator Lee’s bill would stop this DNC-backed initiative in its tracks. I applaud Senator Lee for his strong leadership and steps to ensure a level playing field as voters head to the ballot box
.”
Senator Lee’s legislation would prohibit the use of federal funds to enforce any order issued as a result of the FCC’s notice of proposed rulemaking, effectively stopping the Commission's overreach.

Title: Lee Introduces Trio of Bills Defending Access to Public Lands
Date: June 17, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a trio of bills today to ensure access to federal lands and reaffirm the authority of state and local jurisdictions.
“
In each of these bills, we aim to return control to those who are closest to our public lands — the states and local communities,
"
said Sen. Lee.
"
By doing so, we can ensure that our conservation efforts are practical, effective, and tailored to the unique characteristics of each area, while expanding access for all Americans to enjoy our nation's natural beauty.
”
The legislative package includes three key proposals:
Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act
Since Congress passed The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibiting motorized vehicles in certain wilderness areas, the bill has been incorrectly interpreted to inhibit human-powered travel. Senator Lee’s bill reaffirms that human travel was never meant to be restricted by the Wilderness Act of 1964.
“
As it stands, too many trails on federal lands, notably in Wilderness areas, have fallen into disrepair or disappeared entirely. Too few people use them and far too few people help maintain them, which is a loss for public awareness of the majesty of our public lands and the need to conserve them
,”
said Ted Stroll of the Sustainable Trails Coalition.
“
Senator Lee’s legislation will reinvigorate Wilderness trail management

Title: Lee Introduces Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act
Date: June 13, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation to ensure that all Americans, regardless of physical ability, can access and enjoy our nation’s public lands.
“
Our federal lands are a treasure belonging to all Americans, funded by their taxpayer dollars
,
“said Senator Lee.
“
Ensuring these lands are accessible to everyone is not just a matter of convenience but essential for allowing all citizens to explore the natural wonders our great country offers.
”
Currently, the federal government manages approximately 640 million acres of land, a vast expanse often unreachable for those with disabilities due to restrictions on motorized vehicles and limited road access. Sen. Lee’s bill would mandate that for every square mile of disability-accessible land,at least 2.5 miles of accessible roads be open to motorized vehicles, ensuring that everyone can enjoy these lands without undue hardship.
Key provisions of the Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act include:
Defining Accessibility:
Establishing clear definitions for disability-accessible lands to guide federal agencies and ensure consistency across public lands.
Updating Plans:
Directing the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to prioritize the updating of travel management plans, improving accessibility for motor vehicle use on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service.
Ensuring Stakeholder Input:
Requiring local stakeholder involvement in decisions about road closures to maintain accessibility and meet community needs.
Maintaining Open Access:
Restricting the closure of roads that would prevent lands from meeting accessibility requirements, except in cases of emergency or significant health and safety risks.
The bill also establishes procedures for public notification and involvement in any proposed road closures, ensuring transparency and community participation in the management of public lands. By removing barriers and increasing accessibility, this bill will ensure that the beauty of our landscapes continues to be a source of inspiration and enjoyment for generations to come.

Support for the Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act:
"
On behalf of our members with disabilities, I would like to thank Senator Lee for his leadership on this issue. Federal land managers are required to analyze the impacts of their decisions on dirt, but they have no requirement to ensure that their decisions don't hurt disabled Americans. Every time decisions are announced to close more of our backcountry roads, I hear from our disabled Americans that they feel discriminated against and ignored. Our federal land managers need strong guidance form Congress to manage our public lands in a way that benefits all Americans, and this legislation provides necessary and powerful protections
." -
Ben Burr - Executive Director, BlueRibbon Coalition
“
As President of the Blue Ribbon Coalition, it has been very disappointing to watch the unprecedented amount of public land closures to motorized vehicle use over the past few years.  These closures do not contemplate the diverse needs of those who use the land.  I am excited to see this piece of legislation from Senator Mike Lee. We all have a right to enjoy public lands and this is a sure step in the right direction and an obvious solution to the challenge of access to those with disabilities
.” -
Ranch Pratt - President, BlueRibbon Coalition
"
Without motorized access, those with special needs and disabilities - including many veterans - will not have access to public lands because they do not have the ability to hike, jump on a bike, or ride a horse. Motorized vehicles are essentially an extension of their body, it’s their legs to enjoy the same great outdoors that able-bodied citizens can enjoy. If you eliminate motorize access to public lands then you take out two user groups that have zero chance to ever experience these public lands. These user groups are not asking to forge new trails, they just want to keep existing routes and trails open so that they can get the same therapeutic experience from nature that able-bodied citizens have access to. At Trail Hero we have had over 5000 veterans and over 1000 people with special needs join us on trails throughout Utah over the last 9 years
.” -
Rich Klein - President/Founder, Trail Hero
“
As President of UTV Utah, one of the largest off-road groups in the state representing over 50,000 families, I strongly support the Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act. This crucial legislation will ensure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from the benefits of outdoor recreation on public lands. Our group has organized numerous rides for those with special needs, allowing them to experience the beauty of our public lands through motorized recreation. Without protected access to these roads and trails, many individuals with disabilities would be deprived of the chance to enjoy these natural spaces. The Act’s requirement for land management agencies to recognize motorized recreation as an important form of disability access is vital. We must safeguard this access to ensure that everyone, regardless of physical ability, can continue to enjoy the magnificent landscapes of Utah. I urge all stakeholders to support this essential legislation
.” -
Bud Bruening, President, UTV Utah
"
As the Safety and Education Coordinator I support any legislation that protects access for people like myself with mobility limitations. When access is restricted to non motorized use, thousands of people are denied the opportunity to experience that area." -
Christie Chatfield, Arizona State Association of 4 Wheel Drive Clubs
“
One of the many blessings of this life is being able to spend time in the outdoors. The Positive affected it has on a persons mind and soul is almost indescribable. Taking away access for those with disabilities would take away the pleasure from them
.” -
Nick Steinbach, Desert Raiders M/C
“
As a cancer survivor who is dealing with long term side effects from chemo it has limited my physical abilities. I can still hike short distances to see things from where I ride my ohv to but if ohv access gets eliminated and the hiking gets further then I would not be able to hike the full distance in. We should not be limiting access to our public lands. The discrimination against motorized and disabled users needs to stop!
” -
Andy Gordon, Board Member, Castle Country OHV Association
“
I have been a lifetime OHV Enthusiast and have used both the state and federal lands in Idaho and surrounding states to recreate. I became disabled in 2021 and now require motorized vehicle access to use these public areas. I am ambulatory paraplegic. I am able to walk short distances but cannot traverse uneven ground very well. I require some kind of motorized assistance to get around out in the desert and the woods. Eliminating motorized access would eliminate me from being able to see and experience the forest and desert.
” -
Jeff Bell
“
I am 83 and have recreated on public lands for over 60 years. Many of my fondness memories are of those activities. Personally some of my most rewarding experiences are sharing outdoor adventures with others who haven't yet enjoyed those I have
.” -
Glen Zumwalt, Tri-State ATV Association
“
I support the Outdoor Americans with Disabilities Act. Getting outdoors and recreating on our public lands is a right that all Americans should be able to enjoy. But those with Disabilities aren't able to enjoy them in many cases, because they can't access our public lands without the use of motorized transportation. The travel plans that are being implemented by the BLM and Forest Service completely disregard the needs of Americans with disabilities. Being able to get out and enjoy nature improves their mental health, and in many cases their physical health
.” -
Steven Hawkins, Utah ATV Association
“
Access to public property is about more than just recreation, it is a cornerstone of who we are and why we live in the areas we do. Camping, hunting and all forms of recreation are important to our health and well being physically and economically. To limit access affects both. I ask that you please maintain all roads and trails that have historically been in place.
” -
Darrel Raver, North Idaho Trailblazers
“
As a board member of Castle Country I support this. I wouldn't have been able to see half the places I have with my family if we had to hike or were unable to get there on the sxs. Also, we have a disabled kid within our organization and he is able to drive or ride in a sxs with the group to see a bunch of these sites. If we lock up and close the trails he and everyone else with disabilities are then unable to see the same sites as the people who are physically fit enough to hike for miles. This seems to me to be discrimination at its most basic point
.” -
Jerace Glover, Board Member Castle Country OHV Association
“
Since a small stroke in 2020 I have had limited mobility on my left side. I can walk about 50 yards and then I need help. My Jeep is my only way to access the back country and the many beautiful areas of the southwest. As a landscape and nature photographer any limitations to trail access has a direct effect on the areas I can experience, photograph and share. Please support the Bill to provide access for all Americans

Title: Lee Introduces Two Key Bills to Bolster U.S. Maritime and Naval Capabilities
Date: June 12, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
–Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced two pieces of legislation aimed at enhancing the readiness and capabilities of the United States Navy and Coast Guard. The "Ensuring Naval Readiness Act" and the "Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act" are designed to modernize and expedite the construction and procurement processes for U.S. maritime forces by fostering increased collaboration with allied nations.
"
Both bills are about leveraging our
diplomatic relationships and the comparative advantages of our allies to ensure America remains at the forefront of maritime security,"
said Senator Lee.
"
By modernizing our approach to shipbuilding and repair, we can enhance our readiness and maintain
our military edge, all while ensuring fiscal responsibility
."
"
The Ensuring Naval Readiness Act
" addresses the critical shortfall in our naval forces, echoing the Force Structure Assessment's recommendation for a fleet of 355 ships to ensure a ready and capable Navy. By allowing the option to construct ships or components in shipyards of NATO member countries or Indo-Pacific nations with which the U.S. has mutual defense agreements, this bill aims to reduce costs and speed up delivery times, helping to close the gap between current capabilities and strategic needs.
Following closely, "
The Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act
" proposes a strategic shift in the construction of U.S. Coast Guard vessels. This legislation permits the Coast Guard to partner with allied shipyards to procure vessels more quickly and cost-effectively, without compromising national security. It specifically allows for the construction of major vessel components in foreign shipyards not influenced by adversarial powers, particularly China.

Title: Lee and Manchin Lead Bipartisan Bill to Ensure National Guard Readiness
Date: June 11, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Joe Manchin (I-WV), along with Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Steve Daines (R-MT), J.D. Vance (R-OH), and Jim Risch (R-ID), today introduced the Guarding Readiness Resources Act. This legislation provides an exemption from the Miscellaneous Receipts Act for State Active Duty (SAD) reimbursement payments intended for the National Guard Bureau, allowing these funds to be directed back to the National Guard units that incurred the expenses.
"
The National Guard is a cornerstone of our national defense and emergency response system, responding to everything from natural disasters to national security threats
,"
said Senator Lee.
"
Unfortunately, the current process for reimbursing Guard units creates unnecessary financial hurdles that undermine their readiness. Our bill ensures that the funds used by states to reimburse the National Guard go directly to maintaining and preparing our equipment for future missions.
"
“
We are all incredibly grateful to the brave members of our National Guard who protect West Virginians and all Americans from any threat that comes our way,”
said Senator Manchin.
“I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan Guarding Readiness Resources Act to ensure National Guard units can receive the federal reimbursements they need to continue serving our country safely and effectively. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join this commonsense legislation that supports our Guard men and women and boosts emergency preparedness in our communities.”
"
National Guardsmen are essential to our national defense and disaster response capabilities. Their ability to respond quickly and effectively to natural disasters, civil disturbances, and other state missions is vital to the safety and security of our communities
,"
said Senator Cruz.
"
I am proud to join Sens. Lee and Manchin in introducing bipartisan legislation that ensures funds needed to maintain the Guard's readiness go to the right place. This change will directly benefit our National Guard units across Texas and the entire nation, empowering them to better serve our citizens.
"
“T
he men and women of the National Guard serve our country and communities with bravery and honor. They are often among the first to respond to a major disaster like a blizzard or flood
,”
said Senator Klobuchar.
“
This legislation will ensure they can maintain the resources they need to fulfill their missions.
”
“I’m proud to introduce the Guarding Readiness Resources Act to ensure that our National Guard has the necessary funding for equipment and is prepared for any emergency,”
said Senator Rubio.
“The National Guard continually protects us both at home and abroad,”
said Senator Crapo.
“This bill goes a long way in eliminating federal red tape to ensure readiness and provides the National Guard with the funding, resources and equipment to successfully carry out missions.”
The legislation responds to a significant operational challenge faced by the National Guard. While federal law permits the use of federal assets for state-directed missions,  states must reimburse the National Guard Bureau when the mission is complete. A funding shortfall results when these reimbursements are directed to the U.S. Treasury, rather than the appropriate Guard unit.
Retired Maj Gen. Francis M. McGinn
, president of the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), highlighted the urgency of the bill: "
The National Guard continuously responds to the dynamic domestic challenges this nation faces. Immediate response often requires significant unforeseen state expenditures. While the law allows for federal reimbursement, it is executed in such a way that states never see those much-needed funds. This creates substantial budget gaps that threaten the readiness of the force
,
“said McGinn.
"
The Guarding Readiness Resources Act corrects this oversight and ensures the National Guard has the necessary resources to effectively fulfill their mission. We are grateful for the work of Senators Lee and Manchin and ask for full congressional support for inclusion in the FY25 NDAA.
"
"
The scope of how we utilize the members of the National Guard today can consist of deployments overseas or service to our own communities
," said
Jeffrey Frisby
, Executive Director of the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS). "
The dual mission of the National Guard to serve both the state and federal governments often creates blurry lines in pay, benefits, and even the utilization of military equipment. With the high standards of serviceability for military property, it is important that the funding is always there for repair, maintenance, and to ensure mission success. The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States is thankful for the work of Senator Lee and Senator Manchin to ensure that we eliminate any delays in the funds that would be used to ensure National Guard equipment is always ready, for every mission, no matter where we are called to be next

Title: Breaking the Bank: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Abolish the Federal Reserve
Date: June 6, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act, legislation that would dissolve the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks and repeal the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, which established the System. Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) leads the companion bill in the House of Representatives.
"
The Federal Reserve has overstepped
and repeatedly failed to achieve
its mandate and become an economic manipulator that has directly contributed to the financial instability many Americans face today
,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
This legislation aims to protect our economic future by dismantling a system that enables unchecked government
spending, the monetization of federal debt that fuels it,
and widespread economic disruption. It’s time to end the
Fed
."
"
Americans are suffering under crippling inflation, and the Federal Reserve is to blame
,"
said Rep. Massie.
"
During COVID, the Federal Reserve created trillions of dollars out of thin air and loaned it to the Treasury Department to enable unprecedented deficit spending. By monetizing the debt, the Federal Reserve devalued the dollar and enabled free money policies that caused the high inflation we see today

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Gun Shop Owners and Uphold the Second Amendment
Date: June 5, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the STOP the BIS Rule Act, legislation seeking to defend the rights of American gun shop owners and uphold the Second Amendment. Sen. Lee’s bill would prohibitthe use of federal funds to finalize, implement, or enforce the harmful
interim rule
issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which severely restricts the sale of American-made firearms to international customers. Congressman Mark Green (R-TN) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
"
Time and again, American gun exporters and small businesses jump through hoops imposed by this administration, only to find those standards arbitrarily changed,"
said Sen. Lee.
"This rule is a strategic attempt to undermine an entire industry. We must challenge the Biden administration's relentless assault on the Second Amendment and defend the rights of our small business owners."
“
The Biden BIS has gone rogue. BIS’s new rule on gun exports will make it nearly impossible for many gun shop owners to make a living
,”
said Rep. Green.
“
This rule punishes law-abiding business owners all because of the left’s antipathy for the Second Amendment. Our Founders warned against this kind of sweeping government overreach.
”
The STOP the BIS Rule Act represents a firm stand against overregulation and would ensure that the federal government cannot use taxpayer dollars to undermine our constitutional rights and unduly punish law-abiding gun manufacturers.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Modernize Federal Regulatory Reviews
Date: May 23, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Modernizing Retrospective Regulatory Review Act, which directs the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to leverage technology to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of reviews on outdated and redundant regulations. The legislation is co-sponsored by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Senator Steve Daines (R-MT). Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ) is leading the companion bill in the House of Representatives.
"
Americans deserve a government that moves at the speed of business, not the speed of bureaucracy,
" said
Sen. Lee.
"
By using modern technology to refine our regulatory framework, we can boost economic growth and ensure that our government regulations reflect today's realities
."
“
The federal government should not be an ever-growing beast hindering innovation with red tape and procedural hurdles
,” said Sen. Lummis.
“
The Modernizing Retrospective Review Act will bring the federal government into the 21st century by utilizing modern technology to identify and eliminate unnecessary federal regulations to streamline the regulatory process that has ballooned into a 20-year slog for some industries. It should not take a Washington regulator longer to greenlight a project than it did for someone in Wyoming to come up with the idea
.”
“
American businesses must be given the opportunity to thrive without overbearing, costly, contradictory, and duplicative regulations mandated by the DC Swamp
,”  said
Rep. Biggs
. “
Federal overregulation takes a colossal toll on the U.S. economy. Thousands of new regulations go into effect every year, and there simply isn’t enough manpower or existing technology to sift through previously issued regulations. AI technology is an effective tool that can save taxpayer dollars, benefit American business owners, and promote economic growth.
”
Key features of the bill include:
A mandate for OIRA to issue guidance on employing modern technology, like Artificial Intelligence, to refine regulatory reviews.
A requirement for federal agencies to develop and submit a "Retrospective Review Plan," detailing their strategies for implementing OIRA's guidance.
An obligation for OIRA to report to Congress on the availability of federal regulations in a machine-readable format.
The introduction of this bill aligns with the broader goals of the Trump Administration's deregulatory agenda and leverages the advancements we've made in technology to identify scores of rules and regulations that can and should be eliminated.

Title: Lee and Roy Partner on Legislation to Secure Federal Elections
Date: May 8, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), alongside Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), introduced the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. This crucial legislation seeks to ensure that only U.S. citizens participate in federal elections by requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration.
The SAVE Act is cosponsored by: Sens. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Ted Budd (R-NC), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Rick Scott (R-FL).
The SAVE Act amends the National Voter Registration Act, setting requirements for states to verify U.S. citizenship. It outlines acceptable documentation for proving citizenship and requires states to set up alternative verification processes for citizens without standard documents. Additionally, the legislation compels states to purge non-citizens from voter rolls and establishes federal penalties for intentionally registering non-citizens.
“
“Illegal immigrants and non-citizens across the nation are being improperly registered to vote, allowing them to cast illegitimate ballots in federal elections,”
said Sen. Lee.
“At a time when trust in voting is more important than ever, we must stop foreign election interference and pass the SAVE Act. Voting is both a sacred right and responsibility of American citizenship, and allowing the people of other nations access to our elections is a grave blow to our security and self-governance. I’m proud to stand with Chip Roy to save our democratic process and representative government.”
"
Secure elections are a key cornerstone for any representative government; without them, we won't have a country
,”
said Rep. Roy.
“
Radical progressive Democrats know this and are using open border policies while also attacking election integrity laws to fundamentally remake America. That's why I am proud to introduce the SAVE Act with Speaker Johnson and my Republican colleagues, along with the invaluable support of citizens and organizations that recognize we must end the practice of non-citizens voting in our elections
.”
“
U.S. citizenship is sacred, and foreign nationals shouldn’t be able to vote in America’s elections
,”
said Sen. Kennedy.
“
The SAVE Act would ensure that people who aren’t even citizens don’t cancel out Louisianians and Americans’ voices at the ballot box
.”
"
Under Joe Biden's watch, over 11 million illegal aliens are now here on U.S. soil. That's enough to replace the entire population of Kansas almost FOUR TIMES over
,"
Sen. Marshall said.
"
Democrats motivations behind welcoming this influx of migrants has been clear: they believe these are future Democrat voters. While requiring U.S. citizenship for federal elections has long been a requirement, our legislation finally puts pen to paper on the exact documents a person will need to prove they are, in fact, an American citizen and eligible voter. Proof of citizenship as a requirement to vote in our elections should not be controversial- it is our responsibility to protect the integrity of our electoral process
.”
By implementing rigorous checks for voter registration, this legislation would defend against improper voting and seek to restore confidence in the integrity of our federal elections.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill Targeting Wealthy University Subsidies
Date: May 2, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the No Subsidies for Wealthy Universities Act, a new bill to address the misuse of taxpayer dollars in higher education. The bill targets institutions that perpetuate administrative bloat and advance ideological agendas under the guise of education. Its introduction comes in response to the disturbing wave of violence and antisemitic rhetoric that has swept across college campuses. Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have joined as cosponsors while Congressman Ben Cline (R-VA) spearheads the companion effort in the House of Representatives.
Sen. Lee's legislation specifically aims to eliminate indirect cost reimbursements on federal research grants for universities with endowments exceeding $5 billion and imposes stringent accountability measures on how these institutions utilize taxpayer funds, especially in their administrative and diversity departments.
“
The tax dollars of hard-working American families are going to ultra-wealthy universities, like Columbia and Harvard, supporting woke DEI programs while churning out graduates who riot for the destruction of Israel and desecrate the American flag
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
It is a disgrace, which is why I introduced legislation to cut off certain public funding streams to the richest universities. If they want to trash their reputations as academic institutions, they can do it on their own dime
.”
"
Billions in taxpayer dollars intended for scientific research at wealthy universities, like Columbia and Harvard, are being hijacked to finance radical DEI agendas
,”
said Rep. Cline.
“
This misuse of funds is a blatant betrayal of American taxpayers. Congress has a duty to intervene, ensuring that these dollars are dedicated to legitimate research purposes, not to advance the Left's political doctrine on our campuses
."
Sen. Lee's bill would cap indirect cost reimbursements, which have historically covered vague and non-itemizable expenses such as administrative overheads and building maintenance, at a maximum of 8% for institutions with endowments between $2 billion and $5 billion and at 15% for all others.
Furthermore, the bill requires institutions receiving federal grant money to disclose the allocation of funds towards diversity, equity, and inclusion staffing, ensuring transparency and accountability.
Heritage Action endorses the legislation.

Title: Lee Introduces 2-Year RECA Reauthorization Bill to Provide Compensation for Victims of Atomic Testing
Date: April 18, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a bill to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) for an additional two years. This legislation aims to provide needed compensation to individuals who have been adversely affected by atomic weapons testing conducted by the federal government. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) cosponsored the legislation in the Senate, and Rep. Celeste Maloy (R-UT) is leading the effort in the House of Representatives.
Since its enactment in 1990, RECA has been instrumental in providing support to individuals who participated in atomic weapons testing or lived near test sites during periods of atmospheric testing between 1951 and 1992. The program has also extended benefits to uranium miners, mill workers, and ore transporters who were exposed to radiation while working in the uranium industry between 1942 and 1971.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, "
When the government harms people, victims should be able to receive compensation. Downwinders and others harmed by the nation's early atomic program often suffer the consequences of exposure decades after the fact. Passing my RECA extension would send a message saying the United States government is not abandoning these victims and communities
."
Of the bill,
Sen. Romney said,
“
I’m proud to once again cosponsor an extension of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which will allow residents of Utah who were affected by our nation’s early nuclear program to be properly compensated
.”
Of the bill,
Rep. Maloy said,
“
Many Utahns were harmed by the federal government’s aboveground testing of nuclear weapons during the early atomic program, and decades later they, along with their families, are still paying a high price. RECA was created as a way for the federal government to partially compensate Americans who have developed certain cancers and diseases as a result of being downwind from nuclear testing and exposed to radiation. Congress cannot let RECA expire in June. That’s why I’m working with Senator Lee to ensure that downwinders continue to be covered.
”
To date, RECA has awarded over $2.4 billion in benefits to more than 38,000 claimants. However, the program is scheduled to sunset on June 10th, 2024, underscoring the urgent need for reauthorization.
The proposed bill seeks to ensure that all Americans who live within geographic areas adversely affected by atomic weapons testing are eligible for compensation. It reaffirms the government's commitment to supporting individuals who have suffered the long-term consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Enhance State Input on Federal Grazing Land
Date: April 18, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the State Grazing Management Authority Act, a bill to empower states to manage grazing allotments on federal lands. This legislation seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of rangeland management while fostering collaboration between local stakeholders and government agencies.
The State Grazing Management Authority Act proposes to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to enable the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements with states to administer allotment management plans on federal lands. These agreements would allow states to manage grazing activities subject to valid existing rights and federal oversight.
"
For too long, grazers on federal public lands have faced bureaucratic hurdles and unresponsive management practices,
"
said Sen. Lee.
"
This bill empowers states to tailor grazing management to local needs and conditions, fostering healthier rangelands and stronger communities.
"
Under the proposed legislation, states could partner with federal agencies to develop and implement allotment management plans tailored to local conditions. This approach aims to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of rangeland management, ensuring that grazing practices align with the needs of ranchers and grazers.
Key provisions of the State Grazing Management Authority Act include:
Cooperative Agreements:
States may enter into cooperative agreements with federal agencies to administer grazing allotments on federal lands.
NEPA Analysis:
Cooperative agreements may assign responsibility for conducting National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses to states.
Revenue Sharing:
Grazing fees collected under authorized allotment management plans would be shared between states and federal agencies.
Dispute Resolution:
The bill establishes processes for resolving disputes and ensures that parties directly involved in grazing management retain control over decision-making.
Monitoring and Accountability:
Cooperative agreements would include joint monitoring regimens to track the success of grazing management practices and ensure compliance with established plans.

Title: Grounding the Invasion: Lee's Bill to Close the Gate on CBP One App Use
Date: March 22, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), in response to the ongoing invasion at the southern border and the Biden Administration's decision to validate the CBP One Mobile App as an acceptable form of identification for air travel into and across the United States, has introduced the Verifying that all Aliens have Legitimate Identification Documents (VALID) Act. This legislation directly targets the loopholes exploited by illegal immigrants to travel within the U.S. without proper identification.
Since the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) decided to accept the CBP One Mobile App as a form of identification for air travel into and throughout the United States, there have been over 200,000 migrants entering the U.S. using the app as their sole form of identification, a loophole the VALID Act would permanently close.
The Valid Act is cosponsored by Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), and John Thune (R-SD).
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, "
Every American needs to show ID to enter our country. So why do we make it simpler for illegal immigrants to come in than for our own people? As our nation grapples with an unprecedented invasion at our southern border, the VALID Act resolves to close the loopholes that have allowed 200,000 illegal immigrants into the country unchecked. The Biden administration's policies have blatantly facilitated this crisis, encouraging illegal immigration and compromising our nation's security
."
Of the bill,
Sen. Scott said
, "
Biden's TSA has made the choice to allow illegal aliens with no verified identification to use the CBP One Mobile App before flying on commercial airlines into U.S. airports. This is unacceptable and dangerous. The Biden administration has intentionally made our country more dangerous with policies that put Americans at great risk and weaken U.S. national security. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to keep Americans safe
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Marshall said,
“
Joe Biden's reckless open-border policies have spiraled out of control and created the most immediate national security threat that our country faces, endangering American lives across the country. It is truly inconceivable how, in the face of such a historic attack on our nation's sovereignty, the President of the United States continues to double down, allowing illegal aliens to freely board planes without proper vetting or identification. I am proud to join Senator Lee in addressing the staggering number of migrants exploiting our systems through Joe Biden's CBP One App
.”
Of the bill,
Chad Wolf, former acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Executive Director of the America First Policy Institute, said,
"
Shortly after 9/11 the U.S. Congress, through the REAL ID Act, recognized the importance of establishing certain security standards for identification documents to fly on commercial aircraft. Each presidential administration since 9/11 has worked diligently to bring more security to our skies. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration's policy of allowing illegal aliens to use documents with unverifiable and unvetted information to board commercial aircraft defies common sense and congressional will and makes it easier for illegal aliens to travel than U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. The administration's unlawful use of the CBP One app to mass parole inadmissible aliens into American communities raises both legal and public safety concerns. The VALID Act is an important step in reining in these abuses and ensuring the safety of the American people
."
Key provisions of the VALID Act include:
Prohibits the TSA from accepting the CBP One Mobile App, a Notice to Appear (NTA), or a Notice to Report (NTR) as valid forms of identification for passing through TSA security checkpoints and boarding planes.
Bans aircraft from foreign countries that accept the CBP One Mobile App, an NTA, or an NTR as legal forms of identification from operating in U.S. airspace.

Title: LEE, COONS INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN NDO FAIRNESS ACT
Date: March 21, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced the bipartisan NDO Fairness Act, legislation to safeguard American citizens' privacy and constitutional rights in the digital era. In recent years, the use of Non-Disclosure Orders (NDOs), commonly referred to as gag or secrecy orders has surged, particularly in cases involving electronic data like emails, texts, and personal online information. These orders prevent service providers from informing individuals that law enforcement has accessed their data.
The NDO Fairness Act would address these concerns by requiring the government to adhere to established legal and constitutional standards before obtaining secrecy orders for electronic searches. This move aims to align the criteria for electronic data searches more closely with those for physical searches, where the government generally must notify individuals unless a higher standard to delay such notice is met.
"
The Fourth Amendment protects our right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, including the search of our private electronic communications
,”
said Sen. Lee. “
Americans deserve to know when the government surveils these communications. This bill strikes the right balance between protecting Americans' privacy and providing needed transparency while allowing judges to grant nondisclosure orders when necessary to protect others from harm or preserve an ongoing investigation
."
“
The Fourth Amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures, but individuals can only assert their rights if they are aware that their electronic records have been collected
,”
said Sen. Coons.
“
The current bar for granting non-disclosure orders is too low, and government requests for secrecy are often granted even when they’re not justified by the facts on the ground. The NDO Fairness Act will ensure that NDOs are only issued in circumstances requiring secrecy and will better protect the rights of Americans
.”
Key Components of the NDO Fairness Act:
The Act mandates meaningful judicial review to ensure that NDOs meet constitutional standards. Courts will be required to issue written findings justifying the lawfulness of NDO requests and to limit their duration to 90 days, with possible renewals if necessary.
By enforcing stricter criteria for the issuance of NDOs, the Act protects fundamental rights and ensures that secrecy orders are only granted when truly necessary.
The Act introduces a time-limited duration for NDOs, with a standard period of 90 days, mirroring the process for physical search warrants. Special provisions apply for cases involving severe offenses, such as child exploitation, where orders are limited to one year.
Service providers will have the right to challenge unlawful NDOs, enhancing the protection of Americans' data from government overreach.

Title: Lee Reintroduces Davis-Bacon Repeal Act
Date: March 15, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act, legislation to eliminate the wage subsidy law that mandates federally funded construction projects worth more than $2,000 pay workers the "prevailing wage" rate applicable in the same locality for non-federal projects. This act imposes undue burdens on the economy, disadvantages unskilled labor, and unfairly benefits organized labor at taxpayers' expense.
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Budd (R-NC), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rick Scott (R-FL).
"
The Davis-Bacon Act is a glaring example of how excessive government regulation is detrimental to our economy, favoring special interest groups over the broader public interest and limiting opportunities for workers
,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
By repealing this act, we aim to remove these artificial barriers to economic growth, alleviate the pressure on federal project costs, and ensure taxpayer dollars are utilized more efficiently
."
The act's prevailing wage rates are, on average, 22% higher than market wages, leading to inflated costs for federally funded construction projects, increased administrative workload, and oversight of the varied skill levels required for different construction jobs.
The CBO estimates savings of $10.7 billion over ten years, while the Heritage Foundation suggests that repeal could have saved taxpayers $10.9 billion in 2010 alone, potentially employing 155,000 more workers in construction-related fields without additional cost to taxpayers.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Empower Local Authorities in Managing Native Wildlife
Date: March 15, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Native Species Protection Act, which empowers states with the authority to manage wildlife species found entirely within their borders, without federal interference. The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK).
“
It's time to pivot from the one-size-fits-all approach of the Endangered Species Act
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
We need a better approach to protect endangered and threatened species, and the Native Species Protection Act proposes a solution where conservation is local, sensible, and leaps beyond the inefficiencies plaguing the ESA
.”
The Native Species Protection Act amends the current scope of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), by specifying that noncommercial species that do not cross state lines are to be considered intrastate species. Consequently, these species would not fall under the regulatory purview of the ESA, allowing state and local authorities to take the lead in conservation efforts.

Title: Sens. Lee and Cruz Lead Senate Republicans in Challenging FCC’s Unlawful ‘Digital Equity’ Rules
Date: March 14, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) led a group of 19 senators in introducing a
Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of disapproval
to nullify the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) so-called “Digital Discrimination” order. The order, which the FCC voted to finalize in November, gives the federal government control over nearly every aspect of the broadband industry while exposing companies to expansive, indeterminate, and crippling liability under a “disparate impact” standard. The FCC’s order, which ignores the plain language of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will harm broadband investment and undermine the goal of promoting high-speed internet access for all Americans.
“
The FCC’s heavy-handed 'Digital Discrimination' rule is a solution in search of a problem
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
It’s a broad overreach that threatens to entangle the internet in red tape, jeopardizing the very innovation that has made it a cornerstone of modern life. This resolution is our stand against Biden's attempt to regulate the internet into oblivion, ensuring the internet remains a dynamic and competitive marketplace for ideas, not a utility subject to government whims.
”
“Despite admitting there’s ‘little to no evidence’ of discrimination by broadband companies, the Biden administration has plowed ahead with government-mandated affirmative action and race-based pricing for broadband,”
said Sen. Cruz.
“
The only beneficiaries of the FCC’s Orwellian ‘equity’ plan are overzealous government regulators who want to control the internet. This resolution will roll back FCC Democrats’ unlawful power grab.”
Under the FCC’s new order, nearly every aspect of the internet—including a broadband provider’s deployment decisions, network reliability, network maintenance, equipment, pricing, promotional discounts, customer service, language options, credit checks, marketing and advertising, and more—will be subject to potential FCC enforcement actions, including multi-million-dollar forfeitures and injunctive orders, under a disparate impact standard.
Back in November,
Sen. Lee joined a group of 28 senators in
calling on
the FCC to rescind its draft order.
Co-sponsors of the joint resolution of disapproval include: Sens. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.).
Representatives Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-Ga.) and Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) have introduced

Title: Lee Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Accelerate Adoption of Geothermal Energy
Date: March 14, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) along with Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), James Risch (R-ID), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), all members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced the Geothermal Energy Optimization (GEO) Act to accelerate the adoption of geothermal energy nationwide.
Next-generation geothermal technologies offer several unique advantages that distinguish it from other forms of clean energy — including its potential to complement intermittent energy like wind and solar, its ability to be deployed beyond hot and temperate regions, its versatility to match local demand, and capacity to create new pathways to high-paying quality jobs. Geothermal heat can be used for industrial processes, mineral production, as well as aquaculture and agricultural applications, energy storage, and hydrogen production. It is especially suitable for energy-intensive direct air capture (DAC) facilities and data centers.
“
By introducing this bill, we aim to break down the bureaucratic barriers that have stifled innovation and investment in geothermal technology for far too long
,”
said Lee.
“
Our legislation will streamline the permitting process, making geothermal energy a more feasible option for supplying baseload power to communities across the United States, including Utah, which stands on the brink of becoming a leader in geothermal innovation. Through this bipartisan effort, we are preparing for a future where geothermal power plays a key role in our energy strategy
”
“
With a highly skilled workforce already trained in the technologies of this emerging industry, New Mexico is ready to lead the nation in the deployment of geothermal energy
,”
said Heinrich
. “
By breaking down barriers that are preventing companies from fully harnessing the power of geothermal energy, my bipartisan GEO Act builds on the successful efforts our state has advanced to unlock this new, carbon emission-free energy source. This is how we will accelerate our clean energy future, grow our economy, lower costs for working Americans, and create more high-quality jobs that New Mexicans can build their families around
.”
"
Idaho has long utilized the abundant natural geothermal resources just below its surface. With breakthrough technologies underway, there is great potential to scale up production of this clean, reliable energy. The GEO Act will streamline leasing and permitting processes, allowing the responsible and efficient development of traditional and enhanced geothermal resources on our public lands
,”
said Risch
.
“
Nevada is primed to continue to grow our geothermal energy sector, which will play an essential role in our clean energy future
,”
said Cortez Masto
. “
This bipartisan legislation will make it easier for companies to explore and invest in geothermal projects that power our communities while lowering energy costs for Nevada families
.”
The GEO Act would put geothermal projects on an equal footing with oil and gas projects on public land, and direct the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service to develop a streamlined process for geothermal observation well permits on public land. The bill also creates a Geothermal Ombudsman and Strike Team to provide additional resources for field offices. Additionally, it sets new geothermal lease targets on federal lands and requires the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service to hold auctions more frequently than every two years.
“
In 2005, the U.S. was in an energy crisis and rightly granted oil and gas a categorical exclusion to produce more energy to meet demand. We may be approaching a new crisis if we don’t start producing more clean power to meet energy demand, and this bill helps achieve parity for 24/7, renewable geothermal
,”
said Rich Powell, CEO of ClearPath Action
. "
The GEO Act will streamline the permitting process, expand development leasing, and provide much needed resources to get more geothermal power onto the grid
.”
"
Next-generation geothermal energy is available today to provide 24/7 clean and reliable electricity all over the West, creating jobs in rural communities and enhancing American energy security. We commend the leadership of Senators Heinrich, Risch, Lee, and Cortez-Masto in developing the GEO Act to make it easier to deploy this critical technology at the speed we need to support a thriving economy and stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis,
”
said
Sarah Jewett, VP of Strategy, Fervo Energy
.
“
We are grateful for the leadership of Senators Heinrich, Risch, Lee and Cortez Masto in introducing this critical legislation
,”
said Jeanine Vany, Eavor Co-founder and Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs.
“
The Geothermal Energy Optimization Act of 2024 streamlines the permitting process and will advance geothermal energy development on federal lands. As we look towards the energy systems of the future, Eavor’s technology provides carbon-free, sustainable energy development that aids in the decarbonization of heating and electricity. We also create high-paying jobs and provide grid hardening capabilities – all while using minimal water and land. This legislation will help advance geothermal projects like Eavor’s to become a reality more quickly across the United States

Title: LEE, DURBIN INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN SAFE ACT TO REFORM FISA SECTION 702
Date: March 14, 2024

Content:
Bipartisan legislation would protect Americans from foreign threats and from warrantless government surveillance
WASHINGTON
– With the April 19 sunset of Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA) approaching in just a few weeks, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today introduced the bipartisan
Security and Freedom Enhancement
(
SAFE
)
Act
, a bipartisan compromise bill that protects Americans from foreign threats and from warrantless government surveillance.  This legislation reflects a carefully crafted, pragmatic approach that protects national security by reauthorizing Section 702 of FISA and protects Americans’ privacy and civil liberties by enacting meaningful safeguards against warrantless surveillance and government abuses.
"
The documented abuses under FISA should provoke outrage from anyone who values the Fourth Amendment Rights of American citizens
,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
From warrantless searches targeting journalists, political commentators, and campaign donors to monitoring sitting members of Congress, these actions reveal a blatant disregard for individual liberties. Upholding the Fourth Amendment isn't optional—it's a duty. Our proposed reforms to FISA Section 702 are common sense and imperative to restoring trust in our government's commitment to upholding Americans' rights under the Constitution
."
“
There is little doubt that Section 702 is a valuable national security tool.  However, while only foreigners overseas may be targeted, the program sweeps in massive amounts of Americans’ communications, which may be searched without a warrant.  Even after implementing compliance measures, the FBI still conducted more than 200,000 warrantless searches of Americans’ communications in just one year—more than 500 warrantless searches per day,
”
said Sen. Durbin.
“
Our bipartisan legislation—the SAFE Act—is a sensible, bipartisan path forward on reauthorizing Section 702 with meaningful reforms
.”
Cosponsors of the SAFE Act include: Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Peter Welch (D-VT).
To ensure that FISA Section 702 and other surveillance authorities are used for appropriate purposes and in a manner that respects Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, the
SAFE Act
includes the following key safeguards and reforms:
Requires intelligence agencies to obtain a FISA Title I order or a warrant before accessing the contents of Americans’ communications collected under Section 702—but not before running queries.  This narrow warrant requirement is carefully crafted to ensure that it is feasible to implement and sufficiently flexible to accommodate legitimate security needs.
The bill will not require a warrant for searches of foreigners’ communications or searches to uncover connections between targeted foreigners and Americans.
Requiring a warrant only for accessing content in cases where a U.S. person search has returned results would dramatically reduce the number of cases in which the government must seek a warrant.  According to government reports, less than two percent of U.S. person queries of Section 702 data actually return results.
The requirement contains robust exceptions for exigent circumstances, consent by the subject of the search, and cybersecurity-related searches.
The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent board within the executive branch, conducted an extensive review of Section 702 and found that the government provided “little justification for the relative value” of warrantless searches of Americans’ communications.  In the handful of examples where such searches were useful, the Board Chair noted that the government could have obtained a warrant, received consent for the search, or invoked the exigent circumstances exception.
Closes the “data broker loophole” that intelligence and law enforcement agencies use to buy their way around the Fourth Amendment and statutory privacy protections by purchasing Americans’ sensitive information, including location history, from commercial data brokers.
This provision strikes a compromise by allowing the government to purchase data sets that may include Americans’ information if that information cannot be identified and excluded before purchase.  In such cases, the government would be required to apply strict minimization procedures to limit the retention and use of Americans’ data.
Currently intelligence agencies are left to craft their own rules for purchasing sensitive information without accounting for what information they buy and how they use it.
Bolsters the role of amici curiae who assist the FISA Court in evaluating arguments presented by the Department of Justice by creating a presumption that amici should participate in certain particularly sensitive or important matters and by increasing amici’s access to information.
This provision mirrors the Lee-Leahy amendment that the Senate passed by a vote of 77-19 in 2020.
Adopts provisions requiring additional layers of internal supervision of U.S. person queries and other measures to increase accountability, compliance, and oversight.

Title: LEE, DURBIN INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN INSPECTOR GENERAL ACCESS ACT
Date: February 27, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced bipartisan legislation to expand the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General to include alleged DOJ attorney misconduct.  Currently, the DOJ Inspector General (IG) has no authority to investigate professional misconduct by DOJ lawyers.  DOJ is the only agency whose IG has such a jurisdictional carve-out.  The
Inspector General Access Act
would simply strike this loophole, which leads to an unfair double standard where every DOJ employee—including FBI and DEA agents, U.S. Marshals, and federal prison guards—can be investigated by the DOJ IG except DOJ lawyers.
“
The current IG oversight exemption for DOJ attorneys is nonsensical and undermines accountability in our justice system,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
Our simple bill changes that, ensuring DOJ attorneys are no longer off-limits for IG investigations. I'm proud to partner with Senator Durbin on this common-sense bipartisan effort
.”
“
This is a simple, bipartisan bill that would close a glaring loophole in the law
,”
said Sen. Durbin.
“
This is not a partisan issue.  We should all agree that whoever the Attorney General is, he or she should be subject to independent oversight.  I’m thankful to Senator Lee for his leadership and partnership on this important bill.
”
The
Inspector General Access Act
solves the problem that has long prevented independent oversight of DOJ prosecutors by simply striking the jurisdictional carve out in Section 413 of Title 5, United States Code.  As a result, DOJ’s Inspector General would be fully empowered to investigate allegations of misconduct against Department lawyers.  In addition to enhancing oversight and public accountability at DOJ, this simple, common
sense reform will bring DOJ in line with the practices in other federal agencies where allegations of attorney professional misconduct are already subject to investigation by Inspectors General.
Along with Durbin and Lee, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Chris Coons (D-DE), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Laphonza Butler (D-CA).

Title: Lee Calls Out Commerce: Time's Up on Pause for Gun Export Licenses
Date: February 21, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) led a
letter
urging the Biden Administration to end the unilateral pause on issuing new export licenses for American firearms manufacturers by the Department of Commerce. This pause, initiated on October 27, 2023, purportedly to enhance national security interests, has instead inflicted financial harm on numerous businesses without tangible security benefits. Despite indicating that the pause would last only approximately 90 days, the moratorium on issuing new export licenses remains in effect, and the Commerce Department refuses to clarify when they will lift the pause.
The letter was signed
by Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), James E. Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), John Barrasso (R-WY), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK).

Title: Senator Lee Releases “Dirty Dozen” Disasters in So-Called “Border Deal”
Date: February 5, 2024

Content:
Senator Lee Releases “Dirty Dozen” Disasters in So-Called “Border Deal”
The proposed border deal will not secure our border. Passing it into law would
worsen
the border crisis. Here’s why:
CODIFIES CATCH AND RELEASE:
Gives the Secretary of Homeland Security unchecked authority to release an alien into the United States under ineffective “alternatives to detention.” The illegals only have to express “credible fear” of persecution or the intent to apply for “protection determination.” (SEC. 235B)
ALLOWS UP TO 1.8 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS TO ENTER BEFORE TEMPORARILY CLOSING PARTS OF THE BORDER:
The Secretary of Homeland Security is only required to shut down the border if there are 5,000 average illegal crossings over a consecutive seven-day period or 8,500 in a single day. The Secretary
may
shut down the border if crossings are at 4,000 daily average over a consecutive seven-day period. Even during a border emergency, this bill
requires
the administration to process a minimum of 1,400 illegal immigrants a day. This is 400 more per day than Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said constituted a crisis in 2019. (SEC. 244B)
LOOPHOLES
: Does not count any unaccompanied alien children from non-contiguous countries, suspected trafficking victims, aliens who are determined “exempted” based on decisions by ICE, or aliens who meet screening criteria for asylum. Also allows the reopening of the border once encounters are at 75% of the number that caused the shut down, so if the number was 10,000 per day, it only has to be reduced to 7,500/day to reopen.
LIMITED DURATION
: Limits the number of days each year where authority to shut down the border can be in place: 270 days in first calendar year, 225 days in the second year and 180 days in the third year. The period that this “border shutdown” is mandatory decreases – in year one, the first 90 days are mandatory; in year two, the first 75 days are mandatory; and in year three, only the first 60 days are mandatory.
PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION
: Allows the president to reopen the border any time it is in the “national interest to temporarily suspend the border emergency authority” for up to 45 days.
FUNDS SANCTUARY CITIES AND NGOs SENDING ILLEGALS AROUND THE COUNTRY:
Includes $1.4 BILLION for more FEMA grants to NGOs that provide shelter, transportation, legal advice and other services to illegal aliens and $2.3 BILLION to HHS for Refugee Entrant And Assistance, a slush fund for services to unaccompanied alien children.
SUBSIDIZES FREE, TAXPAYER-FUNDED LEGAL COUNSEL TO ILLEGAL ALIENS:
Orders the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that “all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Homeland Security…have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and free legal counsel for any illegal alien who a judge determines is mentally “incompetent.” Mandates that the government provide legal counsel for UACs 13 years old and under. (SEC. 3512-3513)
EXPANDS PAROLE INSTEAD OF LIMITING IT:
Does nothing to meaningfully limit President Biden’s abuse of parole. The language makes a fake exemption that seems to sanction Mayorkas' current abuse of parole. Under this bill, Mayorkas can parole in all these groups with the implicit approval of Congress. It also creates a dangerous EXPANSION of parole by saying it can now be granted for anyone the DHS Secretary determines has an “urgent humanitarian reason” to stay and any “culturally important purpose warranting the alien’s presence in the United States on Tribal land located at or near an international land border.” (SEC. 3146)
INCREASES GREEN CARDS BY 50,000 PER YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS:
This includes 32,000 family-based green cards and 18,000 employment-based green cards.  Hurts American workers by importing cheap foreign labor. (SEC. 3402)
WORK PERMIT FOR ADULT CHILDREN OF H-1B VISA HOLDERS:
Hurts American workers by providing indefinite work permits to an estimated 250,000 adult children of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders who will be competing for jobs with recent college graduates. (SEC. 3403)
IMMEDIATE WORK PERMITS TO EVERY ILLEGAL RELEASED FROM CUSTODY AFTER THEY PASS AN INITIAL SCREENING:
Current law requires a 6 months waiting period after filing an asylum claim before you can apply for a work permit. Under this bill, applicants are granted an IMMEDIATE work permit if they pass the initial asylum credible fear screening. (SEC. 235C)
NOTHING TO DEPORT ILLEGALS:
Does not require the President or Secretary of Homeland Security to deport anyone.
AFGHAN ADJUSTMENT ACT:
Creates a pathway to citizenship for over 60,000 poorly vetted Afghans who were brought to the country due to President Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. (SEC. 331)
WEAKENS ASYLUM SCREENING BY CODIFYING BIDEN POLICY:
Codifies the Biden asylum officer regulation and empowers USCIS asylum officers to grant asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture without review by an Immigration Judge, ensuring significantly higher approval rates. (SEC. 3141)
NO IMMEDIATE FUNDING FOR THE WALL:
The bill claims to give $650 million for “building the border wall.” This is a budgeting gimmick without any new money. The bill would simply rescind current money and then put it back in with a later date (FY2028) so that President Biden and Sec. Mayorkas don’t have to build any wall and can delay spending money on the border wall. (SEC. 205)

Title: Senator Lee Takes Tech CEOs to Task on Online Child Safety
Date: January 31, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON -
Today, amidst a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled "Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis," Sen. Mike Lee announced the introduction of the Preventing Rampant Online Technological Exploitation and Criminal Trafficking (PROTECT) Act. This legislation addresses the pressing issue of online sexual exploitation and imposes stringent requirements on internet service providers.
The PROTECT Act compels sites to verify the age of all participants in pornographic images and those uploading pornographic images. Additionally, it requires sites to obtain verified consent forms from individuals uploading content and those appearing in uploaded content.  It also stops the sharing of child sexual abuse material and revenge pornography online by mandating that websites quickly remove images upon receiving notice they were uploaded without consent or face potential civil and criminal liability.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, "
Tech companies need to do more to prevent the exploitation that is occurring on their platforms and allow individuals to remove images shared without their consent. The PROTECT Act is a step in that direction
."
Sen. Lee’s bill responds to a disturbing trend wherein survivors of sexual abuse are repeatedly victimized through the widespread distribution of non-consensual images of themselves on social media platforms. A recent study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children revealed a chilling statistic: a single image of child sexual abuse material resurfaced more than 490,000 times after being reported.
Sen. Lee pressed Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, inquiring why more robust and proactive measures were not being taken to ensure the safety and protection of children who use Meta's platforms.
Sen. Lee
: "W
hy not restrict explicit content for 16-17 year olds as well
?"
Mark Zuckerberg
: "
It's my understanding that we don't allow sexually explicit content for people of any age.
"
Sen.  Lee
: "
And how is that going
?"
Victims have had to wage an uphill battle for years, pleading with online platforms to remove images they never consented to share. Sadly, their efforts have often yielded little to no success. Homeland Security Investigations have documented cases where victims of unauthorized images were stalked even two decades after the image's creation. In some instances, predators have targeted survivors' children years later.
The PROTECT Act marks a significant step forward in addressing the critical issue of online sexual exploitation and image-based sexual abuse. By holding tech CEOs accountable and proposing legislation that puts the onus on websites to protect their users, Sen. Lee is pushing for much-needed change in the digital landscape. The PROTECT Act offers hope for survivors and their families, aiming to create a safer online environment.
Survivors Voices:
Of the bill,
Survivor Katelynn Spencer said
, “
When I found out there have been two sexual videos of me posted on Pornhub and other pornography websites for the past 12 years, not once did I feel protected by the law. There are no laws in my state to protect survivors of image-based sexual abuse, but if this bill was and is put in place, it could help so many survivors like me.
”
Of the bill,
Survivor Uldouz Wallace said
, “
Technology is updating everyday but the laws haven’t changed. We need the Protect Act because it will protect the future of our children, women, men and ensure that the internet is a safer environment
.”
Of the bill,
Survivor Victoria Galy said
, “
Online criminal enterprises have been allowed to flourish unregulated for over a decade. Technology has surpassed the reach of our current laws. The internet and technology have become weapons in digital violence. We desperately need a federal law to protect victims against online image-based sexual abuse including edited and deepfake content. The Protect Act would provide this protection. Similar laws have already been passed in other countries and the U.S. is falling behind
.”
Backing from Leading Organizations:
Of the bill,
Jon Schweppe, Policy Director of the American Principles Project said
, "
The more people learn about the online porn industry, the more they demand action against it. By its very nature, online porn is about exploiting the human person, which is why it's no surprise that the industry has turned a blind eye as child sexual abuse material has flourished. Enough is enough. States have taken the lead in the fight against online porn, but federal engagement is needed. APP is proud to support the PROTECT Act, and we look forward to working with Sen. Lee to pass this important bill into law
.”
Of the bill,
Dawn Hawkins, CEO, National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Survivor of Deepfake Pornography said,
“
In an instant, anyone can become a victim of image-based sexual abuse. When child sexual abuse, rape, sex trafficking, or prostitution is filmed and circulated without the permission of those depicted—or when videos made by hidden cameras, deep fake images, or leaked photos are uploaded without consent—survivors have no rights under federal law to get this material removed. Websites distribute and monetize this material, enabling millions of users to watch criminal content or consume deeply personal material. Survivors of these horrific crimes often spend hundreds of hours trying to get it removed from the Internet and for most, their efforts are in vain. The Protect Act would ensure that federal law supports victims of image-based sexual abuse

Title: Lee Aims to End Antiquated Jones Act
Date: January 25, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON
– To address the longstanding challenges posed by the Jones Act, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced two bills: the Open America’s Waters Act and the Protecting Access to American Products Act. These bills represent a comprehensive approach to alleviating the burdens American consumers, businesses, and communities face due to antiquated World War I-era regulations.
Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act, formally known as the Merchant Marine Act, imposes stringent requirements on vessels engaged in domestic maritime trade, mandating that all goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on vessels constructed in the U.S., registered in the U.S., owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed primarily by U.S. citizens. While initially intended to bolster national security efforts in the aftermath of World War I, the Jones Act's inflexible provisions have led to significant costs and unintended consequences.
The Open America’s Waters Act seeks to repeal the cabotage requirements of the Jones Act, allowing all vessels that meet U.S. legal standards to engage in domestic trade between U.S. ports. By fostering competition and reducing barriers to entry, this legislation aims to enhance economic efficiency, reduce costs for American families, and promote a more dynamic maritime sector.
The Protecting Access to American Products Act would establish a framework for waiving certain Jones Act requirements under specified circumstances, such as when no Jones Act-compliant vessel is available for transporting particular goods. This provision would provide much-needed flexibility and ensure continued access to essential products, including liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Under the proposed legislation, federal agencies would be required to promptly review waiver applications and make determinations within 60 days. Approved waivers could be granted for a minimum of 30 days, with the option of extension for additional periods, ensuring timely and efficient responses to emerging needs.
Senator Lee's dual legislative efforts underscore a commitment to addressing the root causes of rising prices and economic stagnation,  and to fostering a more resilient and competitive maritime industry. By modernizing U.S. maritime policies and streamlining regulatory processes, these bills aim to unleash new opportunities for economic growth.

WASHINGTON
– As the nation prepares to observe the annual March for Life, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is reinforcing his dedication to protecting the unborn by introducing four critical pieces of legislation: the Abortion is not Health Care Act, the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act, the Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act, and the Guaranteeing the Unborn Access to Respect and Dignity (GUARD) Act.
“
Each human life, born and unborn, has immeasurable dignity and worth. The lives of both an unborn baby and her mother matter; and healthcare should heal, protect, and preserve both their lives. Our laws and use of taxpayer money should reflect that truth, which is why I have introduced these bills

said
Sen. Lee.
The
Abortion is not Health Care Act
would end the tax deductibility of abortions and clarify that this gruesome practice is not health care. Currently, the IRS categorizes an abortion as “medical care” and allows tax benefits to flow to this practice, subsidizing the killing of hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year. This bill would amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit elective abortion expenses from being considered eligible for a medical expense deduction.
Cosponsors include Sens. Hagerty (R-TN), Braun (R-IN), Thune (R-SD), Rubio (R-FL), Daines (R-MT), Cramer (R-ND), Blackburn (R-TN), Hawley (R-MO), and Hyde-Smith (R-MS).

The
Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts
would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion in health savings accounts. Current law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds from health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts for the “medical expense” of abortion. This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to explicitly prevent abortions from getting a special tax advantage through the use of these accounts.

The
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act
would ensure that our foreign aid is not funding or promoting abortions overseas. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City Policy, prohibiting the availability of family planning foreign assistance funds to organizations that provide or promote abortions or advocate to change abortion laws in a foreign country. Since then, the policy has been alternately rescinded and reinstated with changing administrations.
The Trump Administration rebranded this policy as the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy and applied it to all global health assistance, foreign nonprofits,  and NGOs. This bill would permanently codify an expanded version of the PLGHA policy into law, capturing all assistance provided to foreign or domestic nonprofits, NGOs, and multilateral organizations. With President Biden having rescinded the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy in 2021, American citizens may be complicit in overseas abortions under the guise of “foreign assistance.” Congress must ensure this cannot be the case now or ever again. Doing so would affirm the dignity of unborn human lives everywhere and save countless lives across the globe.
“
This will sound like common sense to most fair-minded people, but the Biden administration should not ship Americans’ hard-earned taxpayer dollars overseas to fund abortions,
" said Sen. Kennedy. "
No matter who occupies the White House, America should support life at home and abroad.

The
Guaranteeing the Unborn Access to Respect and Dignity (GUARD) Act
would ensure that the United States Coast Guard is held to the same standards as every branch of the United States military with regard to the prohibition of using federal funds for abortions. This bill seeks to close a loophole that currently allows the Coast Guard, which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, to use taxpayer dollars for abortion-related activities – a practice not permitted in other military branches.
By amending Title 14 of the US Code, the GUARD Act would explicitly prohibit the use of federal funds by the Coast Guard for both the performance of abortions and for any travel expenses related to abortion procedures.
“
Preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions shouldn’t be controversial
,”
said Sen. Thune.
“
I’m proud to support this legislation that would prohibit U.S. Coast Guard funds and facilities from being used for abortions, which is a blatant overreach from the Biden administration.

Title: Lee Fires Back at Biden Gun Export Restrictions with New Bill
Date: December 18, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Rick Scott (R-FL), introduced the Protect American Gun Exporter Act. This bill comes in response to the Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) recent 90-day pause on the issuance of new export licenses for firearms, ammunition, and component parts to non-governmental end users in most foreign countries.
On October 27, 2023, without prior consultation with industry stakeholders, the BIS enacted a sweeping and unprecedented pause on export licenses—a move that Senator Lee and co-sponsors argue was unnecessary and legally questionable. This legislative action underscores the urgency to address the repercussions of the BIS’s decision, which could potentially cost the industry upwards of $90 million. The extensive economic impact threatens not only the financial stability of gun manufacturers but also the jobs of countless Americans reliant on this sector.
“
The arbitrary halt of firearm export licenses by the Biden administration lacks both justification and necessity,
"
said Sen. Lee.
"
The Protect American Gun Exporter Act guards our manufacturers against capricious policy shifts that unfairly target livelihoods simply because of industry affiliation.
”
“
Restricting the lawful export
of
firearms and related components is just another tactic to hamstring the
America
n firearms industry
,”
said Sen. Thune
. “
I’m proud to support this legislation that would protect U.S. jobs and weaken illicit arms dealers
.”
“
This administration has proved it will stop at nothing to erode the rights of people in Wyoming to keep and bear arms,
”
said Sen. Lummis.
“
This arbitrary pause is the latest example of the Biden administration’s gun-grabbing policies that seek to undermine the people of Wyoming’s constitutional rights and attack gun manufacturers. As a proud defender of our Second Amendment, I am partnering with Senator Lee to protect law-abiding citizens’ right to bear arms from this administration’s egregious and unfounded overreach
.”
“
The Biden administration continues its assault on the Second Amendment and prefers to put politics above the Constitution,
"
said Sen. Scott.
"
That’s unacceptable, and we’re here to send a message that this will not stand. I am proud to join my colleagues in sticking up for the gun manufacturers unfairly targeted by this unprecedented and unfounded action by the Biden Commerce Department. The
Protect American Gun Exporter Act
is commonsense legislation and should be enacted today
.”
“
Congress shouldn’t need a bill to ensure federal agencies do their job, yet here we are
,”
said Rep. Mark Green.
“
My Protect American Gun Exporters Act requires the Department of Commerce to do the job laid out for it by Congress, bolstering the American business community, instead of anti-gun power grabs. Law-abiding citizens should be allowed to protect themselves, and law-abiding business owners should be allowed to sell to them. I appreciate Senator Lee’s leadership and support for this in the Senate.
”
“
This unprecedented ‘pause’ on commercial firearm exports is yet another example of the Biden Administration’s attempts to make firearms commerce more difficult, and shows their disdain for the right to self-defense,
”
said Randy Kozuch, Executive Director of NRA-ILA
. “
On behalf of our millions of members, the NRA thanks Senator Lee on his efforts to curtail this bureaucratic overreach
.”
"
This move by the Biden White House is just the latest instance of their weaponization of the federal government against the
gun
industry,
"
said Gun Owners of America.
"
It's always a pleasure to collaborate with Senator Lee and his team, and we’re grateful for this bill to mitigate the imp
act
Biden’s rogue bureaucrats have had on firearm manuf
act
urers
.”
Sen. Lee’s bill seeks to:
Prohibit the Secretary of Commerce from imposing blanket pauses on new export licenses for businesses selling firearms, ammunition, and components to non-governmental end users abroad.
Prevent the Secretary from unilaterally implementing policy changes following the Commerce Department’s proposed “assessment” of current export controls on these products.
Endorsing Organizations: Heritage Action, NRA-ILA,
Gun
Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
Senator Lee believes that arbitrary administrative actions should not compromise the rights and livelihoods of Americans. The Protect American Gun Exporter Act is a move to protect American jobs, support legal business operations, and uphold the principles of due process and economic liberty.

Title: Sen. Lee Bill Puts Parents in Charge
Date: December 14, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the
Achieving Choice in
Education (ACE) Act to bolster educational choices for American families. This bill addresses growing concerns among parents about the ideological influences in public education and the economic barriers to alternative schooling options.
"
It is the fundamental right of parents to choose the educational path that is most suitable for their children,
"
said Sen. Lee.
"
The ACE Act ensures that our tax system reflects this principle and provides real support to those seeking alternatives to public schooling
."
“Across the country, and especially in Southwest Missouri, school choice is already benefitting many of our nation’s young children.”
said Rep. Burlison. "
Through 529 education saving accounts, families are freed from the arbitrary link between where they live and which school their child can attend.”
“School choice makes institutions of education more accountable and responsive to families. This leads to higher graduation rates and increases parental satisfaction and involvement while saving taxpayer dollars.”
Sen. Lee's legislation builds upon a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and enhances federal tax incentives for the enactment of state-level school choice legislation.
Key provisions of the ACE Act include:
Doubling the allowable level of tax-exempt 529 account distributions for qualified educational expenses to $20,000 per taxable year.
Gift tax exclusions up to $20,000 per year for contributions to 529 accounts.
Adjusted federal tax exemption on municipal bonds based on state school choice laws, incentivizing states to adopt such measures.
Under the ACE Act, states with no qualifying school choice laws will see the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds for local projects, such as new school construction, revoked. States that adopt school choice laws will benefit from a 50% tax exemption on bond interest income, while states fully embracing school choice will enjoy a complete tax exemption.

Title: Lee Introduces Suite of Bills to Revitalize American Ports
Date: December 8, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a series of legislative measures to bolster the United States' supply chain resilience and modernize its port infrastructure. The suite of four bills introduced by Senator Lee seeks to address long-standing impediments in the port sector and is poised to enhance the competitiveness of American maritime logistics.
"
These bills represent a critical step towards upgrading our nation's ports and securing our economic future
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
Dredging is vital for maintaining our ports and ensuring that America remains a global trade powerhouse. It's time
we update
outdated laws that hinder our progress and adopt measures that reflect the current needs of international trade and commerce.
"
Sen. Lee's legislative initiative includes the following bills:
Dredging to Ensure the Empowerment of Ports (DEEP) Act
The DEEP Act repeals the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 and proposes a new Nationwide Permit (NWP) for dredging projects. Requiring clear response times and eliminating duplication will reduce dredge backlog and provide project managers certainty in the decision-making process.

The Allied Partnership and Port Modernization Act
The Allied Partnership and Port Modernization Act aims to amend the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 to welcome NATO-affiliated dredging vessels into U.S. waters, fostering competition that can lead to reduced dredging costs and consumer prices for goods entering U.S. ports.

The Port Modernization and Supply Chain Protection Act
Building on the need for competitive dredging markets, the Port Modernization and Supply Chain Protection Act would repeal the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906's cabotage requirements, allowing any qualified dredge vessel to operate in U.S. waters. This move is expected to drive down the costs of dredging – which have risen dramatically over the past decades – and, by extension, lower the costs of goods imported into the United States.

Incentivizing the Expansion of U.S. Ports Act
To expand the U.S. dredging fleet, the Incentivizing the Expansion of U.S. Ports Act would amend the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 to allow the purchase of foreign-built dredge vessels, provided they are crewed by Americans and fly the U.S. flag. This act is a strategic move to enhance the operational capacity of American dredgers.

Of the bill,
Nick Loris
, Vice President of Public Policy at C3 Solutions said, “
Senator Lee’s dredging reform efforts are good for the economy and the environment. America’s ports are essential for bringing in the products Americans need and helping U.S. businesses export their products around the world. Regrettably, a law that predates Henry Ford’s Model T is holding back efforts to modernize domestic ports. Increasing competition for dredging activities will improve America’s ports at a lower cost to taxpayers and provide more economic opportunity for U.S. businesses. Critically, more efficient dredging generates environmental benefits by reducing congestion on the roads and restoring wetlands and beaches. Repealing the Foreign Dredge Act is long overdue.
”
Senator Lee's introduction of these bills underscores his commitment to revitalizing America's maritime infrastructure and supply chain logistics. By addressing the cost and regulatory challenges of dredging, these bills aim to position American ports to efficiently meet the growing demands of global trade.

Title: Senator Lee Introduces Act to Defund and Depart UN
Date: December 6, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act, which calls for the United States' complete withdrawal from the United Nations (UN). This legislation confronts imperative issues of national sovereignty and fiscal accountability, which have been persistent points of criticism against the United States involvement in the UN. Representative Chip Roy (R-TX 21) spearheads the companion bill in the House of Representatives.
"
No more blank checks for the United Nations. Americans' hard-earned dollars have been funneled into initiatives that fly in the face of our values –enabling tyrants, betraying allies, and spreading bigotry
,"
said Sen. Mike Lee.
"
With the DEFUND Act, we're stepping away from this debacle. If we engage with the UN in the future, it will be on our terms, with the full backing of the Senate and an iron-clad escape clause
."
Of the bill,
Rep. Chip Roy said,
“
This year, the United Nations' corruption, and its despicable, brazen political agenda have been on full display.
“
From UNRWA actively protecting Hamas and acting against our ally Israel, delayed condemning Hamas, to China being elected to the “Human Rights Council," to the propagation of climate hysteria, covering for China's forced abortion and sterilization programs, the UN's decades-old, internal rot once again raises the questions of why the United States is even still a member or why we're wasting billions — indeed, $12.5 billion in 2021 — every year on it.
“The UN doesn’t deserve one single dime of American taxpayer money or one bit of our support; we should defund it and leave immediately. I am proud to lead this critical effort alongside Mike Lee and Mike Rogers
.”
Key Elements of the DEFUND Act:
Repeals critical acts that bind the U.S. to the UN, such as the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 and the United Nations Headquarters Agreement Act.
Ceases all forms of U.S. financial support to the UN, including assessed and voluntary contributions.
Prohibits any U.S. involvement in UN peacekeeping operations.
Revokes diplomatic immunity for UN officials within the United States.
Formalizes withdrawal from the World Health Organization and other UN conventions.
Sets stringent conditions for any future engagement with the UN, requiring Senate approval with explicit withdrawal provisions.
The introduction of the DEFUND Act comes in response to years of unchecked bureaucratic expansion and financial misuse by the UN at the expense of American taxpayers. Senator Lee's legislation reflects his commitment to upholding the ideals of fiscal responsibility and self-determination that are the bedrock of the United States.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces the SCREEN Act to Protect Children from Online Pornography
Date: November 15, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee introduced the
Shielding Children's Retinas from
Egregious Exposure on the Net
(SCREEN) Act, a step toward safeguarding minors from the pervasive threat of online pornographic content. Representative Mary Miller (R-IL) spearheads the companion bill in the House of Representatives.
Despite Congress's ongoing efforts over the past three decades to shield children from online pornography, prior legislative measures have been challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds of not meeting the least restrictive means test. Nonetheless, the Court acknowledged the government's compelling interest to protect children.
Advancements in technology since the Supreme Court last addressed this matter reveal a stark reality: traditional methods like blocking and filtering software have fallen short, leaving an alarming 80% of teenagers exposed to online pornography. The repercussions on minors are profound, contributing to a spectrum of psychological issues, unhealthy sexual behaviors, and broader societal harms.
Senator Lee's SCREEN Act is a necessary evolution of the law, aligning technological progress with the government's duty to protect children. The Act mandates commercial pornographic websites to implement robust age verification technologies, providing a pragmatic and narrowly tailored solution to a complex problem.
Of the bill,
Senator Mike Lee said
, "
It is time for our laws to catch up with technology. We must ensure that as the internet grows and changes, the safety of children is not left behind. The SCREEN Act addresses the urgent need to protect minors from exposure to online pornography and stop those who profit from stealing the innocence of America's youth
."
Of the bill,
Representative Mary Miller said
, “
As a mother of seven and grandmother to 20, I am committed to defending parental rights. I am proud to join Senator Mike Lee in introducing the SCREEN Act to the House, providing parents with more control over their children's online access and protecting our kids from exposure to pornography. I urge my colleagues in the House to act swiftly in adopting the SCREEN Act to protect American children.
”
The bill has garnered support from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Culture Reframed, National Decency Coalition, Enough Is Enough, and Envoc.

Title: Lee Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Secure Privacy Protections for Americans
Date: November 7, 2023

Content:
U.S. Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., today introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Government Surveillance Reform Act, to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with important new protections for Americans’ constitutional rights.
The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., Steve Daines, R-Mont., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Cynthia Lummis, R-Wy., Jon Tester, D-Mont., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Edward Markey, D-Mass.
In the House, the bill is cosponsored by Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif.
“Americans know that it is possible to confront our country’s adversaries ferociously without throwing our constitutional rights in the trash can.  But for too long surveillance laws have not kept up with changing times.”
Wyden said.
“Our bill continues to give government agencies broad authority to collect information on threats at home and abroad, including the ability to act quickly in emergencies and settle up with the court later.  But it creates much stronger protections for the privacy of law-abiding Americans, and restores the warrant protections that are at the heart of the Fourth Amendment.”
“The FISA Court and the Director of National Intelligence have confirmed that our government conducted warrantless surveillance of millions of Americans’ private communications,”
Senator Lee said.
“It is imperative that Congress enact real reforms to protect our civil liberties, including warrant requirements and statutory penalties for privacy violations, in exchange for reauthorizing Section 702. Our bipartisan Government Surveillance Reform Act stops illegal government spying and restores the Constitutional rights of all Americans.”
“For decades, U.S. Intelligence agencies have been circumventing our 4th Amendment right to privacy by spying on Americans without a warrant. The government Surveillance Accountability Act would end abuses under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and end unauthorized surveillance programs,”
said Rep. Warren Davidson.
“It would be unwise for Members of Congress to greenlight another major surveillance reauthorization without carefully considering and enacting surveillance reform measures. For too long, federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies have had nearly unchecked access to Americans’ personal data,”
said Rep. Zoe Lofgren.
“Our bipartisan, bicameral comprehensive and calibrated legislation provides reform solutions sought for decades. With widespread support from across the political spectrum the Government Surveillance Reform Act would dramatically curb surveillance abuse and protect Americans' civil liberties, while preserving national security.”
The bill reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for 4 years, allowing intelligence agencies to continue to use the authorities granted by that law, but with key new protections against documented abuses and new accountability measures when abuses occur. It also includes a host of reforms to government surveillance authorities beyond Section 702, including requiring warrants for government purchases of private data from data brokers.
Although surveillance proponents claimed that the previous 702 reauthorization included sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse, intelligence agencies have documented extensive new violations in recent years. Abuses
include warrantless searches
for a U.S. Senator, a member of Congress, and a state court judge, among others.
The bill’s reforms include:
Protecting Americans from warrantless backdoor searches, ensuring that foreigners aren’t targeted as a pretext for spying on the Americans with whom they are communicating, and prohibiting the collection of domestic communications.
Extending similar reforms to surveillance activities under Executive Order 12333, including by limiting warrantless searches of Americans’ communications and prohibiting the targeting of foreigners as a pretext for surveilling Americans. It also limits the acquisition of Americans’ information as part of large datasets.
Requiring warrants for surveillance of Americans’ location data, web browsing and search records, including AI assistants like Alexa and Siri, vehicle data and by prohibiting the government from purchasing Americans’ data from data brokers.
Exceptions to ensure the government can continue to use Section 702 for defensive cybersecurity purposes, to assist in locating and rescuing hostages overseas and emergency provisions in cases where there isn’t sufficient time to get a warrant in advance.
The bill has been endorsed by dozens of civil society organizations:
Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), AAPI Equity Alliance, AAPI Victory Alliance, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans for Prosperity, API Equality-LA, Asian American Federal Employees for Nondiscrimination (AAFEN), Asian Texans for Justice, Aurora Commons LLC, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, Center for Democracy & Technology, Chinese for Affirmative Action, Demand Progress, Due Process Institute, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Empowering Marginalized Asian Communities, Fight for the Future, FreedomWorks, Free Press Action, Libertas Institute, Media Alliance, Muslim Advocates, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Oakland Privacy, OCA, OCA Greater Cleveland - Asian Pacific American Advocates, OCA Silicon Valley, Project for Privacy and Surveillance Accountability (PPSA), Project on Government Oversight (POGO), Restore the Fourth, Secure Justice, Stop AAPI Hate, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and X-Lab.
The bill was hailed as the most comprehensive and balanced government surveillance legislation in years, by groups across the political spectrum:
Bob Goodlatte
, former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and Senior Policy Advisor of the Project for Privacy and Surveillance Accountability (PPSA): “For far too long, the government has abused Section 702. This statute, enacted by Congress to surveil foreign threats in foreign lands, has become a tool to subject countless Americans to warrantless surveillance. The reforms in this bill ensure that our Constitutional rights will once again be respected, just as the Founders intended. PPSA appreciates this well-crafted bill – especially its tough accountability provisions. Rogue agents in the intelligence community and FBI who intentionally violate the law to spy on Americans must be held responsible.”
Sean Vitka
, Policy Director, Demand Progress: “This year represents the most significant opportunity for protecting Americans from warrantless government surveillance in generations, and the GSRA rises to the challenge. Section 702 must not be reauthorized without the critical, comprehensive privacy protections in this bill.”
Jason Pye
, Director of Rule of Law Initiatives, Due Process Institute: “Due Process Institute strongly supports the bipartisan and bicameral Government Surveillance Reform Act. For too long, arrogance prevented the intelligence apparatus and its allies in Congress from coming to the table to negotiate reforms. Now that reauthorization of Section 702 has been made difficult by the politically diverse community of advocates and lawmakers demanding commonsense to protect Americans from warrantless surveillance, the intelligence community has become more willing to listen. Unfortunately, however, they have only put forward unacceptable half measures. The Government Surveillance Reform Act is the only path forward to protect Americans from warrantless surveillance.”
John C. Yang
, President and Executive Director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC: "Asian Americans are disproportionately scrutinized as compared to other Americans in the name of ‘national security.’ When it comes to the federal government’s surveillance—whether pursuant to Section 702 of FISA or other surveillance authorities—Asian Americans are likely to be ‘incidentally’ spied on at a higher rate, simply because we have family, friends, and business associates who live abroad. This is highly concerning, given how the federal government is able to run backdoor searches through this data without a warrant. This critical bill would put in place protections and transparency mechanisms that help to regulate the collection of Americans’ sensitive communications, and reign in the likely greater impact that such existing authorities have on communities of color."
James Czerniawski,
Senior policy Analyst, Americans for Prosperity: “The U.S. intelligence community has frequently misused its authorities under FISA, including Section 702, as well as other surveillance powers, eroding trust in institutions responsible for Americans' safety. Protecting our constitutional rights and national security are not mutually exclusive goals. The Government Surveillance Reform Act is a critical step toward restoring trust, protecting constitutional rights, and maintaining public safety. We commend Senators Wyden and Lee, along with Representatives Davidson and Lofgren for their leadership in advancing this important legislation.”

The bill’s bipartisan, bicameral co-sponsors praised the introduction:
“Freedom and privacy are bedrock Montana values, and no DC bureaucrat or government agency should be able to access Montanans’ personal information without a warrant,”
said Sen. Jon Tester
. “My bipartisan bill will slam shut dangerous loopholes to ensure that government can’t intrude on Montanans’ personal lives and help folks across the Treasure State rest easy knowing their Constitutional rights won’t be violated.”
“Federal intelligence agencies have access to powerful surveillance tools that help protect our national security from foreign threats – but these tools too often violate Americans’ privacy rights,”
said Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
“This bill will rein in these abuses and reform FISA’s Section 702 to protect Americans from mass, warrantless surveillance.”
“Americans have a constitutional right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures that is nonnegotiable,”
said Sen. Steve Daines.
“As the federal government is increasingly sticking it’s nose into Americans’ private conversations and records, we must put an end to illegitimate searches and protect this fundamental right.”
“Americans have a constitutional right to privacy, but Section 702 has been used to violate that right hundreds
of thousands of times. That is why we cannot reauthorize FISA without a major overhaul,”
said Rep. Pramila Jayapal
. “I’m proud to join Senator Wyden and Representatives Davidson
and Lofgren in leading this legislation to ensure that the right to privacy is protected for all people.”
“For decades, our intelligence agencies have offered us a false choice: either keep our country safe or protect Americans’ constitutional right to privacy. But we can and must do both,” said
Rep. Sara Jacobs
. “Yet, Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
has enabled the warrantless collection of Americans’ activities – from phone calls and website searches to emails and location data – with too little oversight and accountability. That’s why I’m so proud to co-lead the bipartisan and bicameral
Government Surveillance Reform Act
, which gives our intelligence agencies the necessary tools to combat terrorism, safeguards Americans’ rights, and ensures robust oversight. This is the framework we need to protect our country and uphold our values.”
“Adding these privacy safeguards to FISA will ensure our civil liberties are protected without sacrificing national security. We have learned the hard way that unchecked surveillance is a violation of our right to privacy. I strongly support comprehensive overhaul of FISA with the Government Surveillance Reform Act, and urge my colleagues to put their constituents first and do the same,”
said Rep. Barbara Lee.
“Unwarranted and unchecked surveillance violates our constitutional rights,”
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett.
“By providing essential reforms to encompass new technological developments in an ever-changing landscape, this legislation recognizes that ensuring our national security need not require trampling individual liberties.”
“As new technologies emerge, we must ensure Americans’ data privacy is protected,”
said Rep. Ted Lieu.
“I’m pleased to co-author the bipartisan and bicameral Government Surveillance Reform Act, a comprehensive package of key reforms that strike an important balance between defending Americans’ civil liberties while protecting our national security. I’m also glad to see our Cell-Site Simulator Warrant Act and key provisions from our Government Surveillance Transparency Act included in the legislation.”
"Since its passage in 2008, FISA's Section 702 has been used by federal law enforcement to access sensitive information about people in the United States without a warrant, including their communications and location information, that is otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment,”
said Rep. Judy Chu
. “As Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I am particularly concerned about the disproportionate impact Section 702 of FISA has on Asian Americans and members of the Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian, or AMEMSA, communities, who have been subject to Section 702 ‘backdoor searches’ simply because we have family, friends, and business associates in foreign countries. Racial profiling in the name of ‘national security’ has historically upended countless innocent lives, and that is why I joined as an original cosponsor of the Government Surveillance Reform Act, which would put in place much-needed, commonsense reforms to Section 702 that would protect the rights of Americans while preserving national security.”

Title: Lee Moves to Preserve Internet Freedom with Updated Bill
Date: October 28, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
- In a continued effort to prioritize fast, affordable Internet access for all Americans, Senator Lee introduced an updated version of the "Restoring Internet Freedom Act." This move comes in response to recent efforts by the FCC to revert to regulations reminiscent of dated telephone services.
A brief history:
In 2015, the FCC shifted Internet service regulations, likening them to early 1900s telephone services. The aftermath of this change witnessed a notable drop in broadband infrastructure improvements. Recognizing the setback, Senator Lee introduced the original "Restoring Internet Freedom Act" in 2016 and 2017.
Senator Lee's efforts and subsequent actions by the FCC, which included the repeal of the Open Internet Order, placed regulations of the internet under the more lenient Title I. Following this shift in regulatory approach, there was a notable increase in broadband investment, Internet speed, and deployment, while costs for consumers lowered.
Now, with the FCC's recent proposal to reintroduce stricter regulations, Senator Lee's updated actaims to ensure continued progress in Internet infrastructure and maintain its current growth trajectory.
Key Highlights of the Bill:
Nullification of FCC's New Proposal
: The FCC's recent rule proposal will be prohibited from being adopted or nullified (if the bill is passed after adoption of the proposed rule).
Prevention of Similar Future Proposals:
The FCC will be restricted from reintroducing this rule, or any rule similar to it, without a specific new law permitting them to do so.
Clear Definition:
The bill provides a specific definition for "rule", referencing section 804 of Title 5 USC.

Title: Lee Bill Seeks to Protect Utah’s Historic Roads
Date: October 26, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the
Historic Roadways
Protection
Act
to safeguard roads that were vital in shaping Utah's rich pioneer history. This bill comes as a response to the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) recent decision to close 317 miles of roads in Utah, including many that have significant historical value.
Of the bill,
Senator Lee stated
, "
These roads aren't just pathways; they're a testament to Utah's rich history and the pioneers who shaped our state. It's crucial that we ensure their protection for future generations
."
Key Points:
Historical Roads
: An 1866 law allowed for the creation of roads on public lands to help with western settlements. These historically important roads remained even after Congress updated the law in 1976. Today, 317 miles of such roads are at risk of closure by the BLM, including 114 miles with historical value.
Legal Actions
: 22 counties in Utah are currently in court, advocating for the protection of these heritage roads. Given the volume of roads under discussion and the importance of the outcome, the Historic Roadways Protection Act proposes a halt on any road closures until these cases have been decided.
Bill Specifics
: Senator Lee's bill prohibits using federal money to enact new travel plans in Utah until all the historic road cases have been settled. Additionally, Sen. Lee's legislation pauses any previous plans by the BLM to change how these lands are used until the courts reach a decision on the old roads.

Title: Bridging the Housing Gap in the West
Date: October 24, 2023

Content:
The Vision of Sen. Mike Lee's HOUSES Act
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Helping Open Underutilized Space to Ensure Shelter or HOUSES Act legislation aimed at alleviating housing constraints experienced across the West. This initiative targets federal lands to bolster local efforts to combat rising housing costs and increase available housing stock.
Over the last few years, housing prices in Utah have dramatically increased, with average home prices skyrocketing since 2015. A significant contributor to this scarcity is the federal ownership of vast tracts of land. The federal government controls over two-thirds of the land in Utah, limiting the available space for residential development and driving up costs for the limited amount of available, developable land. Coupled with historic inflation, rising housing prices make life less affordable for Western families.
The HOUSES Act aims to rectify this by:
Offering small parcels of federal land for purchase to states or local government entities at a PILT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) ratioed price.
Ensuring that these lands are primarily used for housing purposes with a mandate of at least 85% of the land being dedicated for residential purposes and the community's related needs.
Establishing density requirements, ensuring a minimum of four homes per acre.
Prohibiting the development of luxury second homes on these parcels, thereby focusing on affordability.
Protecting certain areas, the act explicitly excludes lands with special designations, such as national monuments, wilderness areas, or national recreation areas, from being nominated.
Co-sponsors of this bill include Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Dan Sullivan (R-AK). The bill is endorsed by the National Association of Counties (NACO).
"
The unprecedented challenges we face in housing affordability and availability need innovative solutions. With the HOUSES Act, we can leverage federally owned land to significantly address these challenges, especially in states like Utah where federal land ownership is extensive
,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
Utah's heart and soul lie in its communities and families. The HOUSES Act recognizes every Utahn, and every American, deserves a place to call home
."
Of the bill,
Sen. Barrasso said
, “
Housing affordability is a nationwide problem. Rent is high and mortgages are even higher thanks to Bidenomics. The HOUSES Act will provide new options to state and local governments by allowing them to buy certain lands from the federal government for residential purposes. As more people move to Wyoming, growing communities need options to expand housing
.”
Of the bill, President & CEO of Salt Lake Chamber,
Derek Miller
said
, "
Senator Lee's proactive approach to addressing Utah's affordable housing crisis at the federal level is commendable. As housing affordability is a top policy issue for the Salt Lake Chamber, we applaud his relentless efforts to find effective solutions and strategies that will make homeownership a reality for more Utahns. This commitment to Utah's well-being is a testament to his dedication and leadership.
"
Of the bill, Executive Director of the Vernal Area Chamber,
David O’Riordan
said
, “
Communities across the country, especially in the West, are grappling with significant housing affordability and availability challenges. The current shortage of homes has led to soaring housing prices, impacting many families. Senator Lee's proposal to increase the available area for housing development is a crucial step in addressing this issue. By allowing communities to have more flexibility in addressing their unique housing needs, this legislation can make a substantial positive impact
.”
Of the bill, President & CEO of the Cedar City Chamber of Commerce,
Christopher M. McCormick said
, "
The Cedar City Chamber of Commerce stands in support of the HOUSES Act and urges our legislators to implement this as expeditiously as possible. This is not only a good plan for Utah, but the nation as a whole, as this is becoming a nationwide problem
."
Of the bill, President & CEO of Point of the Mountain Chamber,
Mark Welcker
said
, "
The dream of owning a home in Utah County is on the verge of becoming unattainable for many of Utah Counties would-be homeowners. With current growth trends, it is anticipated that Utah County will add 1 million additional residents over the next several decades putting Utah County on par with Salt Lake County. Unless we take immediate action, the lack of inventory and skyrocketing home prices will crush the hopes and dreams of many Utahns who want to live in Utah County and along the Wasatch Front. Senator Mike Lee’s HOUSES Act will certainly help to create a pathway for home ownership.
"
Of the bill,
Washington City Mayor and City Council
said
, “
The median home price in Washington County hit $520,000 in September of 2023. Housing is quickly becoming unaffordable and unattainable for many of our residents. We need to find solutions that will allow the middle class to thrive in Washington City. We appreciate Senator Lee bringing forward the HOUSES Act, a bill that will give municipalities another avenue through which they can increase the supply of more affordable housing. We support this concept as one way to alleviate pressure on the housing market. We look forward to working with partners in the private sector and at all levels of government to address our critical housing needs.”
Of the bill, Mayor of Leeds, Utah
,
Bill Hoster said
, “
Senator Lee's bill demonstrates a deep understanding of the multifaceted nature of our housing crisis, o?ering a comprehensive solution that embraces the variety of needs across di?erent communities. By increasing the available area for housing development of all kinds – from low-income housing and apartments to condominiums and single-family homes – this bill paves the way for a future where everyone can find a place to safely and a?ordably call home
.”
Of the bill, Utah County Commissioner
Brandon Gordon said
, “
The HOUSES Act helps us to prepare and plan for growth, It’s happening, we must plan, mitigate the bad effects and ensure we use the benefits to make a stronger Utah County.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill Protecting Children from Gender Transition Research
Date: October 5, 2023

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act, a bill prohibiting federal funding of gender transition research on minors.  Medical interventions to transition gender are experimental, irreversible, and often fail to produce the intended effects of improving patients’ mental health.  This bill would prohibit federal funding from being used in research or publications that seek to establish or affirm gender identities that are incongruent with a minor’s biological sex.
Sen. Lee is joined by Sens. James Lankford(R-OH), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Braun (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The Federal Government should never fund research that harms kids.  This bill will protect taxpayers from funding spurious research, but more importantly, it will protect kids from the permanent damage this irresponsible research can produce
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Tuberville said
, “
Children are not capable of giving full consent to irreversible, life-altering elective surgery,” Coach Tuberville said. “Subjecting healthy, developing children to damaging and harmful procedures without a grave medical purpose is absolutely wrong, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to pay for these extreme and reckless practices
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Rubio said, “
This is common sense legislation. Taxpayer dollars should not be funding reckless experiments that cause irreversible harm to children.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Hawley said
,
“
These procedures—which are often irreversible and sterilizing to children—are absolutely sickening. Federal taxpayers should never be footing the bill for child abuse. Congress must act to protect children across this nation from these abusive treatments.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Daines said,
“
In Montana, we let boys be boys and girls be girls. Taxpayers should never be forced to fund and promote research of harmful, irreversible procedures on children
.”
Of the bill
, Kristan Hawkins President of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action said
, "
Students for Life Action will always stand for children, born and preborn, protecting them from the harmful abortion industry and their new moneymaker, sterilizing drugs and surgeries. The sterilization and abortion industry doesn't care what happens to children, as long as they never hold a child of their own. The Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act would protect children from this growing industry that is anti-child and anti-life. Students for Life Action stands with Senator Lee and the Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act.

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Roy Team Up to repeal the FACE Act
Date: October 4, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Representative Chip Roy (R-TX-21) introduced legislation to repeal the unconstitutional and easily weaponized Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act or FACE Act.
The FACE Act is a federal law designed to protect access to abortion facilities. While FACE also includes protections for churches, these are duplicative of other federal and state laws and have never been enforced.
President Biden’s weaponized Department of Justice has used the FACE Act to legally harass peaceful pro-life activists while simultaneously stonewalling good faith efforts by members of Congress to conduct even elementary oversight of the law.
Last year, the FACE Act made national news when pro-life activist Mark Houck was arrested by dozens of FBI agents citing the FACE Act in relation to a pushing incident outside of an abortion facility. After deliberating for less than an hour, a jury would later find Mr. Houck innocent. Most recently, several members of the left-wing organization Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising were found guilty of violating FACE following a peaceful protest at a Washington D.C. abortion provider.
Supporting organizations include Thomas More Society, Family Research Council, Students for Life Action, Catholic Vote, Susan B. Anthony List, Live Action, and Citizens for Renewing America.
Of the bill,
Senator Lee said,
“Our Constitution reserved general police power to the states. Congress infringed on the states’ police power when they passed the FACE Act. The Biden DOJ has weaponized this constitutionally suspect law against pro-life sidewalk counselors while failing to protect pregnancy centers and churches from violent attacks. It’s time to repeal the FACE Act.”
Of the bill,
Representative Roy said,
“
Free Americans should never live in fear of their government targeting them because of their beliefs. Yet, Biden's Department of Justice has brazenly weaponized the FACE Act against normal, everyday Americans across the political spectrum, simply because they are pro-life. Our Constitution separates power between the federal government and the states for a reason, and we ignore that safeguard at our own peril.
The FACE Act is an unconstitutional federal takeover of state police powers; it must be repealed.
”
Of the bill,
Tom McClusky, Director of Government Affairs of CatholicVote said
, “
The Biden administration has taken weaponization of government to a new level - his weapon of choice against pro-lifers has been the FACE Act, which has been mainly used to target peaceful prolife activists who stand up for the unborn. Rep. Roy and Sen. Lee are right to take this weapon away from Joe Biden and restore the First Amendment right to peacefully protest
."
Of the bill, Kristan Hawkins, President of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action said
, “
It’s clear that the Biden Administration has used the FACE Act as a tool for aggressive pro-abortion partisans to take cases of alleged crimes, federalize them, and add the full weight of the government’s support for abortion to the ire against individuals. SFLAction is calling for repeal of the FACE Act and fully supports Rep. Chip Roy's FACE Act Repeal Act of 2023, as it is a long overdue course correction needed to reign in a weaponized Department of Justice.
”
The bill was co-sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), J.D. Vance (R-OH), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO).
Co-sponsors of the legislation in the House of Representatives include Reps. Chip Roy, Chris Smith, Bob Good, Andrew Clyde, Jim Banks, Doug LaMalfa, Mary Miller, Diana Harshbarger, Debbie Lesko, Brian Babin, Andy Biggs, James Moylan, Ken Buck, Warren Davidson, Alex Mooney, Anna Paulina Luna, Paul Gosar, Matt Rosendale, Josh Brecheen, Barry Moore, Keith Self, Eric Burlison, Doug Lamborn and Jeff Duncan.
Background:
The FACE Act is a federal law designed to protect access to abortion facilities. While FACE also includes protections for churches, these are duplicative of other federal and state laws and have never been enforced.
Prior to this year, the FACE Act had never been used to indict individuals related to an attack on a pro-life pregnancy center.  It has still never been used by the federal government to protect a house of worship.
Since the Dobbs decision was leaked in May of 2020, at least 357 Catholic Churches have been attacked. The Biden Administration has opened 0 FACE Act cases in response.
Congress originally claimed that the Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment Due Process Clause granted it the power to enact the FACE Act. The Constitution does not grant the federal government general police power. In Dobbs, the Supreme Court found that abortion is not a constitutional right. Pro-life “protest” and sidewalk counseling are not commercial activities.

Title: Lee Introduces Define the Mission Act
Date: September 28, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), J.D. Vance (R-OH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Mike Braun (R-IN), introduced the Define the Mission Act, legislation that will provide the American people clarity and transparency on U.S. engagement in Ukraine. The Act requires the President to submit a comprehensive strategy on U.S. involvement in Ukraine to Congress within 30 days of enactment. A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH, 8th District).
“As long as it takes” remains the mantra of the Biden administration when asked how long the U.S. will remain engaged in support of Ukraine. With $113 billion already provided and an additional $24 billion request on the horizon, the American taxpayer needs clarity on our objectives and how continued U.S. support furthers our national interests.
The Define the Mission Act stipulates the required strategy must include:
A clear definition of the U.S. national interests at stake.
An estimation of the resources required, including U.S. personnel, materials, and funding.
A forecast of security assistance to be received from NATO allies within the upcoming year.
A thorough assessment of the impact of Russia's dominance in the European natural gas market on concluding the conflict in Ukraine.
Furthermore, the proposed strategy cannot be contingent on the U.S. providing funds for Ukrainian reconstruction.
"
The Biden administration's 'as long as it takes' approach to Ukraine is unacceptable, and frankly, not a strategy
,"
said Sen. Lee.
"
Before we spend another penny on Ukraine, the administration owes Congress and the American people a plan of action. This bill requires the Biden administration to put pen to paper and define our goal in Ukraine.
"
“
The Ukraine proxy war is the Washington war hawk regime’s latest obsession
,”
said Rep. Davidson.
“
The Biden administration’s ‘as long as it takes’ approach is not a substitute for a clear strategy. It’s our responsibility to demand a defined mission on behalf of the American people and get concrete answers to avoid endless war.
”
Without a clear strategy, the United States risks repeating past errors seen in prolonged engagements. The
Define the Mission Act
is a call for responsible governance, strategic foresight, and a commitment to prevent waste and potential misuse of resources.
Sen. Lee's bill underscores the urgency for a defined strategy that seeks to achieve a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine and places America's national interests at the forefront.

Title: Lee Urges Prompt Repayment to Utah Amid Shutdown Concerns
Date: September 27, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, underscoring the importance of Utah's National Parks and the potential repercussions of a government shutdown on these iconic spaces and the local economy.
Sen. Lee's letter emphasizes the prompt reimbursement of any state funds used to maintain National Parks during a shutdown. Sen. Lee stressed the significance of ensuring continued access and services to these parks, urging Sec. Haaland to utilize the provisions of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) to fund essential park operations with entrance fee dollars, a procedure that was utilized during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.
Additionally, in the event that the State of Utah is forced to expend state funds to keep our National Parks open during a shutdown, Sen. Lee urged Sec. Haaland to repay the state for costs incurred upon the government reopening.

Title: Lee Bill Simplifies Labeling of American-Made Products
Date: September 27, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Angus King (I-ME) introduced the Reinforcing American-Made Products Act, which sets a national standard for interstate commerce products to be labeled "Made-in-USA.”  Currently, businesses must navigate conflicting federal and state definitions and regulatory requirements to label products as “Made-in-USA.”  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an existing national definition that does not supersede state requirements under current laws.  Sen. Lee’s bill will simplify and standardize this type of product labeling and allow the countless businesses that already qualify under the federal definition to sell their products as “Made in USA” nationwide.
Of the bill’s introduction,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Businesses are proud to make their products in the United States.  The current labeling environment prevents countless businesses and products from receiving the recognition they deserve. This bill makes sure businesses have an incentive to produce here at home
.”
“
When a consumer sees a ‘Made in the USA’ label, they know they’re purchasing a high-quality product and supporting American jobs
,”
said Sen. King.
“
The
Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would ensure that a ‘Made in the USA’ label is a simple, straightforward way to help consumers make informed decisions about the products they intend to buy. Thank you to Senator Lee for working with me to support American manufacturers and streamline this process for consumers who want to support American workers
.”
Richard Hendrickson
, President and CEO of Lifetime Products, a Utah business that makes its products in America, said of the bill, “
We want to mark our products, “Made in USA,” so we roll our own tubing, we then do all the welding, the punching, the painting, the packaging.  And yet, there came a time that we were actually sued for putting “Made in USA” on these basketball hoops.  To not have a consistent definition of “Made in USA” is insensible. Our ability to mark our products “Made in USA” matters.  Senator Lee’s support helps us create jobs, opportunities, and bless families’ lives.

Title: Senator Lee Takes on Monument Overreach
Date: September 14, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), alongside Sens. Jim Risch (R-ID), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Mitt Romney (R-UT), introduced legislation to reform the Antiquities Act of 1906 to ensure more transparent and accountable designations of national monuments. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, M.D. (R-IA 1
st
District) and John Curtis (R-UT 3
rd
District) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
Since its inception, the Antiquities Act has been a tool to protect archaeological resources on public lands. Over the years, however, there have been instances where the Act's broad language has been used to unilaterally designate vast amounts of public land as national monuments without sufficient public input or Congressional oversight.
"
The text of the Antiquities Act was clear – to protect significant archaeological and historic sites, but to do so with discretion and to ensure that the designated area was confined to the smallest size necessary for their protection
,"
Sen. Lee said.
"
Regrettably, we have seen designations that far exceed this directive, impacting millions of acres and the lives of many in the West.
My bill aspires to bring clarity and balance to this process, honoring both our historic legacy and the voices of affected communities.
"
“
We must preserve the use of federal lands for responsible recreational, agricultural and energy use
,” said
Rep. Miller-Meeks, M.D.
“
For years the Obama and Biden administrations used the Antiquities Act to institutionalize massive executive overreach, seizing acres and acres of land without consequence. In some congressional districts, almost 80% of rural land is set aside as public or federal land. The Congressional Oversight of the Antiquities Act would curb executive overreach and require the administration to consult Congress before making rash decisions about our federal lands
.”
“
It is abundantly clear Congress must prevent more abuses by the Antiquities Act that go against the will of impacted communities
,”
said Rep. John Curtis
. “
There is no question we can protect our public lands, but that should only be done with broad buy-in and collaboration. This legislation will ensure proper accountability and sustainability of our shared lands
.”
The bill highlights instances like the designation of the Grand-Staircase-Escalante National Monument under President Clinton and the Bears Ears National Monument under President Obama. Both monuments cover millions of acres. Most recently, President Biden's establishment of a 917,600-acre monument in northern Arizona further underscores the necessity for reform.
Beyond the conservation implications, the broad designations have had real-world economic consequences for local communities. Ranching, farming, mining, and timber harvesting – all vital economic drivers for western communities – are often disrupted or halted entirely due to land-use restrictions.
Sen. Lee’s bill has received endorsements by the American Farm Bureau Foundation, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, Public Lands Council, American Forest Resource Council, and Federal Forest Resource Coalition.

Title: Lee Amendment to NDAA Passes Senate
Date: July 28, 2023

Content:
Amendment Prioritizes Legal Protections for Troops Abroad
WASHINGTON
– The Senate adopted Sen. Mike Lee's (R-UT) amendment to the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which requires the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to review the ten countries with the largest U.S. armed forces presence and provide an assessment of the protections our servicemembers receive under the bilateral Status of Forces Agreements we hold with each country.
Lt. Ridge Alkonis's
tragic experience
highlights the potential hardships and heartache that can arise due to the lack of clarity on legal rights and processes under foreign law. In response to such circumstances, the Senate's adoption of Sen. Mike Lee's (R-UT) amendment to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is a vital step towards ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform receive the fair and just legal treatment they deserve while serving their country overseas.
On the passage of his amendment,
Sen. Lee said
, "
We have an obligation to ensure our brave men and women in uniform are afforded basic legal protections. This amendment is our commitment to guaranteeing that their legal treatment is fair and just, consistent with the rights they would have under U.S. law. Congress should not allow anything less.”
"
The passage of this amendment
,"
Sen. Lee added,
"
affirms to our troops and their families that Congress is committed to getting our Status of Forces Agreements right. We will continue to address these challenges with our allies, ensuring our agreements provide the fair and just legal treatment our servicemembers deserve

Title: Lee, Roy Introduce the HERO Act
Date: July 27, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) Act, a bill that brings transparency, accountability, and competition to higher education. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) sponsored the HERO Act in the House of Representatives.
The HERO Act aims to simplify federal student loans by offering a single option and introduces a new financial "skin-in-the-game" requirement for universities. Under this requirement, universities will be rewarded for each Pell Grant graduate but will also be obliged to repay a percentage of the total loans issued, with consideration for loan default rates and the average national unemployment rate.
Moreover, the bill empowers states to establish alternative accreditation systems that can accredit any postsecondary institution offering programs applicable to degrees, credentials, or professional certifications. This flexibility allows states to determine clock hour and minimum program length requirements, making short-term workforce development programs and nontraditional educational providers eligible for federal student aid.
Additionally, the HERO Act mandates higher education institutions participating in federal student loan programs to publish relevant outcome information in an easily accessible format. This transparency provides students with the necessary information to make informed decisions about which institutions to attend.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
Too often, our bright young minds needlessly face the unfair choice of either drowning in debt or sacrificing their dreams of higher education. The HERO Act aims to alleviate the ever-increasing financial burden required of students pursuing their educational goals by capping loans that exacerbate costs. It would transform our educational landscape and allow students to tailor their unique learning journey and gain the skills needed to excel in today's dynamic economy
.”
Of the bill,
Rep. Chip Roy said
, “
Higher "education" in America has largely become a crony government-supported credentialing racket more interested in political indoctrination than pursuing truth or preparing Americans for the workforce.
The more involved the federal bureaucracy has become with education, the worse and more expensive things have gotten.
Enough. It's time for schools to have skin in the game for how much debt they encourage young Americans to rack up. It's time to start getting the feds out of the college business, and put states and students back in charge. That is why I'm proud to work with my good friend Mike Lee in introducing this critical first step toward that goal.
”
Of the bill,
Ryan Walker, Acting Executive Director of Heritage Action, said,
“
While the quality of higher education in the United States has diminished, the cost of going to college has skyrocketed. Federal education subsidies incentivize colleges and universities to repeatedly increase tuition without worrying about the return on investment they provide to students. This has left millions of Americans saddled with more debt than the earning potential their degree provides. Rather than double down on failed policies, like President Biden’s reckless and unfair student loan amnesty proposals that would only make the problem worse, Congress should reform the Higher Education Act to create a new incentive structure that puts students first. Senator Mike Lee’s Higher Education Reform (HERO) Act does just that by ensuring that prospective students have the information and support they need to make informed decisions about their future. The HERO Act would also encourage innovation and reward institutions that provide the best return on investment for students. Senator Lee should be commended for putting forward a serious plan for creating a more sustainable higher education system in the United States.
”
Of the bill,
Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer, Americans for Prosperity
,
said
, “
For far too long, Washington bureaucrats dictated the types of education students could pursue while government policies rewarded costly education models with billions in federal subsidies that led to out-of-control college costs. The HERO Act is a necessary and important step to reduce the influence the federal government and Washington bureaucrats have on postsecondary education. This legislation empowers states and postsecondary education providers of all types to work together and spur bottom-up solutions that deliver high-value, low-cost education options
.”
Of the bill,
Alfredo Ortiz, President & CEO of Job Creators Network, said,
"
The Job Creators Network supports the 'Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act' introduced today by Senator Mike Lee. The HERO Act would make important reforms to the federal student loan program to address the root causes of skyrocketing college tuition costs. Not only would it limit the amount future students could borrow, but it also would hold America's colleges and universities accountable by requiring them to repay an annual fine based on the overall amount of outstanding federal student loans with delinquent payments. JCN also appreciates the important transparency and accreditation reforms in the Act. As the organization that challenged President Biden's illegal student loan bailout on behalf of two private plaintiffs, we have consistently argued that the real solution to the student loan crisis includes holding colleges and universities accountable and providing students with the tools they need to make thoughtful decisions about whether and how much to borrow for college. The HERO Act would go a long way in doing just that. JCN urges all Senators to support this important legislation.

Title: Lee to Media: End the Killer Fame Game
Date: July 19, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
- Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) introduced a resolution urging the media to engage in responsible and voluntary journalistic practices to deny mass public murderers the attention they seek and to minimize the potential 'media contagion effect' caused by sensationalistic reporting. The resolution aims to encourage a more balanced and ethical approach to reporting on violent incidents and to play a role in preventing the incitement of further acts of mass violence.
Of the resolution,
Sen. Mike Lee said
, “
By refusing to give mass murderers the attention they desire, we can effectively combat the 'media contagion effect' that fuels more violence. Research shows that such irresponsible coverage can ignite violence and perpetuate a dangerous cycle of copycat killers. To break this pattern, we must advocate for a more balanced and ethical approach to reporting violent incidents, denying these cowardly perpetrators the spotlight they crave and ultimately preventing future occurrences of mass murder.”
“There is an epidemic of evil people motivated by perverse beliefs to wreak havoc on the lives of innocent people. Just a few short months ago, the Covenant School in Nashville was robbed of six precious lives in a horrific act of violence. The media was quick to report on the incident, combing for every gritty detail that could be uncovered about the shooter and her motivation,”
said Congressman Ogles
. “This resolution simply asks the media to do their work responsibly and stop sensationalizing the despicable acts of mass murderers. Several studies have indicated that a ‘media contagion effect’ may be increasing the possibility of similar future tragedies. The media covers suicides with much more care due to the sensitive nature of the issue, and they ought to do the same for instances of public mass murderers. This Resolution offers suggestions to that end, and I thank Senator Lee for his leadership in leading this charge in the Senate.”
Dr. Jordan Peterson
echoes this crucial perspective, stating, “
We could choose, as a society, to make mass shootings exceedingly rare, as they once were. However, doing so will require the press—and anyone else who has the attention of a wide swath of the public —to withhold from the mass shooters what they all desperately and murderously desire: fame.
“As a practicing clinical and research psychologist--and as someone who has studied the darkest recesses of the human psyche for forty years--I can state with near certainty that wannabe mass shooters would cease wreaking havoc on the innocent and society at large if we stopped rewarding them with the notoriety they will sacrifice anything to attain.
“The approach outlined in the resolutions introduced by Senator Lee and Representative Ogles would, if followed, make mass shootings a thing of the past."
Aidan Johnston, Federal Affairs Director for Gun Owners of America said,
"The media loves to sensationalize mass murders because, by and large, it helps them drive home their preferred narrative: guns and gun owners are to blame for the very violence they are covering. Often times, they pathetically fail to even try and hide their biased viewpoint on the matter. Research confirms that this irresponsible practice plays a role in motivating other individuals to commit mass violence. This documented 'media contagion effect' is real, and encouraging the media to voluntarily adopt more stringent ethical practices industry-wide can play a significant role in reducing these copycat attacks on society at-large. We thank Senator Lee and Rep. Ogles for leading the charge on this resolution."

Title: Lee Seeks Increased Competition in Biological Drug Market
Date: July 13, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
- Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Mike Braun (R-IN), and J.D. Vance (R-OH) introduced the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act to increase competition within the biological drug market and increase access to low-cost prescription drugs.
For small-molecule drugs, pharmacists can substitute generics in lieu of their branded counterparts. Access to generics is essential to increasing competition and bringing down the cost of prescription drugs for patients.
The generic equivalent of a biological drug is known as a biosimilar. Unlike generic drugs, many states will not allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar unless the FDA declares it to be “interchangeable.” The current process is cumbersome and expensive.
Under current regulations, acquiring interchangeable status requires the product to undergo switching studies - whereby participants must alternate between the biologic and the biosimilar – over and above the initial approval as a biosimilar. These studies can cost millions of dollars and further delay market access. After examining 15 years of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently stated that switching studies are unnecessary for biosimilars to obtain interchangeable status.
Sen. Lee’s bill would deem biosimilars as interchangeable with their branded equivalent upon their approval by the FDA. It also allows for use of switching studies in special circumstances. Eliminating the barrier of interchangeability would increase access to lower cost biosimilars and save payers and consumers billions over the next five years. It also allows for use of switching studies in special circumstances. Eliminating the barrier of interchangeability would increase access to lower cost biosimilars and save payers and consumers billions over the next five years.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Our current regulatory environment imposes onerous and costly burdens that hinder the entry of biosimilars into the market. Ultimately, it's the patients who bear the brunt of limited competition and exorbitant drug prices. We owe it to them to break down these barriers and ensure they have timely access to these life-changing drugs.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Lujan said
, “
Utilizing more biosimilar drugs will benefit patients and lower drug costs. But access is often limited because of the unique drawn-out process. This bipartisan legislation will streamline the approval process while maintaining patient safety and effectiveness. This change will help increase competition in the marketplace to ensure more patients and their families have access to medication that help treat diseases and other chronic conditions.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Braun said,
“
When there’s a lack of competition in the market, it’s the patients that suffer. In the Senate, I’ve been committed to expanding transparency and competition in the healthcare industry and this legislation would save Americans money by making sure that more biosimilars make it to market
.”
Read support for the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act below:
The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) – President and CEO James Gelfand
“
On behalf of The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC), representing the largest employers in the country, thank you for introducing the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act.  This bill will unlock a barrier to much-needed FDA approvals of biosimilars, which hold the promise to provide access to quality medicines at affordable costs. ERIC has long-supported enhanced access to biosimilars to address increasing drug costs and the burden they carry on employers and their employees. This bill makes a commonsense change in law to hopefully open the ability of the FDA to expeditiously approve more biosimilars to bring to market, ultimately benefiting millions of American workers and their families.  ERIC strongly supports this bill and thanks Senators Lee and Luján for introducing the bill
.”
Americans for Prosperity – Charlie Katebi, Senior Health Policy Analyst
“
Increasing generic alternatives empowers patients by creating lower cost options in the marketplace .says Charlie Katebi, Senior Health Policy Analyst, Americans For Prosperity. The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act delivers this solution by removing unnecessary barriers, increasing the availability of lower cost generic biosimilar drugs, and providing patients a Personal Option for their prescriptions.
”
Lower Drug Prices Now- Margarida Jorge, Campaign Director
“
Biosimilars are an important part of lowering the cost of prescription drugs and are on track to save Americans tens of billions of dollars over the next five years. This bill by Senators Lujan and Lee will help cut red tape and safely bring more of these medications to market to create competition and lower prices.  We are proud to endorse and hope Congress will act on this vital legislation.
”
Prof. Dr. Sarfaraz Niazi
“
Prof. Dr. Sarfaraz K. Niazi, an expert on biosimilars with many peer-reviewed published papers and dozens of books on the subject of biosimilars, 100+ US patents, and multiple FDA-approved biosimilars, has also advised regulatory agencies and contributed to the amendment of the BPCIA to remove “animal toxicology” from the legislation.  According to Prof. Niazi, “an interchangeable status is given to a biosimilar after confirming that it has “no clinically meaningful difference, with the referenced product; it is difficult enough to demonstrate differences in clinical response between a biosimilar and its reference product, let alone to reconfirm it, an exercise that will require hundreds of thousands of patients to meet the FDA-required statistical criteria. As a result, none of these studies can ever fail. The safety issue in interchangeability testing is already resolved when biosimilars are approved. It is a sheer waste of resources and abuse of patients; it only helps large companies who can spend hundreds of millions of dollars to claim the superiority of their biosimilar product. EMA and MHRA allow interchangeability with the reference and other biosimilar products.”
BioUtah
“
BioUtah recognizes the aim of the
“
Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act” to speed patient access to life-changing, lower-cost biosimilars by addressing regulatory inefficiencies. The legislation provides an avenue for discussion of the current U.S. interchangeability designation and how federal policy may impact the availability of biosimilars and affect costs to consumers. With a strong biopharma sector, Utah has led the nation in job growth in the life sciences industry since 2012, providing more than 42,000 jobs at more than 1,800 companies and generating $13 billion in GDP. Companies in our state are working to develop better treatments and new cures for devastating disease, such as cancer, MS, ALS and more. We appreciate the leadership of the bill
’
s sponsors, Senator Lee and Senator Lujan, in seeking to examine a more flexible pathway to market. We also look forward to working with the Senators and stakeholders to strike the right balance in advancing access to biosimilars while ensuring the safety and efficacy of these important medicines
.”
Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH)
“
AUCH recognizes the need to improve the affordability of all components of healthcare, especially including the cost of pharmaceuticals. If enacted, the BRTEA could help reduce pharmaceutical prices through increased competition, particularly for costly biologics used to treat diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes and Rheumatoid Arthritis. AUCH is pleased that there is bipartisan interest in the BRTEA as this should help support its passage
.”
Vizient - Shoshana Krilow, Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Relations
“
Requiring additional switching studies for biosimilars to be interchangeable is unnecessarily burdensome and limits competition. We should be creating policies to increase access to these lower cost biosimilars and the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act is a significant step forward in doing just that,” said Shoshana Krilow, Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Relations for Vizient.
“We appreciate Sens. Lee and Lujan for their
leadership on this bipartisan bill and look forward to working together to advance the legislation.”
Dr. Jeffrey Hausfeld, Chairman of the Board and Chief Medical Officer – BioFactura, Inc.
“
The purpose of bringing biosimilars into the mainstream of US healthcare and the legislation supporting that evolution, should be focused on improving outcomes, quality of life, accessibility, and enhancing the patient experience, with medicines proven to be as potent, pure, safe, and effective as the branded drugs. The interchangeability status just creates a category which can be exploited to leverage continued mistrust in the technology, while adding no tangible value to the lives and well-being of patients entrusted to our care. Science is a universal language, and the same science is applied around the world, irrespective of a given sponsor’s business model, marketing strategy, or the ability to spend additional millions of dollars on interchangeability studies that have no proven benefit to healthcare outcomes. As a physician and Chairman of the Board of a biotech organization, I am in full support of this legislation
.”
Dr. Sean J. Callahan, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine
“
I support the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act introduced by Senator Lee. This legislation should improve market competition and reduce the cost of expensive medications for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions. It stands to help patients with pulmonary diseases, who often require these distinct therapies for treatment. As a provider who prescribes many of these costly medications I urge bipartisan support for this bill.
”
Beau Sorensen, COO – First Choice Home Health and Hospice
“
With healthcare costs continuing to increase, we are grateful for Senator Lee's leadership in helping patients get access to lower-cost biosimilar drugs by eliminating the red tape and unnecessary studies and steps that go into gaining FDA certification. Not only do we feel this will reduce costs for individuals, but it can also reduce overall costs for the Medicare program and taxpayers at large. This will be a huge help to our patients as they look to stay out of higher cost care settings through better access to affordable medications.
”
Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA)
“
PCMA applauds Sens. Mike Lee and Ben Ray Lujan’s bipartisan legislation which would accelerate biosimilar uptake in the United States by reducing complexity. Pharmacy benefit companies strongly support the removal of barriers that for too long have suppressed the biosimilars market. This measure will increase competition for biologic drugs, providing added choice and flexibility for health plan sponsors and employers and allow pharmacy benefit companies to leverage this enhanced competition to further reduce drug costs.
”
Prime Therapeutics Letter
“
Although biologics comprise approximately 3% of prescriptions in the U.S., these products account for over half of prescription medicine spending. Biosimilar drugs cost less and show no clinically meaningful difference from biologic drugs. Over the next five years, savings from biosimilars are expected to exceed $180 billion, representing a four-fold increase over the savings from the previous four years, according to a recent insurance study. The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act will make it easier to realize these projected savings. By deeming all biosimilars as interchangeable upon FDA approval, this important legislation would make it easier, depending on state law, for pharmacists to substitute biosimilars for brand products thus removing an important barrier to biosimilar uptake. This move would reduce complexity for pharmacies, prescribers, and patients, thereby reducing barriers to biosimilar dispensing
.”
HSA Coalition Letter
“
The Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act would streamline the biosimilar approval pathway and ensure that all approved biosimilars are deemed interchangeable, while respecting states' rights to regulate biosimilar substitution. By removing unnecessary obstacles, we can ensure wider market access and increase trust in these important medications, while reducing drug costs for consumers. We believe that this legislation aligns with biosimilar efficacy and safety and supports our shared goal improving the affordability of healthcare for all Americans
.”
Hiologics
“
Hiologics deeply appreciates Senator Mike Lee's pioneering Biosimilar Redtape Elimination Act, an essential step in improving patient access to affordable, effective biosimilar drugs. This legislation streamlines the FDA certification process and promotes market competition, enabling significant cost savings and overcoming key challenges that have  hampered the full potential of biosimilars

Title: No TSP Funding for Woke ESG
Date: June 23, 2023

Content:
Sen. Lee introduces bill to protect taxpayer dollars from woke ESG funds
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced the No ESG at TSP Act, crucial legislation to safeguard taxpayer dollars from ideologically driven investment funds. Representative Chip Roy (R-TX) introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. The bill addresses the growing concerns surrounding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, which pose risks to our domestic energy supply and promotes divisive ideological agendas.
The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) manages approximately $817 billion in total assets, making it the largest defined contribution plan globally. The majority of TSP contributions come from withholdings from federal employees or servicemembers paychecks and their respective agency matches. However, allowing billions of taxpayer dollars and agency matches to be used for ESG investments inadvertently endorses ESG policies.
The bill directs TSP to develop a process to identify and remove funds violating the act's provisions. Participants who have invested in prohibited funds at the time of the bill's enactment will have the opportunity to reinvest their assets. If a participant fails to reinvest, TSP will reallocate the assets to a core fund. The No ESG at TSP Act empowers participants or beneficiaries to bring a civil suit against TSP if it violates the act, ensuring accountability and the protection of taxpayer funds.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
"
This vital piece of legislation fights back against the destructive influence of ESG investing. This investing scheme, championed by woke corporations and facilitated by the Biden Administration, aims to undermine reliable American energy and advance radical ideologies, including the Administration’s political agenda. It is unacceptable for taxpayer funds to be channeled into these woke scams. Congress must take a stand and eliminate federal policies that promote this
detrimental agenda. Together, we can protect our energy sector, reject divisive ideologies, and ensure the financial well-being of hardworking Americans
."
Of the bill,
Rep. Chip Roy said,
"
ESG is an investing scheme woke corporations are using to appease the Left by destroying reliable American energy and advancing radical gender and racial ideologies.
“
Last year, the Thrift Savings Plan began allowing federal employees to invest their taxpayer-funded salaries into ESG plans. The U.S. Government has no business propping up woke scams like ESG. Congress should eradicate every federal policy and office that promotes it, starting here.

Title: Senators: BlackRock’s ESG Activism Harms Americans
Date: June 23, 2023

Content:
Sen. Lee Seeks Investigation into Climate Agenda Actions
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and 10 of his Senate colleagues sent a letter to Chairman Phillips and Commissioners urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "Commission") to investigate the actions of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, regarding its commitments to the Commission and its influence on utility operations.
The letter reads in part, "
BlackRock appears to have fundamentally departed from its promises. After joining CA100+ in 2000, BlackRock used its holdings to force its climate agenda on American utility companies. BlackRock's partnering with other activist asset managers through CA100+ and NZAM, appears to fundamentally conflict with its promise to keep its share percentage within certain limits.”
Senator Lee’s letter follows a motion filed at FERC by a coalition of 17 states, including Utah, urging federal energy regulators to review BlackRock Inc's ownership of utilities, citing concerns about the investment firm's role in initiatives to limit climate change.

Title: Putting Patients First: Lee Spearheads Islet Transplantation Bill
Date: June 22, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Budd (R-NC), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced a bill aimed at empowering patients and improving the outdated regulation of islet transplantation, a cutting-edge treatment for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes. Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. Focused on patient-centered care, this effort would move islets to a more appropriate regulatory framework.
Islets, vital micro-organs in the pancreas responsible for insulin production, are essential for individuals' well-being. However, those with Type 1 Diabetes face a daily struggle as their islets fail to function properly, necessitating insulin injections. Islet transplantation presents a transformative solution by utilizing islets from deceased donors to restore natural insulin production, potentially liberating patients from constant insulin administration.
Unfortunately, the current regulatory framework classifies islets as drugs, hindering progress and limiting access to this life-changing procedure. While other nations recognize islets as organs, establishing islet transplantation as the standard of care, the United States lags behind with outdated regulations.
Of the bill,
Sen Lee said,
“
This bill holds tremendous potential for those living with this chronic condition, offering the possibility of reducing or eliminating the need for injected insulin. By redefining islets as organs rather than drugs, we aim to align the regulatory framework with the scientific advancements in the field. This will promote innovation, enhance patient access to islet transplantation, and potentially improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes. It is time for Congress to act and address the regulatory mismatch that currently hinders progress in islet transplantation. By granting regulatory authority to the appropriate agencies and prohibiting the classification of islets as drugs, we can unlock the full potential of this life-changing procedure.
”
Of the bill,
Piotr Witkowski MD, Ph.D., Professor of Surgery, University of Chicago
,
said
,  “
The ISLET Act is extremely important for our patients with type 1 diabetes and is long overdue. It will allow us to treat the most vulnerable patients with a life-threatening form of diabetes and develop novel therapies to cure the disease. If passed, Americans, like diabetic patients in other countries, will finally have open access to islet transplantation procedures and the chance to experience a new life, one without insulin, constant blood sugar swings, and fear of sudden death. The ISLET Act is the result of several years of joint efforts of leaders and experts in the field of transplantation and diabetes from top academic instruction in the US calling for years for this regulatory update
.”
Of the bill,
Camillo Ricordi, Founding President and Treasurer of The Cure Alliance said
, “
On behalf of the entire board of The Cure Alliance, it is with the highest degree of enthusiasm that we support, without any reservation, this initiative that may allow for US patients with diabetes to benefit from islet transplantation, like it is already happening in most of the rest of the world.
”
Of the bill,
Peter Stock, MD, PhD, Professor of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco said
, “
I strongly support the Increase Support for Life-saving Endocrine Transplantation (ISLET) Act. If enacted, this bill will put the US on par with the rest of the world, and facilitate research and clinical application of islet transplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus
.”
Of the bill,
Whitney Rimmer, an ISLET transplant recipient, said,
"
The Increase Support for Life-saving Endocrine Transplantation (ISLET) Act would be an answered prayer for so many with diabetes. I know, because I was a brittle type 1 diabetic for 32 years and recently received an islet cell transplant that has allowed me to be insulin independent. This has allowed me to really live again, not just survive, and to be present for my children, family and friends.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces 21st Century Worker Act
Date: June 22, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the 21st Century Worker Act, a comprehensive bill to address confusion with current labor policy and promote flexible work arrangements. The proposed legislation establishes a bright line test to determine a worker's status, providing clarity and enabling businesses and workers to embrace flexibility.
Existing labor policy in the United States is often convoluted, as different tests and laws evaluate whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor. Due to the potential liability risk, this inconsistency hinders businesses from hiring independent contractors. The Biden administration's approach also undermines alternative work arrangements, assuming they are exploitative or unfair, even though many workers prefer such arrangements. In fact, nearly one in three American workers participate in contract work, which generates around 5% of the country's GDP.
The 21st Century Worker Act establishes a clear and consistent bright line test for federal labor and tax law. By outlining the most common factors for classifying workers as independent contractors or employees, this test eliminates ambiguity and empowers businesses and workers to pursue flexible arrangements confidently.
The bill also includes a provision for workers and businesses to mutually elect worker status when they do not fit cleanly into the conventional classifications. Recognizing that the government can't anticipate every work arrangement, this provision ensures fairness and flexibility.
To assess the impact of harmonizing other laws with this bright line test, the 21st Century Worker Act calls for a comprehensive study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This study will analyze how aligning additional legislation with the proposed test will affect workers and payors, providing valuable insights for future policy decisions.
Of the bill,
Sen. Mike Braun said,
"
One in three Americans are gig workers and as an entrepreneur myself, I have long been a strong supporter of independent contractors and the gig economy here in the Senate. I'm glad to join Sen. Lee in updating outdated labor policy to reflect changing work arrangements through the 21st Century Worker Act.
"
Of the bill,
Ryan Walker, Vice President of Government Relations, Heritage Action, said
, "The Department of Labor's recently proposed rule to redefine how independent contractors are defined continues the Biden administration's war on American workers, which limits employment opportunities and flexibility through costly regulations and heavy-handed enforcement. Fortunately, Senator Lee's 21st Century Workers Act would block Biden's damaging policy and permanently replace it with a clear definition that allows workers to find employment arrangements that work best for them. All Senators should support this effort and push back against the Left's attempts to force all workers into its preferred one-size-fits-all employment structure."
Of the bill, Alfredo Ortiz,
Job Creators Network President & CEO, said
, "
Senator Lee's 21st Century Worker Act would ensure that millions of Americans who choose to be an independent contractor can continue to enjoy the flexibility that designation provides. After decades of confusion, Senator Lee's bill would provide small business owners with much-needed clarity regarding who is and is not an independent contractor.
"
Of the bill,
the Direct Selling Association & Utah Direct Selling Coalition, said
, "
We applaud Senator Lee for introducing this legislation that will help create clarity for direct sellers in Utah and across the United States. The independent contractor status of salesforce members has been recognized for decades and this legislation will create harmonization across statutes for specific recognition that direct selling is a truly independent business. This bill is even more important in the current uncertain regulatory landscape and we are proud to support it.

Title: Leveling the Playing Field: Senators Swing for Fair Competition in Baseball
Date: June 15, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a groundbreaking bill to repeal a century-old judicially-created exemption that grants Major League Baseball (MLB) a unique advantage over other professional sports leagues when it comes to antitrust laws. The proposed legislation aims to promote fair competition within baseball and ensure a level playing field for all teams and leagues, particularly in light of recent controversies surrounding the Dodgers Pride Night and the relocation of the All-Star Game from Atlanta.
The current antitrust exemption, established by the Supreme Court in the 1922
Federal Baseball Club
v.
National League
case, has granted MLB an exceptional legal status that is not enjoyed by any other major professional sports league in the United States. This exemption has shielded baseball from the scrutiny of antitrust laws, impeding competition, and limiting the potential for innovation and growth within the industry.
In a joint statement,
Sens. Lee, Rubio, Cruz, and Hawley said,
"
The time has come to strike out the outdated and unequal treatment that has long benefited the MLB. Just as teams fiercely compete on the diamond, every sports league should operate under the same antitrust regulations. Our bill will level the playing field, removing the century-old exemption that has given the MLB an unfair advantage. It's time to bring baseball in line with other leagues, fostering a competitive environment that sparks innovation, drives excellence, and keeps fans on the edge of their seats.
"
The senators' proposed bill will aim to remove the antitrust exemption that has long shielded MLB from legal challenges related to anticompetitive behavior, thereby allowing for greater scrutiny and accountability. This legislative action seeks to promote fair competition, provide opportunities for other leagues to thrive, and ultimately benefit players, teams, and fans alike.

Title: Lee Harnesses Unused Budget Authority to Aid Great Salt Lake
Date: June 13, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) introduced the Great Salt Lake Water Stewardship Act, critical legislation that addresses the dire ecological crisis facing the Great Salt Lake.
The Great Salt Lake serves as the cornerstone of the region's ecology and economy, but it currently faces severe drought conditions that threaten its long-term existence. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Great Salt Lake Stewardship Act proposes the expansion of the existing water conservation program under the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) to include the entire Great Salt Lake drainage basin and allows unexpended budget authority available under CUPCA to be used for much-needed water conservation efforts.
The proposed bill would grant the Secretary of the Interior the flexibility to allocate unexpended budget authority from other sections of CUPCA towards the existing water conservation program. By expanding the geographic coverage of the program to include the entire Great Salt Lake drainage basin, the bill aims to support the efforts of the State of Utah, local communities, and water districts north of Salt Lake County in conserving water use and replenishing the lake.
“
The Great Salt Lake is immensely valuable to Utahns and the surrounding region. As we face ongoing drought conditions, it is crucial that we take a responsible approach to address the challenges posed to the lake,
”
said Sen. Lee.
“
This bill presents a thoughtful solution by leveraging existing resources and promoting efficient water conservation practices. By utilizing unexpended budget authority, we can maximize the impact of our conservation efforts without placing an additional burden on taxpayers.
”
Of the bill,
Gene Shawcroft, General Manager of the Central Utah Water Conservancy District said
, “
This legislation will provide access to program funding already provided through the Central Utah Project Completion Act program and repurpose unspent funding to elevate Utah’s water conservation efforts. This is one way to replenish and sustain the Great Salt Lake drainage basin during shifting climates. I am grateful for Senator Mike Lee and Congressman John Curtis for their leadership on the bill and the Utah delegation offices for their support.
”
Of the bill,
Alan Packard, General Manager of the Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District said
, “
As Utah’s hydrology continues to evolve, water conservation has become an essential way of life for our customers. This legislative approach offers long-term and attainable solutions for addressing the ongoing challenges facing the Great Salt Lake. This legislation is vital for Utah’s water future.
”
Of the bill,
Scott Paxman, General Manager of the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District said
, “
We have been actively engaged with the state legislators, State Departments of Utah and other water users in finding solutions that provide long-term benefits for the Great Salt Lake, while balancing the needs for agriculture and the growing population. This legislation led by Senator Mike Lee and Congressman John Curtis gives Utah another tool to identify and complete water conservation projects that will benefit the basin.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces ARTICLE ONE Act to Reclaim Congressional Power
Date: June 9, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the ARTICLE ONE Act, a bill that would reclaim significant legislative powers delegated to the executive branch by the National Emergencies Act of 1976.
When Congress passed this act in 1976, it gave the president of the United States the ability to exercise unilateral power like a king. Now, there are more than forty ongoing national emergencies that were never approved by Congress and have no expiration date.
“
This kind of lawmaking-by-proclamation runs directly counter to the vision of our Founders and undermines the safeguards protecting our freedom
,”
s
aid
Sen. Lee.
“
It’s high time that Congress reclaimed its legislative power and restored constitutional balance to our Republic
.”
Of the bill,
Rep. Roy said,
“
The presidency was never meant to have monarchical power over the American people; that’s why the framers of our constitution designed a system of checks and balances.
“
For far too long, however, presidents from both sides of the aisle have ignored Congress and undermined the constitutional order by abusing the virtually unchecked power to declare national emergencies.
“The Article One Act reasserts Congress’ authority over emergency declarations and rebalances federal power between the legislative and executive branches as the framers of the Constitution intended for it. I am proud to join my friend Senator Mike Lee in reintroducing this bill and am glad to have Representative Steve Cohen join me in this bipartisan initiative.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Blumenthal said,
“
Requiring the reauthorization of emergency declarations after 30 days will reassert Congress’ role in governing our nation during times of crisis. If we continue to sit on the sidelines, our institution will ignore its constitutional responsibility, undermining our fundamental separation of powers.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Braun said,
“
The Biden administration has gotten into the bad habit of forcing their unpopular measures through Executive Order that otherwise would not make it through the congressional legislative process. I’m proudly cosponsoring this bill that reclaims and solidifies the Legislative Branch as the lawmaking authority in America.”
Of the bill,
Rep. Cohen said, “
When I was Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, I held hearings on the National Emergencies Act and built bipartisan support for its reform. Our government is defined by checks and balances. But right now, Presidents can tap into emergency powers without any meaningful political check, time limit, or public rationale.  We need to restore the balance of power and make sure that emergency powers are used only in emergencies and that Congress is integral to the process.  I’m pleased to join with my colleague in the House, Congressman Chip Roy and Senators Mike Lee and Richard Blumenthal in this continuing bipartisan effort. An emergency declared during the Carter Administration should not still be in effect.”
The ARTICLE ONE Act would automatically end all future emergency declarations made pursuant to the NEA after 30 days unless Congress affirmatively votes to extend the emergency. Currently, Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto.
The bill’s full name is the “Assuring that Robust, Thorough, and Informed Congressional Leadership is Exercised Over National Emergencies Act.”

Title: Senator Lee to seek vote on Amendment to the "Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023"
Date: June 1, 2023

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) has introduced an
amendment
to the "
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023
" in a move to promote fiscal accountability and regulatory reform. The amendment seeks to strike
Section 265
from the Act, a provision that undermines fiscal restraint in proposed regulatory rule-making.
Section 265 currently empowers the Biden Administration's Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Shalanda Young, to unilaterally waive a provision referred to as "administrative PAYGO". This provision requires administrative agencies to offset the expense of any regulatory discretionary administrative action. Removing ths check undermines the Fiscal Responsibility Act's claim to regulatory reforms.
In a recent White House briefing, Director Young
stated
:
"... if that waiver is deemed necessary to make sure President Biden's agenda is carried forward, we're going to use that authority."
This declaration underscores the need for Lee’s proposed amendment to maintain control over government spending.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces FORMULA 3.0
Date: June 1, 2023

Content:
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ)—along with Reps. Adrian Smith (R-NE) and Don Beyer (D-VA) introduced the FORMULA 3.0 Act. Building upon the success of his previous bills. Sen. Lee's latest legislation aims to permanently waive tariffs and ease trade barriers on infant formula, ensuring a stable and accessible supply for families across the United States.
Senator Lee has been a driving force in combating the formula shortage. In July 2022, his FORMULA Act was signed into law by President Biden, temporarily suspending tariffs on imported formulas. The relief provided by this legislation played a crucial role in enabling formula companies to bring more supplies to the United States, easing the burden on families in need.
Now, with the introduction of the FORMULA 3.0 Act, Senator Lee aims to solidify and expand upon the progress made. This bill will permanently waive tariffs on infant formula base powder, ensuring a continuous and reliable supply for families. By doing so, domestic manufacturers will be able to increase their production, further easing the formula crisis in the United States.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The welfare of our families, especially our infants, is of utmost importance. The formula shortage has highlighted the need for long-term solutions that promote accessibility and affordability. With the FORMULA 3.0 Act, we take a significant step towards permanently eliminating trade barriers and ensuring a stable supply of infant formula for families across the nation.
”
“
I’m proud to be co-leading this bipartisan effort to permanently waive tariffs on infant formula, which will lower prices and ensure we can protect infants from risks associated with current or future supply shortages. We have a responsibility to care for our families and children, and this common-sense solution will do just that,
”
said Sen. Menendez.
“
The baby formula crisis put an additional spotlight on the serious supply chain challenges we face
,”
said Rep. Smith, Chairman of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee.
“
Congress immediately came together in a bipartisan way to waive tariffs on safe, FDA-approved formula, and it alleviated some of the pressures families faced when searching for formula. Now that those tariffs have returned, the availability of formula has become strained once again. That’s why we are working in a bipartisan, bicameral way to permanently lift barriers to safely import formula and give families more options and access to the formula they need.
”
“
The fragility of the domestic infant formula market was put into stark relief last year when a problem at just one company’s facility led to a drastic supply shortage and massive price increases for parents nationwide
,”
said Rep. Beyer.
“
Due to high tariffs and other protectionist obstacles preventing high-quality infant formula imports from the global market, parents with small children were left scrambling to find affordable alternatives. With the expiration of temporary emergency measures designed to ease the shortage, the market remains extremely vulnerable to another supply shock. This bill would permanently eliminate trade barriers to encourage the import of FDA-compliant infant formula, bringing prices down for parents in the near term and staving off a potential future crisis
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Katie Britt said,
“
As a mom of two, I know firsthand how critical it is to be able to find formula for your baby,” said Senator Katie Britt. “During the formula shortage last year, too many families were forced to confront the unthinkable, often desperately searching and coming up empty-handed. Permanently waiving these tariffs on allied countries gives parents greater access to formula. I’m proud to join my colleagues in bringing forward this bipartisan legislation that will ensure American families are able to provide their children with critical, life-sustaining nutrition.
”
“
The FORMULA 3.0 Act seeks to provide a much-needed permanent response to the ongoing infant formula shortage that would ensure additional market flexibility in both good times and bad while tearing down artificial barriers that have long made it difficult for parents to obtain their formula of choice. During the severe domestic supply shortages of 2022, tariffs and other restrictions on imported infant formula had a detrimental effect on the market’s ability to respond. Congress rightfully recognized the ability of freer trade to help remedy the situation, albeit only temporarily. To build off that success in a permanent context, the R Street Institute is pleased to support the FORMULA 3.0 Act,
”
said Jerry Theodorou, Policy Director for Finance, Insurance and Trade

Title: University of Utah Research Park Act Passes Committee
Date: May 18, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Mitt Romney's (R-UT) University of Utah Research Park Act passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on a unanimous vote. This bill would preserve the University of Utah’s nearly 600-acre research park and avoid possible action by the Bureau of Land Management to repurpose the land. Research Park is a center for research and development serving both the University and the local workforce. Research Park is situated on a parcel of land which was transferred to the University by the Bureau of Land Management in 1968. Lee and Romney partnered on this legislation to ensure Research Park remains productive and thriving. The bill is now eligible for consideration by the full Senate.
In a joint statement,
Sens. Lee and Romney said
, “
This is a significant milestone for the bill, which will help preserve the University of Utah’s Research Park and ensure it continues to thrive. We are grateful for the Committee’s support and look forward to our continued work together moving this legislation forward. This bill will positively impact Utah’s economy and will help maintain Utah’s status as a hub for innovation and research.
”
After sponsoring companion legislation in the House,
Rep. Chris Stewart said
, “
The important work being done at the University of Utah provides our state with invaluable innovations. I’m proud to stand beside Senator Lee in support of this legislation. And I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in protecting research that will continue to benefit communities across the country
.”
University of Utah President Taylor Randall said
, “
Since its establishment in 1968, Research Park has become a key component in the university’s mission to foster innovation, advance science and contribute to Utah’s strong economy. The forethought of state and federal leaders in making this investment of land to the university has reaped extraordinary success and resulted in a myriad of scientific discoveries and companies that have improved the health and well-being of all Americans. This public-private partnership remains a case study in how major research universities can contribute to the success of their communities. I support this legislation and the resulting positive impact it will have on the university and our state

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Senators Defending Supreme Court

WASHINGTON
– Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ted Budd (R-NC), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Cornyn (R-TX), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Ron Johnson (R-WI) sent a
letter
to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR), expressing concerns over "unprecedented attacks" on the Supreme Court, including Sen. Wyden’s April 24, 2023
letter to Harlan Crow
requesting tax return information from a private citizen as an attempt to further smear Justice Clarence Thomas and to bully the Supreme Court into acting as “a super legislature to implement progressive policies.”
The Senators state:
"We reject this manufactured 'ethics crisis' at the Supreme Court as a ploy to further Democrats’ efforts to undermine public confidence and change the makeup of the court."
They criticize attempts to withhold $10 million in security funding for the Court:
"It is shocking that the Democrats would try to leverage the physical security of Supreme Court justices and their families to force the Court to bend to its demands."
The letter also defends Justice Clarence Thomas:
"Justice Thomas is an honorable man, a principled jurist, and one of our nation’s greatest justices...But because he refuses to compromise his principles, the left has increasingly sought to discredit him."
The Senators call for an end to the attacks on the justices and their families:
"These attacks on the Supreme Court and the justices must end. They are undermining the rule of law, endangering the security of the justices and their families, and inflicting incalculable damage on our country."

Title: Sen. Lee Leads 43 GOP Senators in Opposition to Raising Debt Limit Without Substantive Spending and Budget Reforms
Date: May 6, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) leads a group of 43 Republican Senators in sending the letter below to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The letter expresses a collective commitment to oppose raising the debt ceiling without substantive spending and budget reforms.
Of the letter,
Sen. Lee said
,
“It is now clear that Senate Republicans aren’t going to bail out Biden and Schumer, they have to negotiate. I thank my colleagues for joining my effort to emphasize this point in the clearest possible terms.”
Dear Leader Schumer,
The Senate Republican conference is united behind the House Republican conference in support of spending cuts and structural budget reform as a starting point for negotiations on the debt ceiling.
Our economy is in free fall due to unsustainable fiscal policies. This trajectory must be addressed with fiscal reforms. Moreover, recent Treasury projections have reinforced the urgency of addressing the debt ceiling. The House has taken a responsible first step in coming to the table with their proposals. It is imperative that the president now do the same.
As such, we will not be voting for cloture on any bill that raises the debt ceiling without substantive spending and budget reforms.
The letter is signed by Senators Mike Lee, John Barrasso, Marsha Blackburn, John Boozman, Mike Braun, Ted Budd, Shelley Moore Capito, Bill Cassidy, Katie Britt, John Cornyn, Tom Cotton, Mike Crapo, Ted Cruz, Kevin Cramer, Steve Daines, Joni Ernst, Deb Fischer, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley, Bill Hagerty, John Hoeven, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Roger Marshall, Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, Markwayne Mullin, Pete Ricketts, James Risch, Marco Rubio, Mike Rounds, Tim Scott, Rick Scott, Eric Schmitt, Dan Sullivan, John Thune, Thom Tillis, Tommy Tuberville, J.D.

Title: Group of Senators and House Members Express Concern Over U.S. Aid to Ukraine
Date: April 20, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– A group of Senators and House members, led by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ), sent
a letter
to President Biden expressing concern about the United States' response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The lawmakers emphasized the need for a clear diplomatic strategy to bring the war to a rapid conclusion. Additional signatories of the letter include Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Reps. Eli Crane (R-AZ), Mary Miller (R-IL), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Dan Bishop (R-NC), Barry Moore (R-AL), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Matt Rosendale (R-MT), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Josh Brecheen (R-TX), Andy Ogles (R-TN) and Mike Collins (R-GA).
The letter says in part
,
“Unrestrained U.S. aid for Ukraine must come to an end, and we will adamantly oppose all future aid packages unless they are linked to a clear diplomatic strategy designed to bring this war to a rapid conclusion.”
The letter also highlights the risks associated with continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and military aid, noting that such actions could escalate the conflict and create a dangerous proxy war with Russia. The lawmakers underscore the need for the United States to focus on its own military readiness and economic security, rather than allocating substantial resources to a foreign conflict.
The group of lawmakers calls on the President to prioritize diplomatic efforts and advocate for  a negotiated peace between Ukraine and Russia. They argue that the United States' interests and those of the Ukrainian people are best served by incentivizing negotiations and bringing the conflict to a resolution.
The full text of the letter can be found
here
.
Dan Caldwell, Vice President of Center for Renewing America  said
,
"The Biden Administration's largely open-ended support of Ukraine has heightened the risk of a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia and distracted from more urgent national security priorities. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is immoral but is effectively a European security challenge. The burden for supporting Ukraine must be borne primarily by wealthy European welfare states who have more at stake in the conflict and who have for decades been free-riding off an American security umbrella. We at the Center for Renewing America applaud these members of Congress for challenging the Biden Administration's reckless Ukraine policy and for demanding that American foreign policy put American interests first."
Russ Duerstine, Executive Director of Concerned Veterans for America said,
“Russia’s war against Ukraine drags on with no end in sight, continuing to risk wider regional escalation or a nuclear exchange the longer it lasts. While Ukraine has fought valiantly, peace remains elusive, prolonging the catastrophic devastation its people face. America’s open-ended support of Kyiv’s war effort has not been tied to a realistic strategy for bringing the fighting to an end acceptable for Ukrainian and American interests. As this letter makes clear, our current approach is unsustainable—America sends more aid than all European countries and institutions combined, despite the conflict being in their backyard. Meanwhile, Moscow drifts closer to Beijing the longer the conflict lasts, and America’s own stockpiles further deplete faster than we can replace them. CVA applauds Senator Lee’s and Representative Crane’s call to protect U.S. interests by laying the foundation for a responsible resolution to this tragic conflict."

Title: Lee Introduces SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act
Date: April 19, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the
SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act
(SRUMA), a bold piece of legislation aimed at strengthening work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and closing loopholes that have contributed to its rapid expansion. The number of SNAP beneficiaries has grown from 17.1 million in 2000 to 41.1 million in 2022, while the cost of providing benefits has risen from $17 billion to $119 billion. Meanwhile, SNAP continues to experience fraud and abuse that undermines the program’s integrity.
SNAP was designed to provide temporary relief to vulnerable individuals facing difficult times. Work requirements, which are widely supported by the American public, serve as a commonsense measure to preserve the program for future beneficiaries. Strengthening these requirements will encourage SNAP recipients to seek employment, which is associated with improved mental health and a reduction in poverty cycles.
Senator Lee said
, “
The SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act represents a significant stride in fortifying work requirements and enhancing the overall integrity of the SNAP program. By tackling issues of fraud, abuse, and existing loopholes, this legislation aims to maintain the availability of SNAP for those in need and foster an environment that promotes self-sufficiency and opportunities for upward mobility. Through these reforms, we seek to empower individuals to transition from temporary assistance to long-term independence and financial stability.”
Key provisions of SRUMA include:
Establishing a temporary bipartisan commission within the Census Bureau to improve income and poverty measurement, allocating $1 million for its operation.
Expanding general work requirements to individuals ages 16-64, and hour-based work requirements to individuals ages 18-64 with dependents over six years old.
Closing the geographic waiver loophole and reducing the percentage of the SNAP caseload that states can exempt from work requirements from 15% to 5%.
Allowing married individuals with dependents to fulfill hour-based work requirements jointly and mandating USDA reports on SNAP Employment and Training Program outcomes.
Requiring a 5% state match in SNAP benefits, increasing by 5% each year until a 50% match is reached, incentivizing states to conduct greater oversight.
Closing the "broad-based categorical eligibility" loophole in SNAP and requiring recipients to cooperate with fraud investigations.
Instituting penalties for unauthorized uses of Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards and enhancing fraud prevention measures for food retailers.
Reinstating the publication of annual SNAP State Activity Reports and allowing states to retain 50% of funds collected from intentional program violations for fraud prevention efforts.
Akash Chougule, Vice President, Americans for Prosperity said,
“We applaud Senator Lee for his efforts to ensure that our welfare programs are truly designed to lift people up toward a better life. All Americans deserve the dignity of earned success, and empowering Americans to climb the ladder of opportunity through work helps do so. We look forward to working with Sen. Lee and others to reform our welfare system that continues to trap too many of our fellow Americans in a cycle of dependency that they do not want to be in and is not meeting their needs.”
Tarren Bragdon, president and CEO of the Foundation for Government Accountability said,
“
Simply put, work requirements work. At a time when we have two open jobs for every person looking for one, the federal government must do what it can to address the labor crisis. By strengthening work requirements for our federal food stamp program, Sen. Lee's SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act will protect valuable resources for the truly needy while helping states get Americans off the sidelines to experience the dignity of work."
Ryan Walker, Vice President of Government Relations, Heritage
Action said,
“
Like all government programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) should incentivize work, not discourage it, as working is the most effective way for individuals to start down a pathway to success and fulfillment. Getting more individuals into the workforce will reduce poverty, long-term government dependence, and social isolation. Senator Lee’s SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act makes important changes to the SNAP program that will encourage recipients to find work, which will provide them with the skills necessary for long-term success and independence.

Title: The AMERICA Act: Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Digital Advertising Competition
Date: March 30, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), JD Vance (R-OH), and John Kennedy (R-LA), introduced the
Advertising Middlemen Endangering Rigorous Internet Competition Accountability (AMERICA) Act
. The bill would restore and protect competition in digital advertising by eliminating conflicts of interest that have allowed the leading platforms in the market to manipulate ad auctions and impose monopoly rents on a broad swath of the American economy.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the internet economy. It supports most of the free content and services Americans have come to rely upon, including essential local journalism, and it allows businesses of every size to reach their customers quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, online advertising is also suffering under the thumb of trillion-dollar tech companies.
“
Companies like Google and Facebook have been able to exploit their unprecedented troves of detailed user data to obtain vice grip-like control over digital advertising, amassing power on every side of the market and using it to block competition and take advantage of their customers. The conflicts of interest are so glaring that one Google employee described Google’s ad business as being like ‘if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.
’
“
This lack of competition in digital advertising means that monopoly rents are being imposed upon every website that is ad-supported and every company—small, medium, or large—that relies on internet advertising to grow its business. It is essentially a tax on thousands of American businesses, and thus a tax on millions of American consumers.
“
While online advertising is essential to nearly every business, this broken system has been the primary driver of growth for the tech companies that have failed us in so many other ways: by undermining our privacy, censoring our speech, and exploiting our children.
“
That is why I have introduced this bill, and why I believe it is the first step towards liberating the internet—and therefore much of the 21st century economy—from the grip of Big Tech monopolists.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Klobuchar said,
“
For too long, Google and Facebook have dominated the digital advertising marketplace at the expense of advertisers, publishers, and consumers. It is past time for a transparent ad technology industry where the best interests of customers are prioritized and companies of all sizes are able to compete. This legislation will put rules in place to do just that, restoring and protecting competition in digital advertising to create a more even playing field that will promote fairness and innovation moving forward
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Blumenthal said,
“
Google, Facebook, and other online advertising giants take advantage of their market power to control rival publishers, advertisers, and brokers. Extracting exorbitant fees and favoring their own services, these monopolists hurt consumers, competition, and local journalism. Our legislation takes important steps to prevent marketplace abuse and allow those harmed to seek legal recourse. It’s time to ensure an even playing field in our digital advertising landscape
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Rubio said,
“
Small businesses rely on digital advertising, but industry consolidation and conflicts of interest are tilting the scales against them. It is time to restore competition, transparency, and fairness into the digital ad space
.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Kennedy said,
“
Big Tech does not have the right to stack the deck in its favor at the expense of competition. I’m supporting the AMERICA Act to hold Big Tech accountable for anti-competitive behavior and limit its power to manipulate ads that get pushed to unsuspecting consumers.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Graham said
, “
Our bill restores competition and fairness in the digital advertising industry, passing on the benefits to consumers. A small group of dominant digital platforms are playing both sides and steamrolling any competition in advertising online. By ending the monopoly held by these larger platforms, we will promote free competition and ultimately I believe, save money for small businesses and consumers alike.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Vance said
, “
It is high time for Congress to free our digital economy from the stranglehold of Big Tech. A system that allows large companies to control all sides of the digital advertising market has no place in the American economy. I’m proud to join this effort to restore competition and rein in the Big Tech companies
.”
Of the bill,
Rep. Ken Buck said,
"
Digital advertising is a key component in the digital economy. Today, Google and Facebook continue to exploit an unprecedented monopoly over digital advertising that chokes off competition and controls every side of the marketplace. This vital piece of legislation will restore competition in the digital ad tech marketplace and put an end to the system Big Tech monopolies have exploited for years.
"
Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next said,
“
The digital advertising marketplace operates like a financial marketplace with brokers representing buyers and sellers. But, unlike financial markets, there are no requirements for transparency and there are no rules to avoid conflicts of interest and insider trading
.
We support the AMERICA Act because it will reinforce the basic free market tenets of competition and transparency in digital advertising, which fuels the online content we all read and love and are a necessity for all sorts of businesses – small and large – to efficiently reach consumers
.”
Mike Davis, Founder and President of the Internet Accountability Project, said
, “
The AMERICA Act will break up Google’s online advertising monopoly. This bill from Senator Mike Lee is a silver bullet in the battle to dismantle Big Tech. Senate and House leadership must consider this legislation if they’re serious about combating the threat Big Tech poses to our online freedoms, economic innovation, and small business prosperity. Republicans like Mike Lee are leading on this issue–his colleagues in Congress who claim to be conservative warriors against Big Tech must join him.
”
Sen. Lee introduced similar legislation—
The Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act
—in the 117th Congress with support from the following:
Heritage Action for America
American Principles Project
Citizens for Renewing America
Internet Accountability Project
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton
Bull Moose Project
Clare Morrell, Ethics & Public Policy Center Big Tech Project
Digital Progress Institute
Public Knowledge
American Economic Liberties Project
Jon Schweppe, Policy Director at the American Principles Project, said,
“
Republicans are increasingly recognizing the threat posed by Big Tech's concentrated corporate power. Senator Mike Lee in particular has been an important leader on the issue of antitrust enforcement. His Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act is well thought-out and addresses rampant anti-competitive behavior in the online ads market. American Principles Project is proud to endorse this bill, and we encourage Republicans to continue to embrace an all-of-the-above approach to reining in Big Tech.
”
Matt Stoller, Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project, said,
“
The basic idea of this bill is simple: no one can serve two masters,
”  “
As the buyer, seller, broker, and exchange, Google maintains pervasive conflicts of interest in online advertising that it uses to manipulate markets. By breaking up Google’s third party ad tech business and requiring advertising intermediaries to disclose the prices and quality of the advertising they are buying and selling, this bill will finally allow honest price discovery in markets for online advertising.
”
“
No one would accept Goldman Sachs running the New York Stock Exchange, representing buyers of stock, and sellers of stock at the same time, just as no one would accept a lawyer representing both sides in a trial. Neither should Congress let corporations run all sides of a transaction in online ad markets.
”
Wade Miller, Executive Director at Citizens for Renewing America, said,
“
The days of Big Tech getting away with gaming the digital advertising system are over. Senator Mike Lee's ‘Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act’ will end the market manipulation and anticompetitive practices of some of the biggest companies in tech. Sen. Lee has shown Congress how to break-up big tech the right way. We commend his efforts and urge Congress to stop talking and start legislating.
”
Charlotte Slaiman, Competition Policy Director at Public Knowledge, said
, “
The lack of competition in online advertising technology hurts not just advertisers and publishers but also consumers who pay more for products and see lower quality news and other content online. Right now, advertising is the primary business model for much of the internet. It’s essential that online advertising be an open ecosystem with dynamic and fair competition. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act takes a remarkable step towards that ideal by breaking up the largest ad tech giants and creating common-sense rules of the road. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act from Senators Lee and Klobuchar can address gatekeeper power in ad tech and make this market function better for consumers.
”
Mike Davis of the Internet Accountability Project said,
“
For many years now, monopolist control from Facebook and Google over the ad tech market has hurt small businesses, slowed innovation and stifled competition. Passing this bill into law would help put an end to the anticompetitive practices these Big Tech monopolists rely on for their undue trillions in market control. The Internet Accountability Project thanks Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz for their leadership and dedication to the free market and antitrust principles that are critical to restoring a fair and well functioning tech economy that encourages innovation and success.
”
Joel Thayer, President of the Digital Progress Institute, said,
“
Large tech platforms have operated under complete opacity, which has allowed them to engage in anticompetitive behavior within the digital ad market. Senator Lee’s Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act takes this issue head on by applying a meaningful and targeted framework that will not only help shed light on these practices that detrimentally harm competition in the digital ad space, but will also help open doors for smaller players by evening the odds. The Digital Progress Institute is proud to endorse this important piece of legislation.
”
Aiden Buzzetti, President of the Bull Moose Project, said,
“
The Bull Moose Project enthusiastically supports the CDTA. This is a huge step in leveling the playing field of digital advertising. For too long we have seen companies dominate this field. Senator Lee should be commended for this legislation. We hope all Republicans will support this bill.
”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said
, “
We strongly support this legislation as a complement to our litigation efforts.  Both approaches are necessary to address Google's abuses and restore competition to the ad tech market.

Title: Sen. Lee Joins Effort to Overturn Biden’s Reckless Student Loan Scheme Through Congressional Review Act
Date: March 28, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON –
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Sens. Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Joni Ernst (R-IA) in announcing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn President Biden’s student loan cancelation scheme, which would transfer up to $20,000 in student loan debt per borrower onto taxpayers, costing an
estimated $400 billion
. This comes after the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
confirmed
that the student loan policy is classified as a rule and can be overturned under the CRA.
Recently, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the cases
Biden v. Nebraska
and
Department of Education v. Brown
on whether the student cancelation program is unconstitutional and violates President Biden’s executive authority. The Supreme Court is expected to issue an opinion on the policy this summer.
“
President Biden's thinly veiled attempt to buy political support before the midterm election is government favoritism at its worst
,”
said Sen. Lee
. “
His plan doesn't 'cancel' student debt; it sends a tuition bill to those who chose a different path. I'm proud to support this resolution, which will block the President from picking winners and losers and buying votes at the expense of the American taxpayer.
”
“
President Biden’s student loan scheme does not ‘forgive’ debt, it just transfers the burden from those who willingly took out loans to those who never went to college, or sacrificed to pay their loans off
,”
said Dr. Cassidy
. “
Where is the relief for the man who skipped college but is paying off his work truck, or the woman who paid off her loans and is now struggling to afford her mortgage? This resolution prevents these Americans, whose debts look different from the favored group the Biden administration has selected, from picking up the bill for this irresponsible and unfair policy
.”
“
The Biden administration’s tuition bailout is bad public policy, and it's unfair to people who've paid their college debt off by working multiple jobs or consciously meeting their obligations,
”
said Senator Cornyn
. “
This would block President Biden’s political gambit from driving up inflation, incentivizing universities to raise tuition, and forcing hardworking Texans to pay off the debts of wealthy graduates.
”
“
President Biden’s unfair attempt to transfer nearly half a trillion dollars in student debt to American taxpayers only helps the wealthy and hurts working families. Why should Iowans who chose to go straight into the workforce or pay for their own education foot the bill? Despite the administration’s attempts at avoiding Congressional oversight, we’re working to protect hardworking Americans and put a stop to the president’s reckless actions
,”
said Senator Ernst.
Last month, Sen. Lee
joined
Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and 41 other senators in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court challenging the Biden administration’s student loan cancelation program, which they say circumvents the authority of Congress.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bills to Improve U.S. Aviation Industry
Date: March 24, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced three bills to improve and encourage innovation in the U.S. aviation industry: the Aviation Empowerment Act, the Flight Sharing Freedom Act, the Screening Partnership Reform Act, and the Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act. Details about the bills can be found below.
Aviation Empowerment Act
The Aviation Empowerment Act would address outdated FAA rules and regulations that stifle innovation within the general aviation sector by preventing participation in the “sharing economy.”
Currently, “private pilots” may carry a small number of passengers only by coordinating on physical bulletin boards to share flight costs. They are prohibited from coordinating on online platforms, and deemed “common carriers,” like a major airline, if they do so. Since the FAA has not defined “common carrier” in federal law, the FAA has broad authority to determine who and what meets its regulatory interpretation. Furthermore, current federal law prohibits private pilots from receiving compensation for the transport of persons or property.
The Aviation Empowerment Act would help bring 21st century innovation to aviation by correcting these oversights to allow a “flight sharing” economy. In particular, the bill would:
Codify a definition of a “common carrier” based on the FAA’s own internal regulatory definition
Reverse the FAA’s ban on online flight-sharing by allowing private pilots to communicate with the public through the internet, or in any manner they deem appropriate
Create a “personal operator” category of pilot who may fly 8 or fewer passengers for compensation and not be deemed a “common carrier”
Aviation Empowerment Act bill text
Screening Partnership Reform Act
The Screening Partnership Reform Act would make changes to the Transportation Safety Administration’s (TSA) Screening Partnership Program (SPP), which allows TSA to contract with private companies to carry out its screening services.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has estimated that the program cuts costs for participating airports by 11%, compared to TSA’s screening. However, the full potential of the program has not been unlocked due to a number of policies that disincentivize airports and security companies from participating.
The Screening Partnership Reform Act would clear some of the bureaucratic red-tape surrounding the program in an attempt to unleash the full cost-saving benefits and further innovation within the SPP, while still safeguarding aviation security. In particular, it would:
Statutorily require TSA’s cost estimation process to account for total costs to the federal government
Give airport operators a role in selecting a private screening company for their airport
Allow private screening companies to conduct on-site training rather than traveling to a Federal Law Enforcement Training Center
Allow private screening companies to submit recommendations to TSA on new and innovative approaches to screening
Clarify ambiguities in hiring practices during transition from TSA to private screening
Screening Partnership Reform Act bill text
Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act
The Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act, or ATC SOAR Act, is designed to decrease the number of applicants that flunk out of the air traffic control academy.
In 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted hiring reforms that prioritized diversity quotas over experienced, qualified candidates through implementing a biographical questionnaire. When Congress prohibited the questionnaire in 2016, the FAA then put the biographical assessments into its Air Traffic Skill Assessment (AT-SA) test. The FAA does not report any information on how AT-SA is graded, and more specifically how the biographical questions factor into the overall score an applicant receives.
The ATC SOAR Act would restore common sense hiring practices to keep our skies safe and ensure that qualified, experienced controller candidates are prioritized. Specifically, the bill would:
Instruct the FAA to consider candidates for interviews based on their qualifications and their score on the AT-SA test
Instruct the FAA to revise the AT-SA test to only include peer-reviewed, job-relevant aptitude questions
Prohibit any biographical questions on the AT-SA test other than basic identifiers (first name, last name)
Require the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation to report to Congress an assessment of the test methodology, the aptitude questions, and the scoring methodology

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Drone Integration and Zoning Act
Date: March 24, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced the Drone Integration and Zoning Act (DIZA), a bill to establish a regulatory framework for drones based on the principles of local governance and cooperative federalism.
“
The FAA cannot feasibly or efficiently oversee millions of drones in every locality throughout the country,
”
said Sen. Lee
. “
Further,  its current legal position claiming regulatory authority over every cubic inch of air in the United States – including air just inches above Americans’ private property – is both unsustainable and unlawful. In our constitutional system, the states have sovereign police powers to govern over inherently local issues, including the protection of property, land use, privacy, trespass, and law enforcement. The best way to ensure public safety, protect property rights, and unleash drone innovation is to empower the people closest to the ground to make local decisions in real time, which is exactly what the Drone Integration and Zoning Act does.
”
DIZA seeks to balance the competing airspace authorities between the federal government and the states by more clearly defining the boundaries of the FAA’s authority over the air as well as the proper scope of regulatory authority that federal and state governments exercise over drones operating in the United States. Specifically, it protects the authority of the states to issue time, place, and manner restrictions, while not unreasonably prohibiting access to the federal “navigable airspace”; and it protects the local zoning authority of state, local, or tribal governments to designate commercial drone take-off and landing zones, while still allowing for interstate commerce

Title: Sen. Lee Fights Central Bank Digital Currency
Date: March 24, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced legislation to prevent the Federal Reserve from reshaping the U.S. financial sector and having the ability to monitor consumer transactions. The Fed, with encouragement from the Biden Administration, has begun to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital asset, minted, issued, and controlled by them, that would alter the ability of financial institutions to function as lenders, while giving the federal government knowledge of every purchase that uses a CBDC. Financial institutions could no longer offer loans – or at the very least would be significantly restricted in doing so – since they would bear no risk for a deposit; they would function merely as wallets, holders of a CBDC – and as such, could not extend deposits to prospective borrowers in the form of loans. Lastly, the Federal Reserve would have knowledge of every transaction involving a CBDC; if it maintains the technology to create and operate a CBDC, it will know how it is used.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The United States doesn't need to create a Central Bank Digital Currency to know it is a bad idea. We've seen this play out in China with the digital Yuan. In early trials, China canceled its citizens' money after a set period, forcing Chinese citizens to spend their savings at the compulsion of the government. My bill protects Americans from a similar intrusion by prohibiting the Federal Reserve or any federal government agency from minting or issuing a CBDC, whether through a direct-to-consumer or intermediated model.
”
Nicholas Anthony
and
Norbert Michel
of the Cato Institute mentioned in a recent report, “
The
case against
central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) grows stronger by the day … CBDCs put the future of financial privacy, freedom, and markets at risk, and these bills would provide much needed safeguards against the United States issuing a CBDC. Senator Lee’s bill would establish clear boundaries for not just the Federal Reserve (Fed), but also the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Time and time again, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and former-Vice Chair Lael Brainard
have skirted questions
on the Fed’s authority to issue a CBDC. Likewise, the Treasury seems to have
taken the lead
: on pushing CBDCs forward under the Biden administration. Considering these developments, it’s clear that Senator Lee’s approach is indeed warranted.
“
These bills would establish some much-needed checks on the federal government’s efforts to launch a CBDC. The potential consequences of a CBDC are simply too large to be left up to the discretion of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed or the Treasury. It’s a decision that should rest with Congress.”

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Communities from Drone Threats
Date: March 24, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Stopping Harmful Incidents to Enforce Lawful Drone Use (SHIELD-U) Act to equip state and local law enforcement with the authority needed to protect their citizens and communities from drone threats.
The need to respond to drone threats is increasing as commercial and personal use becomes more widespread. Sen. Lee’s legislation gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with state and local law enforcement, the authority to detect, identify, and mitigate drone threats on commercial service airport property, including the airspace involved in the takeoff and landing of aircraft. It further grants state and local law enforcement similar counter drone authority within their respective jurisdiction.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
State and local law enforcement agencies cannot ensure the safety of their communities when the federal government restricts their ability to respond to active drone threats. Rather than waiting on the federal government, which often lacks the resources and capital to respond to threats effectively, this bill grants local authorities the latitude to quickly identify and mitigate threats

Title: Lee Joins Delegation to Mexico Urging Cooperation on Mutual Security Challenges
Date: March 20, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined a U.S. delegation to Mexico focused on continuing our economic partnership, stopping illicit drug trafficking, curbing illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and addressing China's role in providing precursors for fentanyl production and laundering money for the cartels.
The delegation was led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), and included Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Peter Welch (D-VT) and Reps. Tony Gonzales (TX-23), Henry Cuellar (TX-28), Veronica Escobar (TX-16), and Maria Salazar (FL-27).
The delegation met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and members of his administration. They received briefings from U.S. intelligence officials, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico,
Ken Salazar
.
“
Utah enjoys a strong economic and cultural partnership with Mexico. It was an honor to meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss ways to promote our shared values, advance our shared interests, and secure our shared border
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
I’m grateful for U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar’s leadership and remain optimistic that our delegation’s visit will bolster our security and strengthen our relationship with our southern neighbor.
”
“
The United States and Mexico share a common border, which means we should have a shared interest in working together to address the security challenges that put American and Mexican lives at risk, including drugs, murderous cartels, and unchecked migration
,”
said Sen. Cornyn.
“
Our delegation made clear to President López Obrador that his administration must do more to address these issues so that we can maintain our historically strong economic and cultural partnership, and I am hopeful that our candid conversations will lead to collaborative solutions that make both countries safer and more prosperous.
”
Background:
Mexico is the second-largest trading partner of the U.S. and Utah's third-largest export partner. U.S. trade with Mexico totaled 725.7 billion in 2021 and supported an estimated 1.1 million U.S. jobs.
Utah companies like Autoliv and Malouf have made substantial investments in Mexico, with small businesses in mining, education, and agriculture inputs thriving there. In 2021, Utah's total trade with Mexico totaled nearly $6.7 billion.
In 2021, Utah companies exported more than $1.1 billion in goods to Mexico, a 72% increase in the last decade. In the same year, Utah businesses imported more than $5 billion in goods from Mexico, a 55% increase from the previous decade.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Vulnerable Immigrants
Date: March 7, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Katie Britt (R-AL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the Stopping Border Surges Act
to address
loopholes in our immigration system that encourage vulnerable immigrant populations to take dangerous, illegal paths of entry into the United States. The Stopping Border Surges Act includes reforms that would reduce unsustainable surges of aliens; strengthen our asylum process; eliminate the incentive to send children to the border; and dampen the exploitative power of coyotes and cartels.
“Loopholes in our immigration system perversely compel women and children to entrust their savings, futures, and lives to cartels and coyotes – endangering the safety of vulnerable immigrants, and undermining the integrity of our system,”
said Sen. Lee
.
“This bill would help stop these dangerous opportunities for abuse.”
“Over the last two years, we’ve continued to see a historic number of illegal border crossings and an administration that refuses to address gaps in the law,”
said Sen. Ernst.
“With the White House turning a blind eye to the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border, it is time for Congress to come together and act. This bill will close several loopholes – ones that are being abused by dangerous cartels – and help stop the flood of illegal activity at the border.”
“President Biden’s wide-open southern border has created a disaster. In 2022, there were a record 2.4 million border encounters and more than twice as many deceased migrants were discovered at the border last year than any other year on record,”
said Sen. Daines.
“We must close the dangerous loopholes in our immigration system to protect vulnerable populations that are falling victim to President Biden’s backwards border policies.”
“Our nation is facing a historic national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,”
said Sen. Britt.
“We must end the incentives and close the loopholes that are pushing people to illegally enter our country. The only people benefiting from the current chaos are bad actors, especially the drug cartels. I will continue to fight to keep American families and communities safe.”
“The border crisis brought on by the Biden administration’s policy failures has created an environment ripe for the exploitation of both legal loopholes and migrants,”
said Sen. Grassley.
“Children especially are being used by smugglers, coyotes and the cartels. Closing the loopholes will help protect lives and start reestablishing some order on the southern border.”
Sen. Lee’s bill would eliminate the expansion of the Flores Settlement Agreement by allowing alien children accompanied by parents to be held with that parent for the duration of the parent’s adjudication. This would end the incentive for non-parents to claim an unknown child as their own. It also removes any incentive for parents to bring children with them on the hazardous journey to the U.S. Border. Unfortunately, non-parents are increasingly using children as a get-out-of-jail-free card at the child’s expense. These children are often “recycled” by smugglers forced to cross multiple times to ensure admission for more adults.
The United States currently return unaccompanied children from Mexico and Canada quickly and safely. Children from other countries, however, are placed in a lengthy removal process. They are released into the United States with the same adults that smuggled them into the country. Consequently, the policy incentivizes the enlistment of couriers to smuggle children across the border. Sen. Lee’s legislation ends this incentive by extending the same seamless process available to children from Mexico and Canada.

Title: Sen. Lee Cancels the Coin
Date: March 3, 2023

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Cancel the Coin Act to prohibit the Treasury Secretary from minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin. Federal law does not currently limit the quantity or the individual face value of platinum coins the Treasury could mint and issue. Some view this as permission for the Treasury to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin, or an unspecified number of platinum coins capped at $200, to issue debt to finance government debt obligations and operations.
This loophole could allow the Secretary of the Treasury to bypass the debt ceiling. With an impending standoff, calls for minting a trillion-dollar have
surfaced again
. Rather than face difficult conversations about runaway spending, members of the public and even some Members of Congress have called for the President to bypass the legislative branch entirely by minting a trillion-dollar coin.
Sen. Lee’s legislation would cap the maximum coin value the Secretary can mint or issue at $200. This generous cap would give the Secretary continued leeway to produce unique or commemorative coins that collectors value without undermining the careful separation of powers established by our Founders. Additionally, the legislation would prohibit the Federal Reserve from accepting deposits of platinum coins for the Treasury’s account.
“
Minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin would not only be dangerously inflationary, but it would effectively circumvent Congress’s
constitutionally
mandated duty to manage the purse strings
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
My legislation will remove any potential escape route for an administration that doesn’t want to have a candid conversation about our out-of-control spending.

Title: Lee Bill Makes Travelers Free as a Bird
Date: March 2, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Fair Removal of Existing and Enforced Bans on Immunization Relating to Destination (FREEBIRD) Act to end the COVID-19 vaccine mandate placed on international air visitors to the United States. Foreign travelers, including family members, friends, and business relations, are being kept off U.S. soil due to the air travel vaccine mandate, which remains for nonimmigrant, noncitizen foreign travelers. The United States is one of the only countries that still impose this mandate.
Sen. Lee’s bill declares that the CDC’s requirement “shall have no force or effect” upon the bill’s enactment, prohibits federal funds from being used to carry out the CDC requirement, and prevents the CDC from ordering future COVID-19 vaccine mandates for foreign travelers.
“
President Biden himself declared that the pandemic is over. Why, then, is the United States the only free country requiring international visitors to prove their vaccination status? It makes no sense that we would separate friends and family, damage our tourism industry, and hurt our economy when the world has moved on
,”
said Sen. Lee.
“
It's time for the United States to join with the rest of the free world, reunite friends and family, and allow travelers to be 'free as a bird.
’”
Sen. Lee’s FREEBIRD Act is cosponsored in the Senate by Sens. Roger Marshall (R-KS), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY).
Sen. Lee’s FREEBIRD Act is supported by:
World Trade Center Utah
Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce
Utah Valley Chamber of Commerce
Heritage Action
U.S. Travel Association
Utah Direct Selling Coalition
Alliance for Natural Health USA
Young Living
RidgeCrest Herbals
“
The Alliance for Natural Health USA applauds Senator Mike Lee's introduction of the FREEBIRD Act, which will once again permit our friends and family from abroad to visit the U.S. while retaining freedom of choice over their health
,”
said Gretchen DuBeue, Executive and Legal Director of the Alliance for Natural Health USA.
“
Vaccine mandates are coercive policies that undermine personal freedom, and we greatly appreciate Senator Lee's leadership in dismantling these restrictive policies
.”
“
The Utah Valley Chamber of Commerce believes in and advocates for a free market approach to business with minimal government intervention. Travel, especially interstate travel, is protected in our Constitution and removing the requirement for vaccination allows the free exercise of business
,”
said Curtis Blair, CEO of the Utah Valley Chamber of Commerce.
“
We support Senator Lee’s efforts to align our nation’s COVID-19 foreign visitor requirements with other countries. Utah’s tourism industry represents a vital part of the state’s economy, supporting over 100,000 jobs. This approach provides a boost to tourism across the nation, while ensuring public safety

Title: Japan Misses Deadline. Lee Calls for SOFA Renegotiation
Date: March 1, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke on the Senate floor, calling for a renegotiation of the U.S.—Japan Status of Forces Agreement. On February 2, Sen. Lee demanded that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida transfer Navy Lt. Ridge Alkonis to United States custody no later than February 28 by 11:59 P.M. EST. Sen. Lee promised a public discussion about the U.S.—Japan Status of Forces Agreement should Japan fail to transfer Lt. Alkonis before the deadline. Japan failed to transfer Lt. Ridge Alkonis to U.S. custody in time.
On the U.S. Senate Floor, Sen. Lee said, “
If the Japanese government can't respect our servicemembers and we can't trust them to uphold their commitments, then we are long overdue for a renegotiation of the Status of Forces agreement between our two nations. We must do so to protect our servicemembers, especially if they’re stationed in a country with a Justice system as draconian as Japan.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Ag Producers
Date: February 28, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) led a bipartisan effort to reform agricultural checkoff programs. Joined by Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the bill will make checkoff programs more accountable to contributors. Checkoffs are mandatory Department of Agriculture fees assessed on a per-unit basis that fund boards designed to promote the commodity as a whole. However, checkoff funds are frequently coopted against the interests of some or even a majority of contributors. Countless farmers, ranchers, and other producers have seen their checkoff dollars squandered or used against their interests. This bill would prohibit certain wasteful, anti-competitive, and deceptive behavior from checkoff boards.
“
Checkoff programs are filled with waste and often abuse those who are forced to contribute to their coffers,
”
said Sen. Lee
. “
These common-sense reforms will ensure that checkoff funds promote and protect all ag producers (big and small) who are meant to be served by these programs
.”
“
Farmers and Ranchers are being forced to pay into checkoff programs that often advocate against their best interest and support food system consolidation. These programs need transparency and oversight so a farmer can be sure they aren't required to fund their own demise,
” s
aid Senator Booker
. “
That is why I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation that will help increase transparency and prohibit conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices in these programs.
”
“
The current checkoff system does not provide enough transparency to our farmers on how their hard-earned dollars are used
,”
said Senator Gillibrand
. “
I am committed to ensuring the checkoff programs are modernized and reflect the best interests of our farmers
.”
“
The decades old beef checkoff program is ill-suited to meet the needs of today’s cattle farmers and ranchers,
”
said Bill Bullard, CEO, R-CALF USA
. “
In fact, the program promotes corporate control and globalization over the interests of America’s cattle producers. We applaud Senators Lee and Booker for introducing this legislation to meaningfully reform the beef checkoff program so it can begin working for, rather than against, the American cattle producers.
”
“
For far too long, America's farmers and ranchers have been forced to pay into government checkoff programs, only to see their dollars used against them by trade and lobbying organizations representing the world's largest meatpackers and grain traders
,”
said Farm Action Fund President Joe Maxwell
.“
We applaud Senators Lee and Booker for their continued effort to bring transparency and accountability to these corrupt programs.
”
“
American family farmers are in peril and today, every cent counts,
”
said Taylor Haynes, president of the Organization for Competitive Markets
. “
If we’re going to be forced to pay into USDA’s checkoff programs then the very least we should expect is transparency, accountability, and oversight of our hard-earned dollars, and the OFF Act accomplishes just that.

“
The OFF Act was first introduced in the 115th Congress and here we are in the 118th Congress still working for transparency and accountability to reform the USDA’s commodity checkoff programs,
”
said Deborah Mills, chairwoman of the National Dairy Producers Organization
. “
This speaks volumes about what frustrates producers who are paying into checkoff programs. The recipients of the checkoff dollars are the greatest proponents of maintaining the status quo. Producers are being denied the basic right to have their questions about their investment answered.

“
I don’t want my hard-earned dollars funneled to a quasi-governmental organization that works against my best interest and represents industrial agriculture’s continued movement toward the monopolization of farming,

said Will Harris, past president of the American Grassfed Association and proprietor of White Oak Pastures.
“
We’ve farmed the same land in Georgia since 1866, and I want to ensure that future generations are able to continue to do the same.
”
“W
e applaud Sens. Lee, Booker, Paul, Warren, and Gillibrand for their tireless work and leadership on the Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act
,”
said Marty Irby, executive director at Animal Wellness Action
. “
USDA’s commodity checkoff programs remain under fire because of their lack of transparency, misuse of funds, and damaging anti-competitive practices that have bankrupted millions of American farmers.

Title: Lee Introduces Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: February 16, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced an amendment to the United States Constitution requiring the federal government to balance its budget each year. Sen. Lee has
consistently advocated
for binding, structural spending reforms embedded in a constitutional amendment.
The need for a balanced budget amendment is needed now more than ever. At the beginning of the 118th Congress, the national debt reached $31.38 trillion. For the first time since World War II, the federal public debt has reached 100% of GDP, meaning the federal government will soon owe more in debt than the annual size of the American economy. That number is
projected to double
to 200% by 2050, when our net interest payments will be the
single largest budget item
, exceeding the size of Social Security and Medicare. For perspective, fifteen years ago, the U.S. public debt as a size of our economy was only 35%.
Sen. Lee's amendment would force Congress to balance its budget each year, limit spending to no more than 18% of GDP, and require a supermajority vote in both the House and Senate before raising taxes or increasing the nation’s debt ceiling. Perpetual deficits and debt debilitate economic growth. For all the gains realized through economic expansion, debt, and deficits rob the American people of their future.
Of the amendment,
Sen. Lee said
, “
We cannot rely on self-imposed, statutory spending limits that Congress can waive with a simple majority. To restore fiscal responsibility, we must enact a permanent structural spending restraint. If we want to eliminate deficits, reduce the national debt, reduce spending, preserve our constitutional priorities, and save our economy, it starts with the balanced budget amendment. It is the only solution that guarantees the enforcement of future reforms.

Title: Sen. Lee Makes Debut at Senate Budget Committee
Date: February 15, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) debuted at the
first Senate Budget Committee
hearing of the 118th Congress. Sen. Lee’s appointment to the Budget Committee comes at a time when our federal budget has ballooned to levels not seen since World War II. Of his appointment to the Budget Committee, Sen. Lee expressed his optimism for bipartisan collaboration and deliberating ways to reduce our budget deficits, stabilize our debt, and put our budget on a pathway to balance.
For the first time since World War II, the federal public debt has reached 100% of GDP, meaning the federal government currently owes more than it collects in yearly revenue. That number is
projected to double
to 200% by 2050, when our net interest will be the
single largest budget
item, exceeding the size of Social Security and Medicare. For perspective, fifteen years ago the U.S. public debt as a size of our economy was only 35%.
Just last year, CBO
released a report
noting the very tangible consequences of our skyrocketing federal debt: “
The high and rising federal debt that CBO projects over the next three decades would have serious consequences for the economy and federal budget, including the crowding out of private investment, higher interest costs, and increased risks of a fiscal crisis
.”
In his opening remarks,
Sen. Lee said
, “
I want to take a brief moment to say I appreciate having the opportunity to serve on the Budget Committee at a time when our federal budget has never been in a worse state of disrepair.
”
Sen. Lee continued
, “
This fiscally irresponsible path that our federal budget is on significantly increases the odds of a debt crisis and the associated economic pain that will be borne by the American public.
”
Chairman Whitehouse called the
first Budget Committee hearing
of the 118th Congress to consider “Climate Related Economic Risks and Their Cost to the Federal budget and the Global Economy.”
During the hearing,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Let’s not fool ourselves and the American public: our ballooning deficits and debt have been driven by and will continue to be driven by runaway, profligate spending by the federal government NOT because of any effects of climate change. Fear has become an all-too-prevalent quality in America’s political discourse, and, specifically, among those on the left who seek to use climate alarmism to justify a government takeover of our economy and a radical, unrealistic, and damaging transition of our energy sector
.”
NOTE: On Thursday, February 16, Senator Lee intends to introduce an amendment to the United States Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year. Information regarding Lee’s “Balanced Budget Amendment” is available

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) introduced the Natural Product Industry Week Resolution to highlight the contributions of the natural products industry to the American diet and the economy. The resolution designates October 23 through October 29 as “Natural Products Industry Week.”
Eighty percent of Americans reported using dietary supplements in 2021. Demand for natural products in the U.S. has led to the establishment of numerous direct-selling companies that produce and sell natural products. The increased consumption of dietary supplements has created more than 754,000 domestic jobs and generated $121.6 billion in total U.S. economic output, including $38.4 billion in domestic wages.*
The American Herbal Products Association (AHPA), the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), and the United Natural Products Alliance (UNPA), organizations representing dietary supplement manufacturers, marketers, and ingredient suppliers commended the resolution, noting the importance of dietary supplements and highlighting the natural products industry's contributions to America's health and economy.
“The natural products industry holds a special place in Utah. I remain committed to empowering Utah consumers by ensuring access to these products,” said Sen. Lee. “More options mean more freedom, and I'm proud to sponsor this resolution to recognize the industry's role in bolstering consumers' freedom to choose.”
“The natural products industry is essential to the overall health and wellness, including disease prevention, of the nation. We thank Senators Lee and Sinema for recognizing our industry’s critical role in empowering consumers to make healthcare choices. As champions of the natural products industry, Senators Lee and Sinema have long supported initiatives that allow consumers freedom of choice and access to natural products that will improve their health. We look forward to their continued leadership in keeping FDA accountable on critical industry issues such as NMN, CBD, and enforcement.” -Daniel Fabricant, Ph.D., President and CEO of NPA
“Ortho Molecular Products fully supports the resolution introduced by Senators Lee and Sinema to recognize Natural Products Industry Week. We are proud of our more than 30-year history within the dietary supplement industry, and look forward to many more years supporting healthcare practitioners as they work to transform the practice of medicine. We welcome the resolution because it signifies the important place dietary supplements hold within the lives, and health, of millions of Americans.” –Aaron Bartz, President at Ortho Molecular Products, Inc
“The Alliance for Natural Health USA thanks Senators Mike Lee and Kyrsten Sinema for sponsoring this resolution to designate October 22 through October 28, 2023, as “Natural Product Industry Week.” More than 80% of American households use dietary supplements and other natural products. We hope Congress will advance this resolution and recognize the value of these products in helping Americans support their optimum health.” – Gretchen DuBeau, Executive and Legal Director, Alliance for Natural Health USA
“The American Kratom Association, representing the nearly 15 million Americans who consume kratom, strongly support the Natural Products Industry week resolution, and applaud the bi-partisan leadership of Senators Mike Lee and Kyrsten Sinema in recognizing that Americans should have the freedom to make informed choices about products they choose to use to maintain their health and well-being. Americans have spoken loudly on their responsible use of natural products and this resolution will promote the needed understanding of policy makers on the importance of allowing consumers to use natural products they find to be beneficial to them.” – Mac Haddow, Senior Fellow on Public Policy, American Kratom Association
“We are incredibly grateful to Senator Lee for his clear-eyed support of an industry that is important to millions of people around the world and is a space in which U.S. companies provide technology and brand leadership globally.” – The Utah Direct Selling Coalition

Title: Senate GOP Introduce Concealed-Carry Reciprocity Bill
Date: February 2, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN), along with 42 of their Senate colleagues, introduced the
Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act
, which would allow individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any other state that allows concealed carry, while still abiding by that state’s laws.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
As a proud constitutional carry state, Utah has always valued the right of its people to keep and bear arms. Now, in a post-Bruen world, we have the ammunition to jealously defend the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. It defies logic that we allow individuals to use their home-state license to drive in another state but not concealed carry. I’m proud to cosponsor this commonsense legislation to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Cornyn said,
“
I’m proud to support law-abiding gun owners across America with this commonsense legislation that would let them concealed carry in all states that allow it. This legislation strengthens two of our most fundamental constitutional protections – the Second Amendment’s right of citizens to keep and bear arms and the Tenth Amendment’s right of states to make laws best-suited for their residents – and I’m grateful to 44 of my Republican Senate colleagues for joining me on this important bill.
”
Of the bill,
Sen. Hagerty said,
“
The constitutional right of self-defense should not disappear simply because an individual crosses state lines. I’m pleased to join my Senate colleagues in this commonsense legislation to ensure that law-abiding Tennesseans who are permitted to carry a concealed firearm are able to exercise that right in other states, consistent with those states’ laws, without having to obtain a separate permit
.”
The legislation is also cosponsored by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), John Thune (R-SD), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Boozman (R-AR), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), Ted Budd (R-NC), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Todd Young (R-IN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Mike Braun (R-IN), J.D.

Background on the
Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act
:
Allows individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state to exercise those rights in any other state with concealed carry laws
Treats state-issued concealed carry permits like drivers’ licenses where an individual can use their home-state license to drive in another state, but must abide by that other state’s speed limit or road laws
Protects state sovereignty by not establishing a national standard for concealed carry
This legislation is endorsed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the National Rifle Association.

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and 23 of his Senate colleagues sent
a letter
to President Biden expressing opposition to a debt-ceiling hike without real structural spending reform that reduces deficit spending. The signatories expressed their intention to abide by the policy of the Senate Republican conference, which states that “any increase in the debt ceiling must be accompanied by cuts in federal spending of an equal or greater amount as the debt ceiling increase, or meaningful structural reform in spending, such as the Prevent Government Shutdown Act or the Full Faith and Credit Act.”
The
letter
reads in part, “
Americans are keenly aware that their government is not only failing to work for them – but actively working against them. We do not intend to vote for a debt-ceiling increase without structural reforms to address current and future fiscal realities and manage out-of-control government policies

Title: Lee Reintroduces Bill to Empower Parents of K-12 Students
Date: January 26, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Children Have Opportunities in Classrooms Everywhere (CHOICE) Act to afford low-income families with K-12 students the choice to use federal education funds to
pursue the best educational option
s
for their child(ren). Sens. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Ted Budd (R-NC), Rick Scott (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) cosponsored the legislation.
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was designed to create opportunities for low-income students by providing funding to increase “quality and equality” in education. ESEA is the primary source of federal aid for K-12 education.
The federal government spends more than $20 billion annually through ESEA.
Decades of evidence show that Title I funding through the ESEA has failed to improve academic outcomes or opportunities for low-income students.
Sen. Lee’s bill would allow eligible families to have ESEA funds directed to their child’s public school or deposited into a 529 education savings account for a private school, virtual learning, tutoring, homeschooling curriculums, therapy services, and more.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“C
hildren desperately need every resource at their disposal to attain educational success. My bill ensures that federal K-12 funding goes directly to the student, cutting out the bureaucratic middle-man that has inflated education costs and hindered academic success for far too long. It’s clear that our one-size-fits-all approach has failed. Empowering parents is the best way to give our nation’s children the best education possible
.”
Of the bill, Ryan Walker, Vice President of Government Relations at Heritage Action said, “
For years, many working-class families have had no choice but to send their children to the public school they have been zoned for, regardless of the quality of education it provides. The past few years have magnified this problem, as the Biden Administration and other Democrats insisted on indoctrinating our kids and waged a battle against parents for being involved in education choices. Senator Lee’s CHOICE Act puts these students first by giving families the opportunity to decide what education option works best for them
.”
Of the bill, Parents Defending Education Action
released
the following statement: “
Education choice is fundamentally a parental rights issue. PDE Action firmly believes that all parents—regardless of their socioeconomic status—have the right to make the best educational decisions for their children. Today, we are proud to announce our support for Senator Mike Lee’s “Children Have Opportunities in Classrooms Everywhere” (CHOICE) Act.

Title: Sen. Lee Delivers Message to Utahns

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a message to Utahns as he was sworn in as a member of the 118th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris on the floor of the US Senate, beginning his third term. Many members of Lee’s family attended the ceremony, including his wife, Sharon, and two of their children. Lee family friends were also in attendance.
Per Senate tradition, Sen. Lee was escorted to the Senate floor by fellow Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Lee & Rubio both assumed office together on January 3, 2011.
In his message, Sen. Lee said, “
Having just been sworn in as a member of the 118th Congress, I can only begin to express how honored I am to continue serving as your Senator. I am grateful for the trust and confidence you’ve placed in me to represent you and bring the Utah way to the national stage.
“
Today marks the beginning of a new Congress, bringing a fresh opportunity to restore and renew our nation’s founding principles of federalism and separation of powers.
“
Since arriving in Washington, I’ve witnessed the executive branch’s continued expansion of its powers and influence while Congress neglectfully delegates its Constitutional authority to unelected bureaucrats. This unchecked power creates dangerous consequences, not just for Congress, but for Utah in particular.
“
When Congress abdicates its duty, we neglect the needs of Utahns. As a premier public lands state, Utah deserves not only a seat at the table, but a voice to ensure that we have the means to address a host of issues, including affordable housing.
“
We must restore balance and accountability to the legislative branch of government. This includes reforming the spending process and restoring fiscal responsibility, so Utahns never again have to endure record-high inflation driven by reckless government spending. We must work to reclaim Congress’ rightful powers and ensure our nation remains a beacon of freedom and prosperity.
“
Many challenges do lie ahead, but I remain committed to working and fighting for the issues that matter to the people of Utah and the rest of our great country. I’m committed to standing up for Utah – home of Browning Arms Company – against relentless encroachments on the Second Amendment. I’m committed to defending religious liberty so Utahns can continue to worship according to their sincerely held beliefs. I’m committed to promoting fiscal responsibility, so we do not shackle our children with unbearable debt. Above all, I’m committed to upholding my oath to preserve and defend the Constitution.
“
Thank you again for your support, and I look forward to continuing to serve you in the 118th Congress.”

Title: Lee Amendment Continuing Pay and Benefits to Alkonis Family Unanimously Passes
Date: December 22, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– The Senate unanimously adopted Sen. Mike Lee's (R-UT) amendment to the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which directs the Secretary of the Navy to continue the pay and benefits of Navy Lt. Ridge Alkonis.
While serving in Japan, Lt. Alkonis was involved in a deadly car accident caused by the sudden onset of Acute Mountain Sickness. Subsequently, the Japanese court sentenced him to three years imprisonment. Sen. Lee expressed his deepest sympathies for the victims' families while noting that an American servicemember should not be disproportionately punished for an accident resulting from a medical emergency.
The Navy informed Lt. Alkonis that due to Department accounting rules, his pay and benefits would continue only until his leave expired. With his leave expiring on December 28, he faced losing compensation and his family's access to benefits.
Sen. Lee drafted the amendment after the Department of Defense failed to grant an Exception to Policy request that would have continued his pay and benefits. Sen. Lee's amendment directs the Secretary of the Navy to continue the pay and benefits of Lt. Alkonis and his family.
On the passage of his amendment,
Sen. Lee said
, “
I'm grateful to my Senate colleagues for standing with the family of Navy Lt. Ridge Alkonis. As Lt. Alkonis sits in a Japanese prison on the eve of Christmas, we cannot leave his family wondering how they will feed themselves or keep a roof over their heads.

Title: Sen. Mike Lee, 10 Colleagues Urge Pentagon to Freeze COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Discharges, Reinstate Discharged Soldiers with Backpay
Date: December 16, 2022

Washington, D.C.
– Today, following the Senate’s approval of the National Defense Authorization act (NDAA), Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) joined his colleagues in a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The Senators urged Secretary Austin to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges, and to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits.
Senators James Lankford, Mike Braun, John Hoeven, Jim Risch, Lindsey Graham, Mike Crapo, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio all co-signed the letter.

or below.
December 16, 2022
The Honorable Lloyd Austin
Secretary
U.S. Department of Defense
1000 Defense Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20301
Dear Secretary Austin:
Now that the Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the legislation heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. This year’s NDAA, which provides essential funding and sets defense and national security policy for the United States, also contains a key provision we fought for which eliminates the requirement for service members to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While we are proud to see this needed change included, simply reversing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is insufficient to right the wrongs done to our service members. We write today to urge immediate action from the Pentagon to protect our service members and provide much-needed direction and stability for America’s brave heroes and their families.
On December 7th, NBC News cited senior military and defense officials in its reporting that discussions about allowing the reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine are underway at the Pentagon.[1] This is welcome news. The Pentagon must take every action necessary to undo the harm American service members and their families suffered when they were forcibly discharged from service. We urge you to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits. Doing so would provide the clarity and stability American service members and their families deserve.
Additionally, we urge you to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges. Many service members are in limbo, and are facing discharge for their refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine just as Congress is removing the vaccine requirement. As the Secretary of Defense, you have the power to immediately end the uncertainty these members are feeling. All branches of our military are facing significant recruiting problems, including problems arising from the vaccine requirement. Therefore, it is in our readiness and security interests to keep these brave men and women within our ranks. Moving forward with discharges over a requirement that has been rescinded by Congress would be deeply misguided.
Thousands of brave men and women were harmed because of the Pentagon’s misguided approach to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. You have the opportunity to immediately begin undoing the harm caused. For the current and future morale and benefit our Armed Forces, we urge you to act immediately.
We appreciate your attention, and look forward to clarity from the Pentagon on this important issue.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act
Date: December 14, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act to establish a national definition of obscenity that would apply to obscene content transmitted via interstate or foreign communications.
Obscenity is not protected under the First Amendment and is prohibited from interstate or foreign transmission. The Supreme Court, however, has struggled to define obscenity, and its current definition under the "Miller Test" runs into serious challenges when applied to the internet.
Sen. Lee's bill would define "obscenity" within the Communications Act of 1934. Additionally, it would also strengthen the existing prohibition on obscenity by removing the "intent" requirement that only prohibits the transmission of obscenity to abuse, threatens, or harassing a person.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Children Online
Date: December 14, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen.
Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Shielding Children's Retinas from Egregious Exposure on the Net (SCREEN) Act, which would direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue a rule requiring all commercial pornographic websites to adopt age verification technology to ensure
children
cannot access
pornographic content.
At the time of Sen. Lee's SCREEN Act introduction, seventeen states have recognized pornography as a public health
crisis
leading to a broad range of individual, societal, and public health impacts. Congress's past attempts to prevent children from accessing online pornography have, by
and
large, failed First Amendment scrutiny. Sen. Lee
curated this bill to utilize
vast technological improvements,
giving this legislation
good legal ground to pass
the Supreme Court's requirement that the government use
the least restrictive means to achieve its interests.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
Every day, we're learning more about the negative psychological effects pornography has on minors. Given the alarming rate of teenage exposure to pornography, I believe the government must act quickly to enact protections that have a real chance of surviving First Amendment scrutiny. We require age verification at brick-and-mortar shops. Why shouldn't we require it online?

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Biggs Lead Effort to Require COVID-19 Vaccine Transparency
Date: December 1, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) introduced bills that would prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from placing any vaccine for COVID-19 on the child and adolescent immunization schedule unless the Secretary provides clinical data relating to the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
Sens. Rubio and Hagerty joined as cosponsors to Sen. Lee’s version in the Senate.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Parents, not Washington bureaucrats, are in the best position to determine what’s in their child’s best interest. Government should empower parents with as much information as possible to make informed medical decisions for their children. Instead, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending the addition of the COVID-19 vaccine booster shot to the child and adolescent immunization schedule without releasing the full extent of its associated clinical, safety, and efficacy data. Parents deserve access to this vital information. I’m grateful for the opportunity to team up with Representative Biggs to ensure we equip parents with all the information available to make the best decisions concerning their children’s health and well-being.
”
Of the bill,
Rep. Biggs said
, “
Recommending an ineffective vaccine on a demographic largely unaffected by a disease is medical malpractice. Data reveals that COVID-19 vaccines do not effectively prevent contraction or transmission of COVID. Further, imposing these experimental vaccines on children—a demographic virtually unaffected by COVID—is anti-science and mortally twisted. Parents—not unelected, Big Pharma loyalists—should have the final say in medical decisions for their children. I’m grateful to join forces with Senator Lee to ensure our government does not implement these tyrannical mandates.

Title: Sen. Lee & Colleagues Write to Leader McConnell: “No Additional Spending …”
Date: November 30, 2022

Content:
WASHINGTON
- Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and colleagues delivered
a letter
to Leader Mitch McConnell expressing the need to pass a short-term Continuing Resolution that funds the federal government ONLY until shortly after the 118th Congress is sworn in. In the letter signed by Senators Lee, Cruz, Scott of Florida, and Braun, the Senators said in part:
“The undersigned stand with the voters. We believe it would be both imprudent, and a reflection of poor leadership, for Republicans to ignore the will of the American people and rubber stamp an omnibus spending bill that funds ten more months of President Biden’s agenda without any check on his reckless policies that have led to a 40-year high in inflation. Since taking office, President Biden has overseen a $4.8 trillion increase in the national deficit, costing the average American household an estimated $753 more a month. It should be up to the new Congress to set spending priorities for the remainder of this fiscal year.”
The Senators concluded their letter by stating,
“Now is the time for Republicans to get serious about leading America towards a better future
. The current Continuing Resolution funds the federal government through December 16, 2022. We must not accept anything other than a short-term Continuing Resolution that funds the federal government until shortly after the 118
th
Congress is sworn in.  No additional spending, no additional policy priorities should be included. Any urgent items that require the Senate’s attention should be considered separately and under their own terms.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act
Date: November 17, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act to increase competition within the biological drug market and reduce consumer costs.
For small-molecule drugs, pharmacists can substitute generics in lieu of their branded counterparts. Access to generics is essential to increasing competition and bringing down the cost of prescription drugs for patients.
The generic equivalent of a biological drug is known as a biosimilar. Unlike generic drugs, many states will not allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar unless the FDA declares it to be “interchangeable.” This process is cumbersome and expensive.
Acquiring interchangeable status requires the product to undergo switching studies whereby participants must alternate between the biologic and the biosimilar. These studies can cost millions of dollars and further delay market access. After examining 15 years of data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently stated, that switching studies are unnecessary for biosimilars to obtain interchangeable status.
Sen. Lee’s bill would prohibit the FDA from requiring biosimilars to undergo switching studies to receive an “interchangeable” designation. Eliminating this barrier would increase access to lower-cost biosimilars and save payers and consumers billions over the next five years.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
Our regulatory environment is making it too difficult and expensive for biosimilars to make it to the market. Ultimately, it’s the patients who suffer from a lack of competition and high drug prices. My bill, the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act, would bring down the barriers preventing consumers from accessing these life-changing drugs.
”
Of the bill,
Professor Sarfaraz Niazi
, who has extensively written and studied biosimilars, said, “
I fully support the Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act introduced by Senator Lee to forbid the FDA from requiring additional switching and alternating studies in patients to allow interchangeability. According to the FDA, ‘biosimilars have no clinically meaningful difference with their reference product,’ so if there is no difference, they should be interchangeable without the extensive and expensive switching and alternating studies in patients. First, such studies can never fail, as statistics teaches us and as the hundreds of such studies reveal. These studies are tantamount to human abuse. Creating two classes of biosimilars has weakened the trust in biosimilars. The amendments suggested in the bill are based on scientific and ethical considerations, and it must be voted in by the Senate.
”
Of the bill,
Beau Sorensen
, Chief Operating Officer of First Choice Home Health & Hospice in Utah, said, “
With healthcare costs continuing to increase, we are grateful for Senator Lee's leadership in helping patients get access to lower-cost biosimilar drugs by eliminating the red tape and unnecessary studies and steps that go into gaining FDA certification. This will be a huge help to our patients as they look to stay out of higher cost care settings through better access to affordable medications.
”
Of the bill,
Heather Andrews,
State Director, Americans for Prosperity Utah, said, "
Sen. Mike Lee’s Biosimilar Red Tape Elimination Act is a common-sense proposal to bring down the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. For years, the FDA has required drug developers to spend millions on unnecessary “switching” studies. This requirement provides zero benefits to patients in terms of safer and more effective medicine and only makes it harder for patients to afford essential health care.  We urge Congress to enact this badly needed reform."

Title: Lee Bill Protects Victims of Image-Based Sexual Abuse
Date: September 30, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the PROTECT Act, which would require pornography sites to verify the age of all participants in pornographic images; require sites to obtain verified consent forms from individuals uploading content and those appearing in uploaded content; and mandate that websites quickly remove images upon receiving notice they uploaded without consent.
Sen. Lee’s bill comes as Utah law enforcement announced a 600% increase in cases involving child pornography and sexual contact with minors since 2020. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported a 35% increase in child sexual abuse material compared to 2020. Online pornography is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing industries yet has remained largely immune from regulation.
Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “
Pornography sites need to do more to prevent the exploitation that is occurring on their platforms and allow individuals to remove images shared without their consent. The PROTECT Act is a step in that direction
.”
The PROTECT Act has garnered the support of several organizations, in addition to hundreds of victims of image-based sexual abuse.
The following victims met with Senator Lee and provided important feedback on the PROTECT Act.
Of the bill, Survivor Katelynn Spencer said, “
When I found out there have been two sexual videos of me posted on Pornhub and other pornography websites for the past 12 years, not once did I feel protected by the law. There are no laws in my state to protect survivors of image-based sexual abuse, but if this bill was and is put in place, it could help so many survivors like me
.”
Of the bill, Survivor Uldouz Wallace said, “T
echnology is updating everyday but the laws haven’t changed. We need the Protect Act because it will protect the future of our children, women, men and ensure that the internet is a safer environment
.”
Of the bill, Survivor Victoria Galy said, “
Online criminal enterprises have been allowed to flourish unregulated for over a decade. Technology has surpassed the reach of our current laws. The internet and technology have become weapons in digital violence. We desperately need a federal law to protect victims against online image-based sexual abuse including edited and deepfake content. The Protect Act would provide this protection. Similar laws have already been passed in other countries and the U.S. is falling behind

Title: Lee Introduces the Bipartisan Puerto Rico Recovery Act
Date: September 29, 2022

Content:
In the wake of Hurricane Fiona, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), introduced the Puerto Rico Recovery Act, a bill requiring the Department of Homeland Security to waive the Jones Act for vessels or operators reasonably demonstrating their intention to provide disaster relief to Puerto Rico. The waivers would be valid for one year or until the end of the Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico, whichever comes first. The bill was introduced by Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) in the House.
The bill comes at a time when the White House had to delay a Jones Act waiver for a diesel vessel awaiting entry into Puerto Rico. Secretary Mayorkas finally granted the waiver on September 28th, citing a cumbersome case-by-case process as the reason for the delay. This legislation establishes a swift Jones Act waiver approval process which will help ensure full and continued relief to the territory of Puerto Rico.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
We cannot allow the Jones Act to delay relief to Puerto Ricans trying to recover from the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Fiona. Failing to act while much of the territory is without power is unconscionable. My bill would provide quick access to resources waiting to enter Puerto Rico without unnecessary delay

Title: Bipartisan FORMULA 2.0 Heads to President’s Desk
Date: September 29, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) in conjunction with Sens. Mike Braun (R-IN), Todd Young (R-IN), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ), spearheaded efforts to pass the Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act to further ease the infant formula shortage in the United States. The bill passed the House on the suspension calendar and is now headed to the President’s desk for signature.
The shutdown of the Abbott plant resulted in a nationwide formula shortage and highlighted significant problems in our regulatory process. In May, reports showed that the national out-of-stock rate jumped to 74%. While reports show the stock rate has improved, many retailers are still limiting how much formula families can buy.
In July, Sen. Lee’s FORMULA Act was signed into law by President Biden. Sen. Lee’s legislation temporarily suspended the tariff for imported formulas. Formula companies have communicated this tariff relief played a massive role in their ability to bring more formula to the United States.
The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act continues the progress of the FORMULA Act by temporarily waiving tariffs on infant formula base powder. This bill will help domestic manufacturers increase their production, thus further easing the formula crisis in the United States.
Of the bill, Senate leads Lee, Braun, Young, and Menendez said, “
We've made significant progress in alleviating the American formula crisis, but there's still work to do. The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act targets another critical component of formula availability by temporarily waiving tariffs on infant formula base powder. This bill will help domestic manufacturers increase their formula production, and ensuring that American babies don't go unfed.
”
Of the bill, House leads DelBene, Blumenauer, Smith, Larson, Kildee, and Ferguson said, “
The passage of this legislation today is a huge win for families and will be a powerful tool in addressing the ongoing baby formula shortage. This measure, combined with the Formula Act that Congress approved in July, will help get more safe, affordable formula on store shelves and increase domestic production capacity. We thank our colleagues in the House and Senate for their overwhelming bipartisan support on this measure. This shows how we can put families first and show Americans governance can work for them.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Roll Back Price Controls
Date: September 27, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protecting Drug Innovation Act to roll back the federal government’s authority to set drug prices covered by Medicare. The power to set drug prices was a key component of the Democrat’s so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” that passed through Congress without a single Republican vote.
Sen. Lee’s legislation follows a recent report by the Joint Economic Committee that finds shortages, rationing, quality reductions, and higher inflation always accompany government attempts to fix prices.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects price control provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will lead to the introduction of fifteen fewer life-saving drugs over the next thirty years. The JEC report concludes this will result in the equivalent of up to 1.9 million people losing a full decade of life over the next 30 years.
Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “Price controls never work. Instead, they exacerbate the problems they seek to resolve. Mandating fixed prescription drug prices will ultimately result in the shortening of American lives. Instead of repeating past mistakes, it’s time we address what’s driving the cost of prescription medications and adopt a regulatory environment that works to everyone’s advantage.”

Title: Republican Senators Urge House Republicans to Support Antitrust Reform Package
Date: September 26, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Chuck Grassley (R- IA), urged their colleagues in the House to support passage of an antitrust reform package consisting of the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, and the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act. The bills would protect antitrust enforcement by state attorneys general, modernize the Hart-Scott-Rodino merger filing fees, and require merging parties to disclose subsidies from certain foreign governments, respectively.
The Senators issued the following joint statement:
“
This package represents a strong, bipartisan consensus approach to strengthening enforcement of the federal antitrust laws, against both Big Tech and other bad actors. Importantly, these bills improve antitrust enforcement without appropriating any more funds to President Biden’s out-of-control FTC. We call on all of our colleagues in the House of Representatives to strongly support this package.

Title: Lee Amendment: No More Special Treatment for China
Date: September 21, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) introduced an amendment
declaring that China is not a developing country and should not be treated by the UN or other intergovernmental organizations as such. The amendment would also require the Secretary of State to propose the removal of China’s designation as a developing nation under the Kigali Amendment.
Sen. Lee’s amendment passed the Senate by a unanimous roll call vote.
The Kigali Amendment restricts supplies of compounds called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are the refrigerants used in most air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The rationale is that HFCs leaking out of equipment and into the atmosphere contribute to climate change.
Treating China as a developing country under the treaty gives it an unfair advantage in the existing HFC market. Further, it allows China to continue production and undercut the HFC market well into the 2040s. As the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China has a long history of disregarding environmental standards and has continually increased its emissions and investments in coal-fired power plants since the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Of the Amendment,
Sen. Lee said,
“
This is part of a conspicuous trend on China’s part. China wants to get ahead by playing by a different set of rules than the rest of the world. We know China ignores the rules and has little respect for international norms, and yet we continue to allow them to dominate markets with the financial support of American taxpayer dollars.

Additionally, Sen. Lee led the debate surrounding the Coast Guard’s vaccine mandate. Sen. Lee offered an amendment that would have prevented the Coast Guard from discharging service men and women from the U.S. Coast Guard for declining to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Several members of the Coast Guard are facing discharge at a time when our armed forces are facing personnel shortages.
Lee’s amendment would prohibit the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in the United States Coast Guard, including active duty, reserves, cadets, and civilian workers. The amendment would reinstate members who have been discharged and require the Coast Guard to adopt the CDC’s most recent COVID-19 prevention guidance. The amendment was defeated.
During the markup, Sen. Lee said, “We cannot possibly contemplate allowing the discharge of thousands of our service men and women who have not committed a single crime. To the contrary, they are responsible for saving thousands of American lives each year. These Americans deserve better from us.”

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. Grassley, Blackburn, Tillis, Cotton, Lummis, Cruz, and Scott, sent a
letter
to Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan expressing concerns over the agency’s use of unpaid consultants. Earlier that month an FTC Inspector General report found that the FTC, despite making wide use of unpaid consultants, lacked any organized policy or procedures to prevent “unpaid consultants and experts involvement in inherently governmental functions.” The letter asked the FTC to respond to a series of questions to assist Congress in its oversight of the agency. Chairwoman Khan responded on September 9th.
The FTC’s
responses
and
supporting materials
revealed that five of its unpaid consultants are current or former employees of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit funded by progressive philanthropy organizations like the Omidyar Network, Ford Foundation, and MacArthur foundation. In addition, three of FTC’s unpaid consultants are concurrently working for tech companies that compete with companies subject to FTC jurisdiction.
Of the response,
Sen. Lee
said,
“These are inexcusable conflicts of interest, and call for vigorous congressional oversight,”
Sen. Lee continued,
“We cannot surrender our antitrust enforcement policy to far-left activists. I look forward to addressing these concerns with Chairwoman Khan next week.”

Title: Senator Lee Introduces the No CBDC Act
Date: September 14, 2022

Content:
Senator Lee introduced
legislation
to prevent the Federal Reserve from reshaping the U.S. financial sector and spying on every consumer transaction. The Fed, with encouragement from the Biden Administration, has begun to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a cryptocurrency, minted, issued, and controlled by them, that would alter the ability of financial institutions to function as lenders, while giving the federal government knowledge of every purchase that uses a CBDC. Financial institutions could no longer offer loans since they would bear no risk for a deposit – they would function merely as wallets, holders of a CBDC – and as such, could not extend deposits to prospective borrowers in the form of loans. Moreover, since the Federal Reserve would be the sole operator and overseer of a U.S. CBDC, the bank would have knowledge of every purchase using the cryptocurrency; if it maintains the technology needed to create the CBDC, it will know how it is used.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Communities from Drone Threats
Date: September 7, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Stopping Harmful Incidents to Enforce Lawful Drone Use (SHIELD-U) Act to equip state and local law enforcement with the authority needed to protect their citizens and communities from drone threats.
The need to respond to drone threats is increasing as commercial and personal use becomes more widespread. Sen. Lee’s legislation gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with state and local law enforcement, the authority to detect, identify, and mitigate drone threats on commercial service airport property, including the airspace involved in the takeoff and landing of aircraft.
It further grants state and local law enforcement similar counter drone authority within their respective jurisdiction.
Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “
State and local law enforcement agencies cannot ensure the safety of their communities when the federal government restricts their ability to respond to active drone threats. Rather than waiting on the federal government, which often lacks the resources and capital to respond to threats effectively, this bill grants local authorities the latitude to quickly identify and mitigate threats.

– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) opposes President Biden’s plan to cancel a portion of federal student debt. Lee offered the statement below following the plan’s announcement.
"
President Biden’s plan to cancel student debt is yet another reckless spending policy during a period of dangerous inflation. This plan will hurt everyone, including those the policy purports to help. Canceling debt will do little to ease America’s economic burden and will instead fuel inflation, increase the cost of education, and further the divide between the rich and poor. This sets a dangerous precedent and misleads future borrowers who presume additional forgiveness is inevitable."

Title: Lee Laments Democrat’s Rejection of PILT Amendment
Date: August 6, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) lamented the rejection of his amendment to the so-called Inflation Reduction Act that would have instituted a supplemental PILT payment over the next ten years.
In Utah, the federal government owns 66.48% of the total land. Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) are federal payments to local governments designed to offset losses in property taxes due to nontaxable federal lands within their boundaries. However, these payments are far lower than what local governments could expect to collect in property taxes. To regard PILT payments as tax equivalents in Utah cities, they would need to be 262 times larger.
Sen. Lee's amendment would have increased PILT payments by nearly 10%. Due to the unprecedented inflation caused by the Biden administration, local governments need this forgone revenue more than ever.
Sen. Lee said,
"
For far too long, the federal government has short-changed local governments who have had to forgo property taxes due to massive swaths of federal land within their boundaries. Locals have experienced profound losses in revenue under a system that is not equitable or fair. My amendment would have helped alleviate this imbalance. While not a full tax equivalent, President Biden's policies have created record-breaking inflation, and local governments need the help now
.
It’s a shame that Democrats, particularly those with constituencies who stand to benefit from this amendment, have voted to continue short-changing Americans.”

Title: Lee Denounces So-Called “Inflation Reduction Act”
Date: August 6, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee denounced Senate Democrat's passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The bill spends hundreds of billions of dollars and raises taxes at a time when inflation has grown to 9.1% nationally and nearly 15% in Utah.
Democrats passed President Biden's legislation through what's known as the budget reconciliation process, meaning the bill could pass with a simple majority rather than the sixty votes customarily needed to advance legislation.
The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Inflation Reduction Act will raise taxes by $313 billion over the next ten years. The Penn Wharton budget model broke this down and concluded that this bill has no deficit reduction until at least 2027.
Sen. Lee was joined by all of his Republican colleagues in rejecting the legislation.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
"
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and you certainly shouldn't judge this bill by its title. Despite its name, this bill will not reduce inflation."
Sen. Lee continued,
"American families cannot afford the Biden administration's latest tax and spend scheme. If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, then spending more money and increasing taxes to reduce inflation meets that definition.
"
Ahead of the late-night kickoff of the amendment process known as vote-a-rama, various GOP Senators took to the Senate floor to voice their opposition to the bill.
Sen. Crapo (R-ID) said
, “
It's too many taxes, too much spending, too big of a burden on American people across all income categories. if anything, the taxes will drive prices up. Madam president, I encourage all of my colleagues to reject this reckless bill.
”
Sen. Lankford (R-OK) said
, “
It doesn't reduce the deficit. They joined in the chorus talking about the beauty of the emperor's new clothes. I'm willing to say what a lot of people in this room know in their gut but they're afraid to say, it doesn't reduce inflation, it doesn't reduce the deficit, the emperor has no clothes. Let's reject this bill.”
Sen. Blackburn (R-TN) said
, “
These hundreds of billions of dollars will serve a purpose, but not to reduce inflation or bring relief. Blue states, unions, radical activists will once again come out on top. Meanwhile, families, working hard to make ends meet, workers, business owners, local leaders are still on the verge of losing everything.”
Sen. Portman (R-OH) said
, “
The nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, not a partisan group, nonpartisan, says this will hurt Americans in every tax bracket. They say more than half of the burden of the over $300 billion in new taxes will fall on folks making less than $400,000 a year. Well, that directly contradicts promises made not to increase taxes on Americans at that level

– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a Resolution designating the week of November 7
th
as “National Pregnancy Center Week.” Pregnancy Resource Centers are a vital resource to women across the country, providing a wide range of healthcare services to those in need. Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) introduced a companion resolution in the House.
Of the Resolution,
Sen. Lee said,
“
In light of recent attacks on pregnancy centers across the country, this timely resolution recognizes the unsung heroes dedicated to providing critical services to women across the country. These centers go above and beyond the call of duty, providing services such as free pregnancy testing, ultrasounds, counseling, and education. I’m humbled by their efforts and honored to support their life-affirming work
.”
The full list of Senate cosponsors includes: Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC),  Mike Braun (R-IN), James Risch (R- ID), Deb Fischer (R- NE), Ted Cruz (R- TX), Marco Rubio (R- FL), Josh Hawley (R- MO), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R- MS), Tommy Tuberville (R- AL), Roger Wicker (R- MS), Ben Sasse (R- NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), James Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tod Young (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Tim Scott (R-SC).
Support from outside groups includes: the Susan B. Anthony List, March for Life, CatholicVote, Heritage Action, Family Research Council, U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, Catholic Charities USA, Pregnancy Medical Clinic/Journey Clinic, Pregnancy Resource Center of Salt Lake City.
Hon. Marilyn Musgrave of SBA Pro-Life America said,
“
Over 2,700 pregnancy centers across the country lovingly provide hope, encouragement, and vital medical and material support for women and families. We commend Senator Lee and Congressman Good for highlighting the important work these nonprofits do by recognizing ‘National Pregnancy Center Week.’ We hope all of Congress will join them, and we thank them for their continued courage and commitment to protecting unborn children and mothers.
”
Jeanne F. Mancini, President of March for Life said,
“
Pregnancy Resource Centers perform lifesaving and life-changing work across our nation every day, providing free resources and compassionate support to women and families in need. In this post-Roe era, such work should be applauded. Instead, these centers are being targeted by the far left with an increasing number of attacks involving violence and vandalism, and they are the subject of a harmful misinformation campaign. We are grateful to Senator Mike Lee and Representative Bob Good for introducing this timely resolution heralding the heroic and transformative contributions of Pregnancy Resource Centers
.”
Tom McClusky, Director of Government Affairs of CatholicVote said,
“
For decades pregnancy resource centers have disproven the lie that those who are pro-life only care for the unborn. In every state these centers greatly outnumber the abortion mills - all while offering guidance, shelter and much needed support to parents and children. PRCs are the very powerful heart of the pro-life movement, which is why Democrats and their allies target them with violence and threats
.”
Mary Szoch, Director of the Center for Human Dignity of Family Research Council said,
“
Each year, thousands of women find themselves unexpectedly pregnant with no one to turn to. Pregnancy resource centers (PRC) provide vital support for these women offering free ultrasounds, STD testing, parenting classes, post-abortion support, diapers, baby clothes, and most importantly a loving, listening friend. From the moment a woman enters a PRC, she is surrounded with compassion, support, and care. The work of these centers changes the lives of many women and saves the lives of countless children. Now that
state laws protecting life in the womb are going into effect, the work of PRCs supporting moms and their babies is more important than ever. Many more moms will experience the gift of life—and PRCs will be right there to help them every step of the way. Family Research Council is proud to support PRCs across the country and is grateful to Sen. Lee and Rep. Good for their resolution calling for national recognition of this heroic work
.”
Heartbeat International issued a statement saying,
“
We thank Representative Good and Senator Lee for celebrating the vital work that pregnancy help centers do every day. As we have entered into a post-Roe world, the work of these centers is all the more important as they walk alongside families throughout the pregnancy and beyond, blessing them with pregnancy tests, emotional support, ultrasounds, parenting classes, and so much more at no cost. We at Heartbeat International are proud to partner with pregnancy help centers as they offer true compassion and support so that a woman never feels alone, coerced, or so hopeless that she ends her child’s life through abortion
.”
Anthony Granado of Catholic Charities USA said,
“
We appreciate the attention of Sen. Lee and the U.S. Senate to the plight of women and families facing unexpected pregnancies that may leave them in straitened circumstances. As one of the nation’s largest social services providers, Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) supports those policies, agencies and initiatives that shine a light on the needs of pregnant women and their children, especially those who are living on the margins and facing an increasingly tentative daily existence. We also continue to call for strong social supports — including food, health and housing policies — that uplift and promote the welfare of all. This call is consistent with our Catholic faith and values, with our mission to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and with the teachings of the Gospels.

Title: Lee Amendments Bolster Child Online Safety
Date: July 28, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– During a markup focused on protecting children’s online privacy, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) offered thirteen amendments, nine of which the Senate Commerce Committee adopted. Lee’s amendments were adopted as part of Sen. Blumenthal’s (D- CT) and Sen. Blackburn’s (R-TN) Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and provide additional regulatory safeguards and protections for children online. Sen. Lee voted in favor of pushing KOSA out of committee while noting the work still needed to improve the bill.
Sen. Lee’s amendments bolster KOSA by strengthening transparency surrounding risks posed to children. It adds flexibility and clarifies algorithmic child safeguards. The amendments contain regulatory aspects that protect from overly burdensome regulations while defending intellectual property. Additionally, they restrict unelected FTC bureaucrats from mission creep.
Of his amendments,
Sen. Lee said,
“
I have long been concerned with protecting children online, and it remains one of my most important priorities. I believe that we are at our best when we carefully consider our legislative response, don’t rush a complicated product, and openly debate the complex issues before us
.”
Sen. Lee continued,
“
So, I look forward to working with my colleagues post-markup with the anticipation that we can resolve these issues, advance this bill on the floor, and most importantly – protect the safety of children online.

Title: Sen. Lee Calls for the Release of Lt. Alkonis

Washington, D.C. -
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) called upon U.S. officials to negotiate with their Japanese counterparts and secure the release of Lt. Ridge Alkonis. While serving in Japan, Lt. Alkonis was involved in a deadly car accident that the U.S. Navy determined was caused by the sudden onset of Acute Mountain Sickness. Subsequently, the Japanese court sentenced him to three years imprisonment. Sen. Lee expressed his deepest sympathies for the victims’ families while noting that an American servicemember should not be disproportionately punished for an accident resulting from a medical emergency.
Of Lt. Alkonis’s imprisonment,
Sen. Lee said,
“
I find it nothing short of inexcusable that an American who experienced a medical emergency should be treated so poorly by an allied nation that he’s protecting.

Title: University of Utah Research Park Act Passes Committee
Date: July 21, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
- Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) University of Utah Research Park Act passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today with a bipartisan vote. This bill would preserve the University of Utah’s nearly 600-acre research park and avoid possible action by the Bureau of Land Management to repurpose the land. Research Park is a center for research and development serving both the University and the local workforce. Research Park is situated on a parcel of land which was transferred to the University by the Bureau of Land Management in 1968. Sen. Lee’s bill would remove an encumbrance from that land patent to ensure Research Park remains productive and thriving. The bill is now eligible for consideration by the full Senate.
Sen. Lee said
, “
This simple fix will protect the good work and learning that takes place at Research Park. The Park is home to cutting-edge companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, and manufacturing spaces. The work they do provides for innovation in their fields and offers first-class opportunities for students to work and learn alongside experts. For the good of Utah and the world, this work must continue.
”
After sponsoring companion legislation in the House,
Rep. Chris Stewart said
, “
The important work being done at the University of Utah provides our state with invaluable innovations. I’m proud to stand beside Senator Lee in support of this legislation. And I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in protecting research that will continue to benefit communities across the country.
”
University of Utah President Taylor Randall said
, “Since its establishment in 1968, Research Park has become a key component in the university’s mission to foster innovation, advance science and contribute to Utah’s strong economy. The forethought of state and federal leaders in making this investment of land to the university has reaped extraordinary success and resulted in a myriad of scientific discoveries and companies that have improved the health and well-being of all Americans. This public-private partnership remains a case study in how major research universities can contribute to the success of their communities. I support this legislation and the resulting positive impact it will have on the university and our state.”
In a letter to Sen. Lee,
Utah Governor Spencer Cox said
, “
I appreciate your sponsorship of The University of Utah Research Park Act to help Utah and the University of Utah to clean up an encumbrance to the University’s ownership and use of land for Research Park.” Gov. Cox continued, “I appreciate your hard work and attention to the needs of our state.
”
In a letter to Sen. Lee,
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said
, “
On behalf of Salt Lake City, I support this legislation and look forward to continued partnerships that enhance the quality of life and opportunities for the citizens of Salt Lake.

Title: Sen. Lee’s FORMULA Act Heads to President’s Desk
Date: July 21, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– The United States Senate unanimously passed Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) FORMULA Act.
The bill
, which removes import tariffs on baby formula and baby formula input products until the end of this year now heads to the President’s desk.  The House of Representatives had previously modified and passed the bill resulting in Senate reconsideration.
The national baby formula crisis has only worsened in recent weeks with millions of American families struggling to feed their infants.  The out-of-stock rate in Utah stores has reached as high as 90% during the crisis.
Senator Lee’s complete plan to combat the crisis
includes the tariff suspension among other solutions.
Of the bill’s passage,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Passing the FORMULA Act will be an incredible win for families and hungry babies nationwide. It will make meaningful headway that is desperately needed today. By suspending the tariff on formula imports, we are providing cheaper access to formulas to individual consumers and retailers alike.
” Lee continued, “
This relief has been long overdue, particularly for Utahns, who have the largest families, the most children per capita, and the highest birth rate in the nation.”
Lead House sponsor,
Chairman Earl Blumenaur (D-OR) said
, “
Suspending tariffs on the importation of infant formula and relieving parents of steep price increases is a critical step to ending the infant formula shortage. This crisis requires a whole government response. The Biden Administration has taken important steps to increase supply and I applaud the FDA’s actions to import more formula. Now Congress must act to temporarily remove tariff barriers so families can access affordable formula.
”
Ranking Member Adrian Smith (R-NE) said
, “
The Formula Act makes infant formula more accessible and affordable by allowing it to be imported duty-free through the end of the year. Families should never have to experience the despair of worrying whether shelves will be stocked with the formula they need to feed their infants. As a father of two, including a one-year-old, nothing is more important than the health and well-being of children. I will continue to work with my colleagues to use trade tools to strengthen critical supply chains, like infant formula.
”
Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) said
, “
America’s mothers and fathers need help. This should never be a concern in our great nation, but young families are hunting from store to store to feed their infants. Red tape led to the culmination of the baby formula crisis, and removing it is our best way out. I’m so proud to say that Congress has drafted bipartisan legislation that temporarily waives trade tariffs, allows for the importation of safe baby formula, and increases formula options here at home. I look forward to President Biden signing this critical, bipartisan bill into law.
”
House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee member,
Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) said
, “
The baby formula crisis underscores the fragility of our supply chains when there is intense industry consolidation. Washington state in particular has felt the brunt of the formula shortage with parents facing empty shelves earlier and more acutely than other states. Parents should never struggle to feed their kids. This legislation will help alleviate this crisis by lowering the price of imported baby formula from safe and trusted partners abroad while our domestic production catches up.

Title: Sen. Lee Fights Biden’s War on Energy
Date: July 20, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) stood against high energy prices today in asking the Senate to pass his bill reaffirming the law to limit the President’s authority to delay or forgo legally required sales of energy leases on federal land.  Sen. Lee was joined in this effort by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK).  Utah is currently facing some of the highest gas prices in the nation with an average price over
five dollars a gallon.
President Biden and his administration have used court challenges, so-called reviews, and other tactics to delay or prevent legally required sales of oil and gas leases on federal land and in federally controlled waters.  This delay, along with other Biden Administration policies, has constrained the available domestic supply of energy and placed energy suppliers in Utah and elsewhere in difficult economic circumstances.
Sen. Lee said
of the bill, “
The American people cannot endure President Biden’s clear-as-mud policies any longer.  I’ve introduced legislation to reaffirm that under the Mineral Leasing Act, the President absolutely does not have the authority to hold the country’s domestic energy production hostage.
”
Sen. Lee continued
, “
We can end this crusade today and get to work securing American energy independence for generations to come.

Title: Sen. Lee Continues to Fight Inflation
Date: July 19, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
- Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sought passage of his Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act as a part of his continued effort to counter rising inflation.
Utah families are feeling the pains of inflation more acutely
than those from almost all other states.  This week’s Consumer Price Index grew beyond expectations placing inflation at a staggering 9.1% nationally.  Sen. Lee’s PRICE Act would require a three-fifths supermajority vote in the Senate to pass new spending measures when inflation is deemed to be above 3% nationally.  This bill constitutes a pillar of
Lee’s detailed plan to fight inflation
.  Government spending, especially deficit spending, is considered a major contributor to inflation.
Sen. Lee delivered floor remarks and asked that the Senate unanimously pass the PRICE Act.  While the proposal was objected to and accordingly did not pass, Sen. Lee committed to continue his efforts to pass the PRICE Act and to enact the other provisions of
his plan to fight inflation
.
Sen. Lee
said
of the bill, “
The PRICE Act is desperately needed. This insatiable spending machine is now costing Utahns 881 dollars a month more than they paid last year, and that’s on top of what they already pay in taxes.
”
Lee continued
, “
Congress has become the trust fund baby that doesn’t understand the value of a dollar. The PRICE act is the recognition that sometimes you need to take away the credit card.

Adrian Smith (R-NE) and a growing list of additional
cosponsors
.
Recently, the
US Senate unanimously passed
a modified version of the FORMULA Act introduced by Sen. Lee. The FORMULA Act was created to combat domestic baby formula shortages and bolster the supply chain to help American families feed their babies. Recent shortages come in the immediate aftermath of a recall and temporary closure of a major American formula factory, but highlight systemic weaknesses in this vital supply chain. Due to the disruption, families in Utah and across the nation are struggling to feed their babies. The FORMULA Act will lift substantial tariffs on the importation of baby formula and reduce the costs borne by retailers trying to keep their shelves stocked.
Following House passage of the Formula Act,
Sen. Mike Lee
said, “
With the highest birthrate in the nation, Utahns have particularly felt the weight of this prolonged baby formula crisis. I am thrilled to see the Formula Act pass the House with bipartisan support. We are one step closer to providing desperately needed relief to American newborns. For my part, I am committed to ensuring the bill once again passes the Senate and is signed into law.

“
While the 63 million lives lost to abortion since Roe can never be reclaimed, we can take heart that the Supreme Court has recognized that Roe v. Wade and its progeny belong next to Plessy v. Ferguson and Dred Scott v. Sandford in the anticanon of Supreme Court history. I have never been prouder to have clerked for Justice Alito or the Supreme Court of the United States.

I pray for national unity and for the safety of the justices of the Supreme Court who, in regard to this case, have faced unprecedented attacks. I thank God that the people of Utah and the United States are now free to enact protections for life and human dignity.

Title: Sen. Lee Applauds SCOTUS in Win for Religious Liberty
Date: June 21, 2022

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Last year, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and 11 of his Senate colleagues submitted an amicus brief supporting a challenge to a Maine statute that discriminated against the First Amendment rights of parents choosing to send their children to religious schools. In
Carson v. Makin
, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision striking down Maine’s discriminatory tuition assistance program. Authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court ruled in favor of religious liberty and parents’ right to choose the best education for their children.
Senator Lee said of the brief, “
Congress and the Supreme Court have long understood the value of both religious and secular education institutions. Students should not be punished for attending a school where faith is taught, and states should not be able to discriminate against citizens who choose to live and learn their faith in school.
”
The brief reads in part, “
Since its infancy under the Articles of Confederation, the United States of America has valued education and seen it as an integral part of a free society. To that end, Congress—entrusted with the will of the People—has worked for over two hundred years to increase educational opportunities for Americans.” and continues, “History shows that Congress repeatedly allocated funds to advance education without fear of triggering Establishment Clause concerns.

Eight amendments proposed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) became law under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act.  Three amendments were from his
SHIP IT Act
and represent a part of
his detailed plan to fight inflation
.  Senator Lee's contributions will be an essential step toward combatting our nation's supply chain crisis.  Lee’s amendments cut red tape responsible for delayed approval of much-needed port workers.  They require federal reporting to Congress, giving lawmakers a better understanding of how U.S. port technology stacks up against our competitors.  Additionally, they require the federal government to explore the feasibility of using U.S. Inland Ports, such as the one in Utah, for storing and transferring cargo containers.
Of his amendments,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The surge of online goods has exposed some problems, systemic problems, with our supply chain.  Americans in all states are experiencing consumer product shortages, and the end doesn’t appear to be anywhere in sight.  This has contributed to inflation that is costing American families.  I am encouraged that a number of my amendments that will help get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves have become law.

Sen. Lee continues to advocate for the passage of his complete SHIP IT Act to counter the supply chain and inflation crises.

Title: Lee’s Antitrust Venue Act Passes Senate
Date: June 16, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021 unanimously passed the Senate.  The bill would give state officials the same deference granted to federal antitrust enforcers in regard to the venue in which cases are heard.  When antitrust enforcement cases are brought in federal court by either federal or state enforcers, a number of private cases are often also brought against the defendant corporation.  These private cases often complicate the venue determination of an enforcement case and bring significant delays.  The State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act ensures that the States are afforded the same deference as the United Sates when selecting their venue to enforce the federal antitrust laws and removes the inefficiencies and barriers they confront under the current process.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
I am thrilled to see the bipartisan State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act unanimously pass the senate.  Putting state enforcers on equal footing with federal enforcers is an important step toward improving antitrust enforcement to better protect American consumers.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make further reforms to stop abusive monopolists.
”
The bill’s sponsor in the house,
Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), said
, “
The State A.G. Venue Act’s passage through the Senate marks the beginning of a new era of antitrust reform and proof-of-concept for a bipartisan reform coalition of conservatives and progressives.
”
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said,
“Effective antitrust enforcement is critical to ensuring consumers and businesses have the opportunity to compete. This bipartisan legislation will allow state attorneys general to more efficiently and effectively enforce antitrust laws, which will help protect consumers and strengthen competition.”

Date: June 9, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has delivered a letter to Ambassador María Pagán, the Deputy United States Trade Representative (USTR) to the World Trade Organization (WTO.) The letter urges Ambassador Pagán not to waive the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for COVID-19 vaccines. In her capacity as the USTR Ambassador to the WTO, she negotiates the terms of trade arrangements between the United States and WTO member nations.
Sen. Lee was joined in signing the letter by Senators Tom Tillis (R-NC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).
In part, the letter reads:
“
We are deeply concerned that waiving the protections for COVID-19 vaccines will discourage continued research, development, and distribution of medical innovations which may prove necessary to save American lives in the future. Intellectual property rights provide the grounds for businesses to take risks in turning novel ideas into concrete goods and services; that means fewer goods–not more–will be produced to combat pandemics if WTO-member countries stop enforcing IP protections. We urge you to consider the ramifications of waiving the TRIPS Agreement and ask you to defend the IP protections that have resulted in the majority of COVID-19 remedies that Americans—and millions of others around the globe—have utilized.”

Senator Mike Lee’s (R-UT) bill renaming the Provo Veterans Center after the late Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen was signed into law today by President Biden.  Col. Halvorsen is affectionately referred to as the ‘Candy Bomber’ for his unique and effective efforts distributing candy to the impoverished children of Berlin during the 1948 Berlin Airlift.  Halvorsen’s compassion, humanitarianism, and community service did not end in 1948.  He dedicated much of his life to serving children, promoting diplomacy between the United States and Germany, and regularly participated in community celebrations and re-enactments of the Candy Bombing of the Berlin Airlift.  While Halvorsen died in February of this year, his legacy continues through the Utah-based Gail S. Halvorsen Aviation Education Foundation.

“
Col. Gail Halvorsen represents the best of Utah and the best values of the Armed Forces.  In times of darkness and despair, Gail Halvorsen brought light and kindness, and his work and legacy continues to this day.  It is an honor to sponsor this bill and to rename the Provo Vet Center after a great Utahn.”

Senator Lee
said,
“Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the internet economy. It supports most of the free content and services Americans have come to rely upon, including essential local journalism, and it allows businesses of every size to reach their customers quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, online advertising is also suffering under the thumb of trillion-dollar tech companies.
“Companies like Google and Facebook have been able to exploit their unprecedented troves of detailed user data to obtain vice grip-like control over digital advertising, amassing power on every side of the market and using it to block competition and take advantage of their customers. The conflicts of interest are so glaring that one Google employee described Google’s ad business as being like ‘if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.’
“This lack of competition in digital advertising means that monopoly rents are being imposed upon every website that is ad-supported and every company—small, medium, or large—that relies on internet advertising to grow its business. It is essentially a tax on thousands of American businesses, and thus a tax on millions of American consumers.
“While online advertising is essential to nearly every business, this broken system has been the primary driver of growth for the tech companies that have failed us in so many other ways: by undermining our privacy, censoring our speech, and exploiting our children.
“That is why I have introduced this bill, and why I believe it is the first step towards liberating the internet—and therefore much of the 21
st
century economy—from the grip of Big Tech monopolists.”
Senator Cruz
said,
“Free markets require competition, and America has a long history of fighting monopolies in order to guarantee that healthy competition delivers the best results, products, and services for the American people. The internet should be no different. I’m proud to work in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues, Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, and Richard Blumenthal, to guarantee customer protections in digital advertising.”
Senator Klobuchar
said,
“For too long, Google and Facebook have dominated the digital advertising marketplace at the expense of advertisers, publishers, and consumers
.
It is past time for a transparent ad technology industry where the best interests of customers are prioritized and companies of all sizes are able to compete. This legislation will put rules in place to do just that, restoring and protecting competition in digital advertising to create a more even playing field that will promote fairness and innovation moving forward.”
Senator Blumenthal
said,
“Our bipartisan bill would guard against immense conflicts of interest in today’s digital advertising market. Big Tech claims that it simply presides over an open and free market, but in a truly free market the same party can’t represent the seller, the buyer, make the rules, and conduct the auction. And that is unacceptable in a free enterprise system – it hurts consumers and it hurts competition.”
Jon Schweppe, Policy Director at the American Principles Project said,
“
Republicans are increasingly recognizing the threat posed by Big Tech's concentrated corporate power. Senator Mike Lee in particular has been an important leader on the issue of antitrust enforcement. His Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act is well thought-out and addresses rampant anti-competitive behavior in the online ads market. American Principles Project is proud to endorse this bill, and we encourage Republicans to continue to embrace an all-of-the-above approach to reining in Big Tech.
”
“
The basic idea of this bill is simple: no one can serve two masters,
”
said Matt Stoller, Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project.
“
As the buyer, seller, broker, and exchange, Google maintains pervasive conflicts of interest in online advertising that it uses to manipulate markets. By breaking up Google’s third party ad tech business and requiring advertising intermediaries to disclose the prices and quality of the advertising they are buying and selling, this bill will finally allow honest price discovery in markets for online advertising.
”
“
No one would accept Goldman Sachs running the New York Stock Exchange, representing buyers of stock, and sellers of stock at the same time, just as no one would accept a lawyer representing both sides in a trial. Neither should Congress let corporations run all sides of a transaction in online ad markets,
”
Stoller continued.
Wade Miller, Executive Director at Citizens for Renewing America said,
“
The days of Big Tech getting away with gaming the digital advertising system are over. Senator Mike Lee's ‘Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act’ will end the market manipulation and anticompetitive practices of some of the biggest companies in tech. Sen. Lee has shown Congress how to break-up big tech the right way. We commend his efforts and urge Congress to stop talking and start legislating.
”
Charlotte Slaiman, Competition Policy Director at Public Knowledge, said
, “
The lack of competition in online advertising technology hurts not just advertisers and publishers but also consumers who pay more for products and see lower quality news and other content online. Right now, advertising is the primary business model for much of the internet. It’s essential that online advertising be an open ecosystem with dynamic and fair competition. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act takes a remarkable step towards that ideal by breaking up the largest ad tech giants and creating common-sense rules of the road. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act from Senators Lee and Klobuchar can address gatekeeper power in ad tech and make this market function better for consumers.
”
Mike Davis of the Internet Accountability Project said,
“
For many years now, monopolist control from Facebook and Google over the ad tech market has hurt small businesses, slowed innovation and stifled competition. Passing this bill into law would help put an end to the anticompetitive practices these Big Tech monopolists rely on for their undue trillions in market control. The Internet Accountability Project thanks Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz for their leadership and dedication to the free market and antitrust principles that are critical to restoring a fair and well functioning tech economy that encourages innovation and success.
”
Joel Thayer, President of the Digital Progress Institute, said,
“
Large tech platforms have operated under complete opacity, which has allowed them to engage in anticompetitive behavior within the digital ad market. Senator Lee’s Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act takes this issue head on by applying a meaningful and targeted framework that will not only help shed light on these practices that detrimentally harm competition in the digital ad space, but will also help open doors for smaller players by evening the odds. The Digital Progress Institute is proud to endorse this important piece of legislation.
”
Aiden Buzzetti, President of the Bull Moose Project, said,
“The Bull Moose Project enthusiastically supports the CDTA. This is a huge step in leveling the playing field of digital advertising. For too long we have seen companies dominate this field. Senator Lee should be commended for this legislation. We hope all Republicans will support this bill.”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stated
, “
We strongly support this legislation as a complement to our litigation efforts.  Both approaches are necessary to address Google's abuses and restore competition to the ad tech market.

Title: Lee’s UK Free Trade Resolution Passes Senate
Date: May 26, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee’s (R-UT) resolution calling for a free trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom passed the United States Senate.  Sen. Lee has advocated for a US-UK trade agreement since Britain’s vote to exit the European Union which allows for such a deal.  In negotiation with Democratic colleagues, Lee introduced various versions of the resolution over the course of the past three years.  He also published
an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal
with the Right Honourable Iain Duncan Smith MP calling for a free trade agreement between the allies.  In 2015, the United Kingdom was
Utah’s largest export market
, and in 2016 Utah exported over
$3.5 billion
in goods and services to the UK.
The resolution states in part, “
the United States should strengthen its close and mutually beneficial trading and economic partnership with the United Kingdom
,” and recognizes “
the United States and the United Kingdom share the world’s largest bilateral trade and investment relationship.
”
Of the Resolution,
Sen. Lee said,
“
The United States and the United Kingdom are the closest of allies and the most natural of economic partners.  Since the British people have reclaimed the right to negotiate their own trade agreements, I have advocated for a robust trade agreement between our nations.  I am overjoyed and encouraged to see the Senate pass this resolution calling for such a mutually beneficial agreement.  Free trade between our nations would be good for Britons, for Americans, and particularly for Utahns who have such close economic ties to our friends across the pond.

Title: Lee Amendments Push for American Energy
Date: May 25, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and other Republican members of the Senate Commerce Committee offered  over 70 amendments to a bill further regulating American energy companies.  While Lee introduced dozens of amendments, those that Lee offered for votes focused on reversing the Biden Administration’s moratorium on energy leases on federal land and countering a proposed SEC rule targeting energy producers with sweeping Environmental Social Governance (ESG) criteria obligations.  Gas prices in Utah and across the United States are currently at historic highs.  Democrats led by Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA) objected to the amendments.  Sen. Lee’s efforts to overturn Chair Cantwell’s rulings against the amendment were defeated on party-line, 14-14 votes.
In the hearing,
Sen. Lee said,
“
The reality remains that Democrats’ crusade against reliable, domestic energy sources has largely resulted in our current state of high energy prices. …
But instead of looking to address these negative “signals” and misguided regulatory policies that are sending our energy markets into a tailspin, the Administration as well as Senate and House Democrats are suggesting that the solution is to have more government micromanagement of our markets and that gas prices will come down if we just empower more federal bureaucrats to look over your shoulder.  In fact, House Democrats just passed legislation that unbelievably would give the federal government the power to enact what I can only call “price controls” on gasoline.

Title: Lee Leads Letter Questioning W.H.O. Abortion Guidelines
Date: May 20, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Representative Doug Lamborn (R-CO) led 53 other House and Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), urging a reversal on the Organization’s recent guidelines on abortion.  These guidelines advocate for abortion on demand and critique conscious objections of healthcare providers.  The updated guidelines follow years of controversy regarding the role, allegiance, and effectiveness of the W.H.O.
The letter reads in part, “
We, members of the U.S. Congress, write to you today with concerns about the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) dangerous new abortion guidelines. These extreme new guidelines aim to remove all legal and policy safeguards on abortion, impose restrictions on the conscience rights of health workers, and ignore the right to life and the safety of the mother and child.
…
“
Moreover, we are astonished that the W.H.O. is attempting to de-humanize preborn children and assert that the rights of the preborn do not exist by categorizing self-induced—and, in some cases, illegal—abortions as ‘self-care’ and demanding ‘the full decimalization of abortion’ without any gestational age limits. To categorize abortions as ‘self-care’ not only strips away the humanity and dignity of a preborn child but also contradicts international standards recognizing the preborn child as a rights-holding person.
…
“
Furthermore, this guidance not only threatens the conscience rights of health care providers at all levels but treats individuals and institutions that object to abortion as obstacles.
…
“
Given the W.H.O.’s influence, this guidance will likely cause severe, irreversible harm, not only to U.S. citizens but to women and children worldwide. Such overreach and trampling of national sovereignty also further delegitimizes the W.H.O. and U.N. in the eyes of many people around the world. For these reasons, we ask that the W.H.O. reverse course and retract the anti-life recommendations that it has promoted through the release of its 2022 abortion care guidelines.
”
Of the letter,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The World Health Organization’s new guidelines are radical anti-life propaganda that advocate for abortion until the moment of birth while deriding conscious objections that are a hallmark of free society.  Abortion is not healthcare, and the W.H.O. should cease being a mouthpiece for the left’s radical social engineering agenda.  The W.H.O. has done enough damage to its
reputation in recent years.  Our letter encourages the W.H.O. to change course and to stop using American taxpayer dollars to advocate against American interests and values globally.
”
Representative Lamborn
said,
“These new guidelines are alarming and completely disregard the sanctity of human life. Every instance of abortion is a tragedy and I hope that the World Health Organization seriously considers reversing these horrific guidelines. I will never waiver in my fight to protect the lives of the preborn, whether it be domestically or on the international stage. I thank Senator Lee for co-leading this extremely important letter and remaining strong in the fight to protect human life.”

Title: Lee Introduces Digital Advertising Act
Date: May 19, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), has introduced the
Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act
. The bill would restore and protect competition in digital advertising by eliminating conflicts of interest that have allowed the leading platforms in the market to manipulate ad auctions and impose monopoly rents on a broad swath of the American economy.
Senator Lee
said,
“Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the internet economy. It supports most of the free content and services Americans have come to rely upon, including essential local journalism, and it allows businesses of every size to reach their customers quickly and efficiently.

Title: Support for Lee’s FORMULA Act
Date: May 18, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Since introducing the Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) has received wide support from congressional colleagues and outside groups. The FORMULA Act is aimed at combating domestic baby formula shortages and bolstering the supply chain to help American families feed their babies.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT)
“Over 40% of Montana’s baby formula supply is out of stock, and Montana moms and dads are struggling to feed their babies because of it. This is a crisis for families in Montana, and we must prioritize the needs of these parents and children. It is critical that we combat this formula shortage and bolster the supply chain in order to get formula back on the shelves immediately.”
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA):
“Iowa is one of several states where half of all baby formula was sold out at the end of April, and I’ve heard from parents and health care providers rightfully concerned about the health and welfare of babies and patients with special medical needs. It’s critically important that a reliable supply of formula is reestablished immediately. The FORMULA Act will accomplish this by removing trade and regulatory barriers to ensure infants and patients receive the nutrition they need to survive.”
Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS):
“Parents are struggling to feed their newborns because baby formula has disappeared from the shelves,”
Wicker said.
“Congress needs to act quickly to address this problem. I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that would provide relief and allow more product to reach the market.”
Sen. Bill Cassidy M.D. (R-LA):
“No mom should have to fear whether or not she will have enough formula for her child,”
said Dr. Cassidy
. “The Biden administration knew the shortage was coming, but they did nothing. Once more, they have mismanaged an impending crisis.”
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“American babies are going hungry and the federal government is standing in the way. Current policies, tariffs, quotas, bans, and regulations are preventing mothers and fathers from being able to make the best choices to feed their babies. My FORMULA Act will give these families relief during this unprecedented shortage. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately to protect American babies from going hungry.”
Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT)
, the bill’s sponsor in the House of Representatives:
“New mothers are hunting from store to store to feed their infants,”
said Rep. Stewart.
“This is heartbreaking to see, and it should never happen in America. Red tape led to the culmination of this crisis, and removing it is our best way out. My legislation will temporarily waive trade tariffs, allow for the importation of safe baby formula, and increase formula options here at home. To my congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle: America’s mothers and fathers need help, and there is no time to waste. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately.”
Hadley Heath Manning, Director of Policy at Independent Women’s Voice
,
said in a letter
,
“Independent Women’s Voice, which fights to enhance people’s freedom, opportunities and well-being, supports the Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act, introduced by Senator Mike Lee. … [W]e cannot sit idly by while parents grow even more helpless to feed their babies. We thank Senator Lee for his leadership on this important issue and urge all Senators and Members of Congress to support this proposed legislation if it comes to the floor for a vote.”
Jessica Anderson, Executive Director of Heritage Action,
said,
“Big government is once again creating a crisis in President Biden’s America. Thanks to a heavy handed FDA, the United States faces a baby-formula shortage, forcing American moms and dads to scramble in order to feed their children. Fortunately, Senator Lee has recognized that the best way to help parents is to get the government out of the way. The FORMULA Act, which the Senator introduced this week, will do just that by suspending burdensome regulations that are currently preventing parents from getting their children the nourishment they need.”
The FORMULA Act targets supply chain disruption by temporarily waiving current protectionist trade barriers like tariffs and quotas on importation that reduce the supply and increase the price of available foreign-made formula. The bill would also waive regulations that prevent the importation of safe baby formula from abroad. This would allow American families to access safe and plentiful formula manufactured in Europe and elsewhere during the current shortage. The bill will also allow Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program recipients to use vouchers to purchase formula from any producer rather than be limited to the brand or product listed on specific vouchers—which may be unavailable.

Title: Lee Offers Amendment to Target and Pay For Ukraine Aid
Date: May 16, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) has introduced an amendment to the House-passed, $40 billion Ukraine Aid package to streamline and target aid to meet the needs on the ground in the conflict.  Sen. Lee’s amendment also would pay for the expenditure ensuring the aid does not add to the national deficit.
Of the amendment,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The House proposal would spend nearly ten times the annual defense budget of Ukraine while delegating broad discretion to the President and bureaucrats regarding where and how most of the money is spent.  Much of the money will likely go to nations across the world not involved in the conflict.
”
Lee continued,
“Putin’s aggression is indefensible, and we should look for appropriate ways to support Ukrainians in the noble defense of their homeland. We must also make sure Congress maintains its constitutional role of directing engagement in conflict and ensure that we are not spending unnecessary funds while in a time of historic inflation and ballooning national debt.  My amendment will ensure we can help our friends without compromising our constitutional or financial integrity.”

Title: Sen. Lee's FORMULA Act
Date: May 16, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is finalizing his Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act to combat domestic baby formula shortages and bolster the supply chain to help American families feed their babies. In recent days, challenges in the baby formula supply chains have seen the out-of-stock rate for formula to triple from numbers seen six months ago. Recent shortages come in the immediate aftermath of a recall and temporary closure of a major American formula factory, but highlight systemic weaknesses in this vital supply chain. Due to the disruption, families in Utah and across the nation are struggling to feed their babies.
The FORMULA Act targets supply chain disruption by temporarily waiving current protectionist trade barriers like tariffs and quotas on importation that reduce the supply and increase the price of available foreign-made formula. The bill would also waive regulations that prevent the importation of safe baby formula from abroad.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Regulatory Reform Bills to Spur Economy
Date: May 12, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the PIONEER Act today to create a federal regulatory sandbox reducing the heavy burden of federal regulations and allowing businesses to grow, develop, and innovate with an expanded degree of flexibility.  The PIONEER Act joins Sen. Lee’s LIBERATE Act as proposals to reduce burdensome regulations on businesses to spur growth and bolster the struggling economy.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute has estimated that federal regulations and intervention cost American consumers and businesses $1.9 trillion each year. Just within federal infrastructure projects alone it is estimated that federal regulations increase a project’s cost by as much as 20%.
The LIBERATE Act, introduced in April, would create a “Regulatory Oversight and Review Task Force” that would submit reports to Congress that would include a list of regulations recommended for repeal.  All or part of the recommended repeals would be eligible for expedited procedures in both the House and the Senate.  The PIONEER Act follows Utah’s state regulatory sandbox law which has allowed businesses to expand, hire, and develop while cooperating with government to develop more efficient and effective regulatory regimes in the state.
Of the bills,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The federal government is notorious for instituting burdensome regulations that increase costs, inhibit innovation, and rarely expire. Sadly, many of these regulations have resulted from Congress’s long history of ceding legislative authority to bureaucrats. My LIBERATE Act would require a task force to examine existing burdensome federal regulations, compile them into a list, and transmit them to Congress where lawmakers would be able to vote on their immediate repeal. Second, my PIONEER Act would create the first federal regulatory sandbox program which would waive regulations that are currently impeding the start or expansion of their business for periods of two years while adhering to certain consumer health and safety protections. These bills, combined with my REINS Act, will provide the needed regulatory reform toolbox that can tackle the massive federal regulatory burden allowing our business environment to thrive.
”
Sen. Lee’s regulatory reform efforts are supported by Americans for Prosperity, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, FreedomWorks, the Libertas Institute, and the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce.  Quotes are below.
“A mountain of needless regulations is crushing Americans by stifling the supply of energy, food, and other household goods. In contrast, smart regulatory reform will create an economy that works for everyone.  Senator Lee’s LIBERATE Act would deliver relief to Americans through a systematic, across-the-board reduction of existing rules that are not achieving their intended goals. The U.S. badly needs to put an end to overregulation that suppresses opportunity and limits innovation. Senator Lee’s plan is a visionary and bold step in the right direction.”
Americans for Prosperity
“In Washington, D.C., rules and regulations are even less disciplined than federal spending is; and as we all know, that "budgeted" federal spending has plunged the nation into a $30 trillion abyss. The often ignored "hidden tax" of regulatory intervention must be brought to heel alongside spending, especially since President Biden has launched a series of self-proclaimed "Whole-of-Government" regulatory campaigns. Restoration is urgent, and must be rooted in disclosure, but most importantly in a full-throated re-establishment of Article I Congressional accountability that ends regulation without representation once and for all. Necessary steps include implementing a regulatory reduction commission like that presented in Senator Mike Lee's LIBERATE Act, as well as requiring a shirking Congress to reassume its authority over lawmaking by affirming significant new agency rules and guidance documents before they bind anyone.”
Competitive Enterprise Institute
National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support Senator Lee's LIBERATE Act, which would help roll back excessive regulations and foster more economic growth. American businesses should not be burdened by outdated, unnecessary regulations as they strive to innovate, create jobs, and succeed in a difficult economy. NTU appreciates Senator Lee's efforts and looks forward to working with him to pass the LIBERATE Act. –
Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union
"Today's economy is burdened by outdated bureaucratic regulations that limit or outlaw innovative new approaches to solving our problems and needs. Following the lead of his home state's legislature, Senator Lee's PIONEER Act provides a hopeful and bipartisan solution: a flexible approach to regulations that welcomes new ideas and approaches to make our world better."
Connor Boyack, President of Libertas Institute
“One of the most important and intentional ways Utah has developed the strongest economy in the nation has been our relentless efforts to weed out unreasonable and overbearing government regulation that limits commerce, increases prices, hurts small business, and serves no public purpose.  The federal government would do well to follow Utah’s lead in regulatory reform, and that is exactly what Senator Mike Lee has proposed with his recent introduction of the LIBERATE Act and the PIONEER Act. These bills will combat regulatory red tape, foster innovation, and create jobs. Such principles will allow Utah to continue to thrive as the most business friendly state in the nation.”

Title: Sen. Lee Celebrates House Passage of RECA
Date: May 12, 2022

Content:
The House of Representatives has passed Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) two-year extension of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) ensuring that those Americans harmed by the nation’s early nuclear program can be compensated. Rep. Burgess Owens (UT-04)
championed
the RECA in the House. The United States Senate unanimously
passed
the Lee measure in April.
Following House passage,
Sen. Lee
said,
“When the government harms people, victims should be able to receive compensation. Downwinders and others harmed by the nation’s early atomic program often suffer the consequences of exposure decades after the fact. The passage of my RECA extension is a statement saying the United States government is not abandoning these victims and communities.”
In 1990, RECA became law, providing a one-time cash benefit to certain persons who participated in atomic weapons testing or lived near nuclear test sites during periods of above-ground atomic weapons testing between 1951 and 1992.  To date, RECA has awarded over $2.4 billion in benefits to more than 38,000 claimants in Nevada, Utah, and elsewhere. It was previously scheduled to sunset in July of this year.  This bill pushes the expiration to 2024.
Sen. Lee has long advocated that Americans within geographic areas that have been found to be affected by atomic weapons testing should be eligible for compensation.  This extension comes as a part of legislative negotiation on his more comprehensive
Downwinders Act
which would expand eligibility for compensation to new geographic areas and extend application eligibility by another ten years.

Downwinders, uranium miners, uranium millers, and ore transporters were harmed by the federal government and deserve compensation.  I am encouraged that my colleagues agreed with this important extension and passed the bill unanimously.

Title: Sen. Lee Questions Pentagon About Covid Vaccine Military Discharges
Date: April 28, 2022

Content:
Washington, D.C.
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), who has long opposed federal Covid-19 vaccine mandates, sent a letter with Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) and other senators asking Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to provide information on the number and nature of military discharges for not receiving a Covid vaccine.  Reports show that more than 1,700 servicemembers have been discharged for their Covid vaccination status and many are being denied retirement or other service benefits as a result.
The letter reads in part, “
While we are deeply troubled that the Department of Defense (DOD) is discharging U.S. military personnel as a result of their COVID-19 vaccination status,
we are outraged that these brave men and women are potentially being stripped of various benefits, including education benefits afforded to them under the G.I. Bill. Whatever disagreements public officials of varying ideologies and political parties may have, we can and should agree on the importance of ensuring the promises made to members of our Armed Forces are fulfilled.

Title: Sen. Lee’s Detailed Plan to Fight Inflation
Date: April 14, 2022

Content:
Salt Lake City
– Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) was joined by Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) in Utah this week as they discussed the nation’s energy needs and rising inflation costs on American families.  The senators met with energy industry leaders, discussed the issues with local elected officials, and met with Utah families at a gas station in Bountiful about the impact of the President’s energy policies and inflation.Sen. Lee, through his role as ranking member of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, released a
state inflation tracker
that provides the most detailed information available on how inflation is impacting the various states and families who live therein.  The data show that inflation is hitting Utah harder than almost anywhere else in the nation.  While inflation nationally is at 9.9%, in Utah the rate is 11.9%.  The data show that the average Utah family is paying an additional $702 a month and $8,429 a year due to this inflation.
Sen. Lee has introduced a number of bills to fight inflation in Utah from its various sources, reckless federal spending, supply-chain difficulties, and skyrocketing housing costs.
Spending: The PRICE Act

Sen. Lee introduced the Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act on March 3, 2022.  The PRICE Act requires a 3/5 majority of Senators to approve new spending measures when the nation’s inflation rate is at or above 3%.  Runaway federal spending has been a major contributor to current inflation, which is now charted as the highest rate in four decades.  This bill builds upon Senator Lee’s budget amendment that received 49 votes during the August 2021 budget reconciliation process.

Supply-Chain: The SHIP IT Act
Sen. Lee introduced the SHIP IT Act on March 10, 2022 to help ease the nations supply chain crisis and counter rising inflation by simplifying or suspending certain federal regulations on ports, ships, and trucks.  Empty shelves and backlogged ports have wreaked havoc on American businesses and families.  This bill focuses on streamlining the process to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves.  The SHIP IT Act builds on and expands Sen. Lee’s STOP the GRINCH Act which was introduced in 2021.

Housing: The HOUSES Act
Sen. Lee introduced his Helping Open Underutilized Space to Ensure Shelter or HOUSES Act on April 7, 2022 to help units of local government address housing supply and affordability in their jurisdictions.  The federal government owns more than two-thirds of the land in Utah.  Utah is also among the states with the most competitive housing markets and limited housing supply.  That constrained supply led home prices in the state to increase by 24.5% from 2020 to 2021. Coupled with historic inflation, the rising prices of housing is making life less affordable for western families.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Increase Utah Housing Supply
Date: April 8, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced his Helping Open Underutilized Space to Ensure Shelter or HOUSES Act to help units of local government address housing supply and affordability in their jurisdictions.  The federal government owns more than two-thirds of the land in Utah.  Utah is also among the states with the most competitive housing markets and limited housing supply.  That constrained supply led home prices in the state to increase by 24.5% from 2020 to 2021. Coupled with historic inflation, the rising prices of housing is making life less affordable for western families.
The HOUSES Act helps solve Utah’s land and housing scarcity by allowing parcels of federal land to be purchased by a state or unit of local government at a reduced price giving them flexibility to address housing constraints.  The act requires that land be used for housing, subject to a density requirement, and protects against development of expensive second homes on the purchased parcels.
Of the bill
Sen. Lee said,
“
Supply is not meeting housing demand in Utah, and the federal government’s land ownership is a significant cause of our restricted housing stock.  The HOUSES Act will free federal land in a responsible manner to keep the dream and promise of Utah alive.  This bill will help ensure Utah remains a place where families and communities can thrive, grow, and prosper.
”
Sen. John Barasso (R-WY) said
of the bill, “
Wyoming and the West are blessed with tremendous resources, including vast expanses of land. As more and more people move to places like Wyoming, the growing communities need options to expand housing for residents. The HOUSES Act will give many new options to state and local governments by allowing them to buy certain lands from the federal government for residential purposes. This has already been happening in Nevada.  It makes sense for other public lands states to have the same opportunities.
”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said,
“
As our state has experienced rapid growth over the last decade, housing prices have skyrocketed and housing affordability has become a growing challenge for communities across our state—a challenge which has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. We must make finding and affording houses more accessible for everyone. However, with two-thirds of our state owned by the federal government, the ability of many communities to expand is prohibited by federal ownership. By increasing the amount of federal land that can be used for housing development—ranging from single family homes to low-income housing and apartments—our legislation will start to address our state’s housing shortages.
”
Utah County Commissioner,
Amelia Powers Gardner said,
“
Utah County is facing a critical affordable housing shortage that is going to require creative and innovative solutions to solve. Senator Mike Lee’s HOUSES Act is one solution that could actually move the needle in helping to ensure more affordable housing in Utah County. Senator Lee’s HOUSES Act is one example of creative and innovative solutions for tackling our affordable housing shortage in Utah County. The HOUSES Act would give local government one more tool that could help combat the lack of affordable housing in Utah County.
”
President and CEO of the Cedar City Chamber of Commerce,
Christopher M. McCormick said,
“
The HOUSES Act would have a significant impact on the affordable housing crisis[.] … The Cedar City Chamber of Commerce stands in support of the HOUSES Act and urges our legislators to implement this as expeditiously as possible.  This is not only a good plan for Utah, but the nation as a whole, as this is becoming a nationwide problem.
”
Washington City Councilman,
Kurt Ivie said of the bill,
“
The median home price in Washington County hit $553,000 in February of 2022. Housing is quickly becoming unaffordable and unattainable for many of our residents. We need to find solutions that will allow the middle class to thrive in Washington City. I appreciate Senator Lee including me in this critical discussion and for bringing forward the HOUSES Act, a bill that will give municipalities another avenue through which they can increase the supply of more affordable housing. I support this concept as one way to alleviate pressure on the housing market. I look forward to working with Senator Lee and the communities across Utah to build support for this bill. This is a great issue backed by an absolute need and Senator Lee’s bill is good policy.
”
Vernal Area Chamber of Commerce Legislative Committee Chairman,
Steve Evans said,
“
Like the rest of the State of Utah, Uintah County has a severe shortage of affordable housing.  Much of the area in Uintah County is under BLM jurisdiction and many of these large tracts of land are not usable for recreation or other public uses.  If this act is passed, it would allow counties like Uintah County to provide opportunities for affordable housing to be built.  We very much support Senator Lee’s efforts to pass the HOUSES Act.
”
The National Association of Counties also supports the bill.
Sen. Lee is joined by Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) as cosponsors.

Title: Sen. Lee Leads 68 Colleagues in Letter Demanding DOJ Investigate Deaths of Washington D.C. Preborn Babies
Date: April 8, 2022

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter signed by 23 senators and 46 representatives to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding the Department of Justice investigate the deaths of preborn babies whose remains have been found in Washington D.C.  Images have been widely circulated of the remains that suggest some of the babies may have undergone unlawful partial-birth abortions or possibly infanticide at the Washington Surgi-Clinic.  Yet, the Metropolitan Police Department of D.C. has made the assumption that each preborn baby died as the result of a legal abortion.
In the letter, the
members of Congress say
in part, “
We are gravely concerned by allegations brought forward that suggest a preborn baby underwent a partial birth abortion at the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, D.C.  We demand that you conduct a comprehensive investigation on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of each preborn baby.
“Alongside passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, Congress declared that ‘a moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion … is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.
…
“We formally request that you direct the appropriate personnel at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate whether these preborn babies were aborted in violation of federal law.”
Of the effort
Sen. Lee said,
“
Partial-birth abortion is a tragedy and a crime of the most gruesome nature.  While local authorities bend to political pressure to protect abortion facilities from investigation, this bicameral group of sixty-nine members of Congress is committed to make sure the evidence is fully investigated and that any crimes are prosecuted.  I am proud to lead this group in demanding justice be done.

Title: Commerce Committee Passes Multiple Lee Amendments
Date: March 25, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
offered 54 amendments to the eleven bills considered in a
Senate Commerce Committee markup
this week.  The committee considered bills ranging from the future of 6G technology to incentivizing biological protection programs.  Fourteen of Sen. Lee’s amendments were incorporated into the bills passed by the committee.
Many of the adopted amendments include key provisions of Sen. Lee’s
SHIP IT Act
, which he introduced in March of this year.  These provisions include authorizing the Coast Guard to expedite certain documents required to work at major ports, provisions supporting the usage of inland port infrastructure, and a report that details the technological competitiveness of U.S. ports compared with those of peer nations.  One Lee amendment to free certain federal lands for the temporary storage of containers during our nation’s current supply chain difficulties was defeated on a party-line vote.
Of his amendments,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The surge of online goods has exposed some problems, systemic problems, with our supply chain.  Americans in all states are experiencing consumer product shortages, and the end doesn’t appear to be anywhere in sight.  This has contributed to inflation that is costing American families.  I am encouraged that the Commerce Committee has adopted many of my amendments that will help get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves.

Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
led a bicameral letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken advocating that the State Department assist Ukrainian refugees and aid American families who have already begun the process of adopting Ukrainian orphans. The letter asks the Department of State to aid the Ukrainian government to establish a consular office in Poland to process paperwork required for adoption.  The letter further asks about current State Department efforts to aid Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees.
The letter reads in part, “
We write to thank you for the work of the United States Department of State to assist the people of Ukraine during this crisis and to make you aware of a particular group of orphans amongst the many fleeing the country.  There are families already towards the very end of the process to adopt Ukrainian orphans, and they are waiting for approval from the Ukrainian government to be united with their adopted children on U.S. soil.
”
The members continue, “
We believe the State Department can do more to urge or aid the Ukrainian application process to continue, especially for cases close to finalization. … Helping these orphans to join their American families expeditiously will allow them to get to a safe, nurturing environment while freeing up resources for other refugees.  In a warzone and a refugee crisis, it is often the most vulnerable who bear the greatest consequences.
”
Including Sen. Lee, the letter is signed by thirty-nine members of Congress.

Title: Day 2: Senator Lee Questions SCOTUS Nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson
Date: March 23, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States today on the second day of questioning.  His questions focused on her past cases dealing with federal lands, her record on criminal sentencing, and the troubling history of Supreme Court precedent regarding partial-birth abortion.  A full transcript of the exchange is below.
MSL indicates Sen. Lee is speaking.  JKBJ and italics indicate Judge Jackson is speaking.  Timestamps are in reference to the above-linked video.
[00:00:00]
MSL:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge. I want to talk next a little bit about a case that you were involved in. A case called
Coal River Mountain Watch versus the United States Department of the Interior
. It was a ruling that you issued in 2015 while on the Federal District Court.  I know you've had a lot of cases.
JKBJ:
I have.
I can't imagine that by merely triggering the case name that would necessarily bring it back. But this case involved [00:00:30] a challenge to an administrative action within the Department of Interior on some issues bearing on coal mining within the state of West Virginia.
There were two parallel challenges brought against that administrative action; one in a federal district court in West Virginia, where the land in question was located and another in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, where you sat. The government defending itself against that action brought by [00:01:00] some environmental groups, asked that you dismiss the DC case so that the matter could be litigated in West Virginia. You denied that.
Can you, based on my description of the facts, does that ring any bells? And can you tell me why you might've denied it?
[00:01:17]
JKBJ:
Thank you, Senator. It actually doesn't. It sounds like dozens of cases that I handled with similar issues and requests. Something like a motion to
[00:01:30]
dismiss is early in the action. And so denying a motion to dismiss is pretty routine for the District of Columbia.
[00:01:36]
MSL:
I understand it. And I'm sure you handled a lot of those all the time as a district judge. The reason I raise it is just because it relates indirectly to some concerns that I've got that are somewhat unique to the Western United States.
We have a lot of cases that involve the U S Department of the Interior and agency actions taken relative to the public land [00:02:00] that we have. In every state east of Colorado the federal government owns less than 15% of the land. And in most of those it's much less than 15%, in the single digits or low single digits. In every state, Colorado and west of Colorado, the federal government owns more than 15% of the land, and most of the time it's a lot more.
In my state it happens to be about two thirds of the land that's owned by the federal government. As a result it complicates our ability to do just about everything we do, whether it's recreation, construction, oil, and gas development, whether it's [00:02:30] just accessing people's farms and ranches, or even something as simple as trying to fund local fire, police, search and rescue operations. All these things are affected by the excessive ownership of federal land by the federal government and the way it's often managed.
Sometimes decisions made at the federal level are challenged in parallel actions like these: one in the forum state, in the host state to where the action is happening and other in DC. And I'm always [00:03:00] concerned about forum shopping, and I'm sure that's something you've watched out for as a judge and saw forum shopping from time to time. It's also something that touches on an issue that involves statutory interpretation. There’s something called the Antiquities Act passed 110 years ago or so, designed to give presidents of the United States the authority to designate parcels of federal land as national monuments.[00:03:30]
This text of the statute states that the limits of the parcels in question should be quote, “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care, and management of the objects to be protected”. Now given that these presidential proclamations tend to be broad, it's sometimes the objects to be protected are also broad.
And as a result of that it's difficult to tell what the [00:04:00] limits are. Do you have any reactions to how we could discern that? How we could define any meaning out of that? It's got to mean something, the text of the statute. You try not to leave language simply unaddressed or meaningless in a statute.
Do you have any thoughts on how a statute like that, saying that it should be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected? Any thoughts briefly on that?
[00:04:24]
JKBJ:
Well Senator, if I were presented with a case with that
[00:04:30]
statute in that circumstance, I would proceed as I always have.
You would have to understand the party’s arguments about the particulars in the case. What does the presidential proclamation say? To what does it relate? Whether there are any precedents in this area that define, further define, or further address what Congress intended with respect to the statute at issue.
[00:04:59]
MSL:
And I would assume that it would also matter if the government's lawyer defending the president's action made an argument that would leave the interpretation open-ended and meaningless.
[00:05:11]
JKBJ:
Well, as part of your interpretive exercise, as you're considering the party’s various arguments, one that did not account for all the words in a statute would be one that you might not agree with.
[00:05:28]
MSL:
No, I [00:05:30] get it. And this is one of the things that I've appreciated about what you've told us in these hearings. I really like the way you've described the effect. It's important to construe the text that you're asked to interpret. And in interpreting that you look at the language and you're endeavoring to figure out the original public meaning.
And I think that is a very helpful thing. Let’s move to a different issue a moment ago. Now, you clerked on the U S [00:06:00] Supreme Court for Justice Breyer in October term 1999, is that right?
JKBJ:
That is right.
MSL:
You clerked for Justice Breyer. And that was the same year that the Supreme court issued its decision in a case called
Stenberg vs. Carhart
. This is the case where the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a Nebraska law prohibiting partial birth abortion. In the absence of circumstances where the baby posed a threat to the life of a mother.[00:06:30] Now to be clear that the law prohibited a procedure where the abortionist causes an unborn baby to be partially delivered by the mother.
And then the abortionist intentionally kills the baby outside the womb by puncturing its skull with scissors and then collapsing the skull. This is gruesome and I don't like having to quote this, but it is relevant to the topic we're covering here. Justice Kennedy described it this way and chilling terms in [00:07:00] his dissent when he describes the fact that, “When scissors are inserted into the back of the head, the fetus’ body wholly outside the woman's body and alive reacts as though startled and then goes limp.”
Justice Scalia in his great eloquence expressed, lamented the ruling, but also expressed optimism for the fact that future courts would get it right. Saying quote, “I'm optimistic enough to believe that one day
Stenberg versus Carhart
will be assigned to its rightful place in the history of this [00:07:30] court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. This method of killing a human child, one cannot even accurately say an entirely unborn human child, prescribed by the statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shutter of revulsion.”
We then saw a few years later, the Supreme Court of the United States issue a different ruling. The Supreme Court issued a different ruling in a case called [00:08:00]
Gonzales v. Carhart
.
Gonzales v. Carhart
upheld a different statute. This one was federal rather than state, but it was a different federal statute that also prohibited partial birth abortion.
Judge Jackson, can you distinguish these cases for me? What was the difference between
Gonzales v. Carhartt
, where the partial birth abortion ban in question was upheld whereas in
Stenberg v. Carhartt
, it was invalidated? [00:08:30]
[00:08:31]
JKBJ:
Thank you Senator. I don't have the opinions in front of me. I think it had to do with the method of extraction, the fact-finding related to the procedure.
In one case the district court had made some findings in, and the court felt bound by them. And in another there was considerations beyond those that
[00:09:00]
previously relied upon. So there were distinctions that the court looked at and considered in the cases.
[00:09:09]
MSL:
Let's talk about court packing for a minute.
JKBJ:
Yes.
MSL:
One of the reasons court packing concerns me. One of the many reasons is because it's not prohibited in the first instance, it's not prohibited by the constitution. There's nothing in the constitution that says that Congress may not change the size of the Supreme Court, there's no limitation on that. [00:09:30] We have for one hundred and fifty years stuck with the number nine.
It has worked, and the absence of an argument saying that that number is too low, the court is too small, from a workforce standpoint we need to expand it. It's difficult to imagine why it would be a good idea to change it, particularly, because if you increase the size of the court in one fell swoop, and you do that for partisan political purposes, [00:10:00] allowing one president, the current president, to have a disproportionate impact on the court.
And to change its rulings, that portion of the court's docket that tends to be more politically contentious. It can turn the court into a political football of sorts. Given the fact that our Supreme Court Justices serve for life, once you do that, it becomes something of a one-way ratchet, always expanding, never contracting.
Before long, you could [00:10:30] see an increasingly larger court with the court expanding each time a different party secures the coveted circumstance of a majority of the House, majority in the Senate, and controlled by the same party of the White House. And so this is why it concerns me. I understand why it is that the canons of judicial ethics don't allow you to comment on matters that might come before you.
This is one that could not come before you as a justice. This is not a justiciable political question. It's [00:11:00] committed to the two political branches of government. There's not even a constitutional challenge that could lie to it, even though it would undermine the separation of powers in the constitution.
As I see it, it's not unconstitutional. So it couldn't, and it would never come before you. Last night when you were asked a question by my colleague Senator Kennedy  on this, you acknowledged that you have an opinion? Did I understand that right? Do you have an opinion on court packing?
[00:11:25]
JKBJ:
Senator, I have a lot of opinions. I'm a
[00:11:30]
human being, and I have an opinion on a lot of things. The reason why, in my view, it is not appropriate for me to comment is because of my fidelity to the judicial role. I understand that it's a political question, and that is precisely why I think that I am uncomfortable speaking to it.
[00:11:54]
MSL:
I understand that and out of respect, I respect the impulse. I respect[00:12:00] the overall issue. And I think it's better for Article III judges and justices ordinarily to not wade into the political thicket. This one I do think is different because number one, as I said, can never come before you.
Number two: It does have an impact on what you would be doing. And you also as an Article III judge, someone who's served for nearly nine years as a Federal Judge, you've developed experience and intuition, and a thorough understanding of our federal court system. And that's why I think your [00:12:30] perspective on it would be valuable.
The reason it concerns me so much is that even when court packing doesn't succeed legislatively, it can leave an impact. The last time this was attempted was in 1937. President Franklin D Roosevelt was upset at the Supreme Court on a number of basis. He didn't like the 32 year old precedent of
Lochner versus New York
. Where five conservatives on the Supreme Court engaged in an act of judicial activism, reading [00:13:00] something into the constitution that wasn't really there.
Some people disagree with me on this, but it wasn’t there, and they impose that. But the bigger reason was, he didn't like the court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. It was that interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The one we discussed yesterday, you know, prior to 1937, you had the Supreme Court agreeing as far as the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce that we talked about yesterday. You had the court more or less in agreement over [00:13:30] time as to the impact of the Dormant Commerce Clause.
But as to the substantial effects test that didn't exist yet. It required something much closer to an interstate commercial transaction. In order for Congress's Commerce Clause authority to kick in, they were the so-called four horsemen of the apocalypse. FDR actually called them, four conservatives who were consistently pushing for limits on congress’s authority.
And then you had other [00:14:00] justices who would sometimes join with them. Usually that included Justice Owen Roberts, who stood with them in maintaining narrower authority for Congress under the Commerce Clause. All that changed went on April 12th, 1937. Two weeks to the day when the case often associated with the so-called switching time that changed nine,
West Coast Hotel versus Parish
, or where they undid the Lochner precedent.
April 12th, 1937, the Supreme court decided a case
LRP vs
[00:14:30]
Jones and Laughlin Steel
that forever changed and magnified, expanded the Commerce Clause in a way that had it been through a constitutional amendment, it would be among the most significant, impactful constitutional amendments ever adopted.
And yet it's rarely discussed. This case resulted from one vote, one person on the Supreme Court who changed his vote; associate Justice Owen Roberts. It's widely believed, and I believe it, based on what I've researched on it, he was influenced heavily by FTR’s court [00:15:00] packing plan. He didn't want to be on a court that was packed.
He convinced himself that he made that switch in order to save the court as it was. And that has changed everything. It's led to a much bigger, more expensive, more intrusive federal government. We can disagree as to the policy merits of that, but it did change the constitution. That's why I worry about that.
So I hope. I understand you don't want to answer it. I hope that between now and [00:15:30] the end of the day, you'll see fit to tell us what your opinion is. I do think it's worth discussing.
Let's talk for a minute, just got a moment left. I want to get back to your sentencing approach.
Now, when you approach these child pornography cases, what you're describing, in many circumstances is an overall concern that you've got what the [00:16:00] sentencing guidelines and particularly that portion of the sentencing guidelines that deals with child pornography cases. This showed up in the transcripts of some of your sentencing hearings, including the transcript of your sentencing hearing in the Hawkins case. I turned to that page 38, line 17 to 24 of that transcript.
Here's something you say in that Hawkins case, and I believe this was the eighteen year old defendant that you sentenced to three months in prison, when the lower end [00:16:30] of the guidelines range would have been ninety-seven. I think the higher end would have been in the one-twenties or something like that.
You said, and in your case, this is you speaking to Mr. Hawkins. In your case in particular, “I don't feel that it is appropriate necessarily to increase the penalty on the basis of your use of a computer, or the number of images, or prepubescent victims. As the guidelines require because these circumstances exist in many cases, if not most, [00:17:00] and don't signal, an especially heinous or egregious child pornography offense.”
I've got a couple of questions about that. Were those, you start off that paragraph sounding like you're making a determination as to him, but then the observations you make in that paragraph seem to apply broadly. Is that right?
[00:17:22]
JKBJ:
Senator, I do not have the transcript of Mr. Hawkins case. I recall that I
[00:17:30]
found that case, like all child pornography cases, to be difficult, really difficult. His case, I recall, was in many ways an outlier, in terms of the various considerations that Congress required me to take into account.
[00:17:51]
MSL:
But there were prepubescent victims that were at stake?
[00:17:54]
JKBJ:
I don't remember how many, I don't remember the circumstances of his actual crime. What I will say is that, consistent with Supreme Court case law and Congress's statute in this area, judges have to take into account a number of factors, and the guidelines, which are no longer, I won't say not mandatory you have to calculate the guidelines, there are no longer binding and the Supreme Court has said that under the statutory scheme to judges have discretion.
[00:18:32]
MSL:
Okay, I am also almost out of time and I want to make a point. Hawkins, as I recall, as Senator Hawley discussed yesterday, he specifically asked for images of 11 to 17 year olds. So I don't understand how that can be an instance where that shouldn't matter, and where the fact that he did it with the computer, hardly atones for what he was doing, hardly offsets the fact that he was seeking and obtained pre-pubescent child pornography images. Nor does the fact that the images become easier over time to transmit and receive and store because of computers. I actually think it cuts in precisely the opposite direction that you described. It makes it more severe, not less. I see this as an aggravating factor and that is of great concern to me. I see I have exceeded my time. Thank you.
[00:19:33]
JKBJ:
Senator as in every child pornography case that I sentenced. I considered all of the evidence, all of the relevant factors. It is not the same exercise to look at a transcript, to think about guidelines, to not have in front of you, the individuals, the victims, the pictures, the circumstances that trial judges have to review in these cases or any cases. I understand Senator, that there are some questions about records, ect. Courts have all of the evidence and courts have all of the recommendations of various parties and courts have, under Congress's authority, the responsibility of using our judgment to make determinations that are sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes or promote the purposes of punishment taking into account  things like unwarranted sentencing disparities. It may seem like an easy exercise, it may seem in retrospect, when you look back at a few pieces of data, that courts have not done what it is that they are supposed to do, but what I can assure you is that I took every one of these cases seriously, in my duty, and responsibility as a judge, and I made my determinations in light of the seriousness of the offense, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to promote various purposes of punishment, and all of the other factors that Congress prescribed.
[00:21:37]
MSL:
Okay, but you keep resetting that standard, and you specifically excluded from consideration the fact that he had requested and obtained images, prepubescent child pornography images.
[00:21:52]
JKBJ:
Senator, I didn't exclude it. I didn't exclude it. What I did was I looked at the guidelines, which is what the Supreme Court requires, and I was making policy determinations as the Supreme Court says that judges are to do in these situations.
[00:22:08]
MSL:
Look at page 38 of your transcript. It looks to me like you excluded it and your actions sentencing him to three months, for one of the most heinous offenses imaginable, keep in mind because these are transmitted electronically, they are there for years. They re-victimize these victims the rest of their lives.

Title: Senator Lee Introduces Resolution to Maintain Undivided Jerusalem Embassy
Date: March 22, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced a concurrent resolution today reaffirming Congress’s position that the United States should be represented by a single diplomatic mission in Jerusalem.  The Biden Administration has previously stated its intent to create a consulate general in Jerusalem dedicated to Palestinian affairs.  The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, passed into law by Congressional supermajority recognizes that Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel and the U.S. embassy to Israel should be in Jerusalem.
Senator Lee’s resolution states Congress’s opposition to any establishment of a separate U.S. diplomatic office for Palestinian affairs within Jerusalem and expresses that such a plan violates the intent of current U.S. law and is an affront to a U.S. ally and therefore should not move forward in the absence of congressional authorization.
Regarding the resolution,
Sen. Lee said
, “
Congress has made clear for decades that the U.S. embassy in Israel should be in Jerusalem.  Now, after we have made the historic and legally required move, President Biden risks upsetting allies, a delicate diplomatic balance, and the authority of the law.  This resolution will reassert Congress’s clear position that the U.S. embassy should be in Jerusalem and it should not be divided.”
Sen. Lee is joined in this effort by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Steve Daines (R-WY), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Roger Marshall (R-KS), John Hoeven (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and John Boozman (R-AR) as cosponsors.

Title: Senator Lee Questions SCOTUS Nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson
Date: March 22, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States today.  His questions focused on her judicial philosophy, her record on criminal sentencing, and her views on unenumerated constitutional rights.  A full transcript of the exchange is below.
MSL indicates Sen. Lee is speaking.  JKBJ and italics indicate Judge Jackson is speaking.  Timestamps are in reference to the above-linked video.
[00:00:00]
MSL:
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Judge Jackson for being here. I want to talk today about some things you heard about yesterday. There was a lot of talk from members of this committee about judicial philosophy. I want to talk a little bit about what that means and why it's important. We'll start with what it means, at least to me.
One of the things that you heard from a lot of members of the committee, whether they couched it in terms of judicial philosophy or not, [00:00:30] relates to the idea that justice should be blind. That justice properly administered within our system is blind, and that therefore individual justices and judges serving in Article III courts should be blind in the sense that they are able to see and understand and interpret the law. Understand what the law is, while understanding that the idea of what the law should be is left to [00:01:00] other branches of government, not to the judiciary.
In this respect, we recognize that blind justice and blind justices, those who are blind to the things they are supposed to be blind to, are those willing to recognize that if there is a policy flaw in the law, and if there's a policy change that needs to be made, it's not the role of a court to change it.
That belongs to two different branches of government, primarily to Congress. This of course requires judicial restraint, it [00:01:30] requires judicial humility, and it gets back to what I was describing yesterday when I referred to Justice Barrett drawing on the analogy from the Odyssey, of Odysseus binding himself to the mast of the ship.
Most of us refer to this judicial philosophy as textualism. Textualism is neither liberal nor conservative, it's neither Republican nor Democratic. It's just the approach that says what the law says [00:02:00] matters, and the job of the jurist is to look at the text and figure out what the text means to ascertain the original public meaning of the text in question.
While I doubt there are any members of this committee who would disagree with the idea that justice should be blind in this respect, and that policy changes need to be made by the political branches of government, primarily by the legislative branch, and not by the courts. You did hear some statements that I think are at least a little bit at odds [00:02:30] with that concept of justice.
One of my colleagues mentioned that you should interpret the Constitution in a way that works for the people of today. Fair enough. I certainly don't want to interpret the Constitution in a way that doesn't work, but again, that's not the objective. The objective is not to ascertain good policy. The objective is to ascertain what the law requires.
You were urged to consider the effects of the Court's actions on people's lives. There again, [00:03:00] and so far as this relates to policy, it's not really the job of the courts. You were admonished that you must “be able to see the real people at the other end of the Court's rulings, like Americans who are one Supreme Court decision away from losing their health insurance or one court decision away from the ability to make their own healthcare choices.”
And the list goes on and on. Now, that type of judicial philosophy would have you step into the role of [00:03:30] policymaker, and decide what the law should be rather than what the law is. You also heard quoted, a couple of times yesterday, quoted or paraphrased or otherwise referenced, Federalist 78. In which Alexander Hamilton refers to the difference between law between will and judgment. Will, as expressed by Hamilton, refers to what the law should be. Judgment pertains to what the law is.[00:04:00]
The judicial branch has the latter power, but not the former. The legislative branch has the former, but not the latter. Judge Jackson, I'd love to get your thoughts on this discussion about what it means, what blind justice is, why that's important. Let's start with this formulation of it though.
Does the law determine the outcome of a case or does the outcome of the case determine the law?[00:04:30]
JKBJ:
Thank you, Senator. The law determines the outcome of a case.
And so anytime you're looking at a case and you're looking at the outcomes for ordinary Americans, for day-to-day Americans, if you're looking beyond the scope of deciding that case, and if you're looking, even within that case, beyond what the law says, you would be stepping into a province of a different branch. Is that right?
[00:04:53]
JKBJ:
I believe so. The law and the facts of the case determine the outcome of cases.
[
00:05:00]
[00:05:02]
MSL:
I think that's an accurate statement. It's important to emphasize this. This is also something that Hamilton describes in Federalist 78, where he goes on to say, anytime you start to see the courts start to exercise will instead of judgment, the result is supplanting the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives, through the courts.
And that tends to undermine the whole system. You see, there's a reason, of course, why we give life tenure to Article III judges [00:05:30] and justices, and that is because we want to make sure that they have the power, the authority, the discretion, and the confidence to issue a decision that they might not be comfortable with.
In fact, a judge who always agrees with and is always comfortable with his or her own opinions, is, as Justice Scalia used to say, not a very good judge. So we wanted them, you, all, to have confidence in being able to make the right decision. Even knowing that you [00:06:00] and the public at large might be uncomfortable with the result it produces.
Congress makes laws that you won't always agree with. Congress is accountable to the people at regular intervals. You can fire every member of the House of Representatives every two years. You can fire one-third of us in the Senate every two years. We insulate judges and Supreme Court Justices from that same accountability precisely for this reason.
It's [00:06:30] because political accountability is so important. This is born out in the judicial oath, one of the oaths that you'll take if confirmed to this position as an associate justice. In which you'll swear or affirm that you'll administer justice without respect to persons, and that you'll do it faithfully and impartially.
I read this to mean that you do it without consideration of external circumstances, external considerations, policy considerations, or otherwise. [00:07:00] Now, this relates to some interaction that you and I had when you came before this committee for your confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where you now sit. In connection with that hearing, I submitted some questions to the record, in which I asked you whether, to what extent, the Constitution protects rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution itself, and if so, to specify what those rights were. You responded by setting a number of cases, [00:07:30] including
Griswold v. Connecticut, Roe v. Wade, Loving v. Virginia
and a handful of others. You also suggested that the Ninth Amendment was something, was a source, for such rights on enumerated rights.
The Ninth Amendment of course states, “that the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Judge Jackson, what specific rights has the Supreme Court identified as [00:08:00] flowing from the Ninth Amendment? And by that, I mean, specifically from the Ninth Amendment, rather than, in sort of an also ran list, of other features of the Constitution that might backup a particular ruling. What rights has the Constitution identified as flowing specifically from the Ninth Amendment?
[00:08:19]
JKBJ:
Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court, as I understand it, has not identified any particular rights flowing directly from the Ninth Amendment, although, as you said, the text of the amendment
[00:08:30]
suggests that there are some rights that are not enumerated.
[00:08:35]
MSL:
Right. Right. Its very existence and its very language suggests that, which opens up other questions as to how those are to be resolved. It’s led to considerable debate among scholars and jurists alike as to whether, to what extent, in what way, this is enforceable, those rights are enforceable by the courts.
But, how would we go about deciding that? How would [00:09:00] jurists go about deciding this question appropriately? In other words, would it be more appropriate to say, we will ascertain the existence of rights protected by the Ninth Amendment based on contemporaneous understanding, at the time of the ratification of the Ninth Amendment? Or would it be more open ended to protect rights that we think are important today?[00:09:30]
[00:09:32]
JKBJ:
Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court now, very clearly, has determined that in order to interpret provisions of the Constitution, we look to the time of the founding, and we ascertain, based on what the original public meaning of the words the Constitution were at the time. Sometimes that yields a
[00:10:00] p
articular answer. Other times you may have to look to practices historically from that time. But that would be the way in which you would go about interpreting the Ninth Amendment.
[00:10:11]
MSL:
Could it also be that it leaves this to be decided at the discretion of the Supreme Court itself? In other words, not based on any historical precedent, but based on what the Supreme Court justices themselves deem appropriate at the moment? [00:10:30]
[00:10:30]
JKBJ:
I don't think so.
MSL:
And why is that?
JKBJ:
Because the way in which the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution is with reference to the meaning of the text at the time That it is one of the constraints, as I mentioned, in terms of my own way of handling, interpreting the law. One of the constraints is that you're bound by the text and
[00:11:00]
what it meant to those who drafted it.
[00:11:04]
MSL:
At the time, gotcha. Yeah. Now, on February 1st of this year, President Biden said that he was looking for a Supreme Court nominee, this was, I recall, right after Justice Breyer announced that he would be stepping down, and before he had announced whom he might nominate, that he was looking for a nominee “with a judicial philosophy that is more one that suggests that there are unenumerated rights to the Constitution, and all new members mean something, including the Ninth Amendment.” So do you share the judicial philosophy that President Biden described in that statement?
[00:11:45]
JKBJ:
Senator, I have not reviewed that statement, but I have not discussed anything about enumerated rights, unenumerated rights with the President.
MSL:
So did President Biden ask you either about your judicial philosophy more broadly, separate and apart from the Ninth Amendment, or ask you about your approach to the Ninth Amendment?
JKBJ:
He did not.
[00:12:12]
MSL:
In a primary election debate that he had as a presidential candidate in Nevada in 2007, Joe Biden stated “I would not appoint anyone who did not understand that Section V of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provided a right to privacy. That's the question I'd ask them. If that is answered correctly, that that is the case, that it answers the question which means they would support Roe v. Wade.” I assume his reference to the Liberty Clause is referring to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In context, that appears to be what he is saying. Did President Biden ask you whether you agreed with his analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment as it relates to the right to privacy?
[00:13:05]
JKBJ:
He did not.
[00:13:12]
MSL:
Tell me this. When we look at any provision of the Constitution,  one of the many reasons it is helpful to look at the original understanding, in addition to the fundamental reason that you described, it can help us understand what motivated it, and it can help us understand the actions of those who voted within Congress to propose text to be amended to the Constitution, and those who voted to ratify it. We have got a number of amendments, including the amendment that he referred to in that last quote I read, that had an understanding that included certain thou shalt nots for government. The Equal Protection Clause, I think, is a provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that, people understood, among anything else it might do, restricts the government's ability to treat people differently on the basis of race. Consistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, when is it permissible for the government to treat a person differently on the basis of race?
[00:14:29]
JKBJ:
Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court has interpreted the equal protection clause, as you say, to generally prohibit classifications on the basis of race, and it says that those classifications are to be rigorously scrutinized, strict scrutiny, which is a standard that applies, that looks at the purposes of the government, and the means by which the government seeks to achieve any end related to such classification. The government would have to have a compelling interest in making that classification, and the means that it selects would have to be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
[00:15:21]
MSL:
And so those compelling interests cannot be for light or transient reasons. They can't just be something like, we feel like it, in other words.
[00:15:30]
JKBJ:
Correct.
[00:15:31]
MSL:
And the reason for this is because, number one, it is bad for anyone to treat another person differently on the basis of race. It is especially bad when the government does it, because there is not exactly equal bargaining power, when you're dealing with the relationship an individual has with government. By definition, it's a particularly unfair form of discrimination when it is the government doing it. Governments have enforcement officers, they have armies, they have the means of enforcing their will and their laws, and that is one of the reasons why it's so important. What about under statute, consistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when is it permissible for an employer to treat an employee, or a prospective employee, differently on the basis of his or her race?
JKBJ:
By statute, under Title VII, it is generally impermissib
le.
[00:16:30]
MSL:
And permissible only in very narrow circumstances.
[00:16:34]
JKBJ:
I believe so, and the statute itself has some restrictions in terms of to whom it applies, the employers.
[00:16:42]
MSL:
Some exclusions in terms of religious employers for example, not being able to discriminate on the basis of race, but it exempts religious employers within certain spheres in order to be able to protect that religious employer’s discretion to operate within its faith, and the rules of its faith. And by doing that, it makes that much clearer, by making that distinction, it makes that much clearer, that discrimination on the basis of race and employment is not something that the law smiles upon, nor should it. Let us talk about the Commerce Clause for a minute, if that is all right. Now at the time of the founding, the founding fathers didn't foresee and almost certainly could not have foreseen the invention of radios, televisions, airplanes, the internet, telephone networks, and yet all of those things are governed by federal law, and not by state law. Why is this constitutional?
[00:17:58]
JKBJ:
Well Senator, the Commerce Clause was initially interpreted by the Supreme Court to be very broad, to allow for federal regulation of interstate commerce and the growth of the economy in this country. Over time, the Supreme Court has made clear that the Commerce Clause limits the federal government, there is limited authority under the Commerce Clause. The state of the law now is such that the federal government, through the Commerce Clause, is only permitted to regulate channels of interstate commerce, instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, and with respect to the third category, the Supreme Court has made clear, in the Lopez case and in Morrison, that non-economic activities are not covered by Commerce Clause authority. In the NFIB case and the ACA case, the Supreme Court made clear that inactivity is also not covered and not authorized under the Commerce Clause.
[00:19:17]
MSL:
And most of the items that I identified in my question, in fact, all of them, I believe would fall into the category of channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce we are dealing [00:19:30] with interstate airways, airwaves, waterways, networks, things like that. Things that depend for their existence, for their effectiveness on their operation interstate such that they could not, no one could effectively regulate them and preserve their core function, unless that was federal. Those fit into the category of the channels and instrumentalities with the third item that you described the substantial [00:20:00] effects, interstate commerce. Is there much of a limiting principle there? You referred to
Lopez and Morrison, and NFIB versus Sebelius
. To my knowledge, those are the only three cases the Supreme Court has decided since its ruling in 1937 on
NLRB versus Jones and Loughlin Steel
, which essentially created the modern substantial effects case.
The modern substantial effects standard was the only three instances in which the Supreme court identified [00:20:30] as outside the Commerce Clause authority, something that Congress had enacted. Are these meaningful constraints in your view, or are they examples of Congress just getting reckless and sloppy in the way it drafted things?
Some have argued for instance that as long as Congress does not get reckless and sloppy, it can do whatever it wants under those. Do you have any view on that?
[00:21:08]
JKBJ:
Well these cases come through the courts, so I'll be general.
[00:21:00]
The fact that Congress is limited in its authority under the commerce clause is established law. It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional order and those limits that the Supreme Court has recognized do carve out categories of activity that Congress is not permitted, the federal government is not permitted to regulate.
[00:21:30]
Non-economic activity is a category. Inactivity is a category.
MSL:
The Supreme Court has also, through the Commerce Clause, established rules for things that the states may not do, this is referred to as the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause. The Dormant Commerce Clause acknowledges the power of Congress, the exclusive [00:22:00] domain of Congress is regulating interstate commerce. But there's no federal cause of action to allow for the invalidation of a state law under the commerce clause.
It's been something that's been adopted by the courts. Is that an appropriate exercise of the court's judicial power or does it amount to de facto legislation on the part of the courts?
[00:22:21]
JKBJ:
Well Senator, I would not characterize it. I know that's what the Supreme Court has permitted the Dormant Commerce Clause.
[00:22:30]
It is a principle that supports the interstate nature and regulation and authority of the federal government.
And so states are not permitted under that doctrine to discriminate against other states, to preference their own commerce in a way that interferes with interstate commerce.
[00:22:57]
MSL:
I wanna turn back for a moment to a line [00:23:00] of inquiry you had with Senator Durbin earlier today, when you were talking about your sentencing in these child pornography cases. I wanna make sure that I understand your answer there.
If I understand it, you were making the argument that your concern was that the laws in this area did not adequately take into account the transfer of these materials [00:23:30] by electronic means to be transmitted, received and stored through computers. Is that my understanding of that correctly?
[00:23:39]
JKBJ:
Well Senator, the point that I was making was that the sentencing commission back when I was part of it and even since, tasked with the responsibility to evaluate and make recommendations and look at the data and information about cases, has
[00:24:00]
looked at the operation of the child pornography guideline.
Not so much the statute, but the guidelines, which the Congress has tasked the Sentencing Commission with developing. And there are aspects of the child pornography guideline that Congress in legislation has required. It required certain enhancements to be included in the guideline. And some of those enhancements, the
[00:24:30]
data is now revealing. Don’t take into account the change in the way that this horrible offense is now committed.
[00:24:46]
MSL:
But the fact that it's easier to commit the offense shouldn't diminish the severity of the punishment, should it? I mean, any more than the more widespread availability of certain drugs, the more widespread availability of certain weapons might. I mean you surely wouldn't [00:25:00] argue for a lower sentence when certain things become easier in other criminal contexts. So why is this one different?
[00:25:07]
JKBJ:
The sentencing enhancements that are in the guidelines are designed to help courts differentiate between different levels of culpability. Congress will say, this is an offense, whatever it is, and the maximum penalty
[00:25:30]
is X. In most cases, the range is between zero and something like 20 years that Congress gives when it establishes a penalty.
The point of the guidelines is to help judges figure out where in that range between zero and 20 years, a particular defendant should be sentenced. And the guidelines have gradations in them,
[00:26:00]
that relates to various aspects of the commission of the crime. So, the commission does data gathering and research to figure out how crimes are committed and what gradations should it matter in terms of the range of culpability. Because the problem of not doing that or of getting it wrong is that you were not able
[00:26:30]
to adequately assess and determine the differences among offenders on the scale.
[00:26:39]
MSL:
Right, I understand that. And so, but in, in these cases, as I understand it all ten of the cases that we've reviewed on record, where you've sent someone for a child pornography conviction in all 10 of those cases, you departed from the guidelines,and departed downward.
It's hard for me to [00:27:00] understand departing from those in every case you've got, because isn't a departure supposed to be grounded in a finding that it's outside the heartland of cases in that range cases of that sort?
[00:27:15]
JKBJ:
Yes, Senator. And as I said before, these are horrible cases that involve terrible crimes, and the court is looking at all of the evidence consistent with Congress' factors
[00:27:30]
for sentencing. The guidelines are one factor, but the court is told that you look at the guidelines, but you also look at the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and, and characteristics of the offender.
There are a series of factors in the cases you are also getting recommendations. And in most of the cases, I haven't pinned it all down, but in most of the cases, if not all of the cases, the government
[00:28:00]
is asking for a sentence below the guidelines, because this guideline system is not doing the work in this particular case.
[00:28:08]
MSL:
Understood. Section 230 of the Telecommunication Decency Act provides a degree of immunity for tech companies operating in the space of being online interactive service providers. It immunizes them from certain causes of action that would otherwise apply [00:28:30] against them.
Would it be within Congress's authority to condition the receipt and availability of Section 230 immunity? On those online interactive service providers operating as a public forum that is not discriminating on the basis of viewpoint or, the viewpoint of those posting on them. Would that be within our [00:29:00] authority?
[00:29:01]
JKBJ:
Senator, I can't comment on a particular issue about whether or not it is constitutional or not. But the criteria that you identify, it would be relevant. I think as to whether or not the government is seeking to regulate along viewpoint lines under the First Amendment. That is something that is,
[00:29:30]
generally impermissible.
[00:29:32]
MSL:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Judge Jackson for joining us today. I appreciated the conversation you and I had in my office a few days ago and your willingness to engage in a lively, interesting conversation during that and look forward to more of that this week. I've enjoyed also meeting your husband and your two lovely daughters. They are wonderful people.
I am grateful to you for your service, your service to the federal judiciary and as a member of the bar. You bring to the court, as I mentioned to you last week, a unique set of experiences. If you are confirmed, you will be someone who has served at all three levels of the federal judiciary, and as a result of that, you will have a perspective that is different than that of most who have served on that Court during the modern era. And I appreciate your willingness to be considered and to be here to talk to us about our questions.
I echo what many of my colleagues have said today in that I am dedicated, as I always have been, to making sure that these hearings are respectful. Engaging in the politics of personal destruction is not something we should ever aspire to. It is something that has occurred on this committee, in the context of Supreme Court nominations. I am pleased to say that it has never been under Republican leadership that such attacks have occurred, and I intend to make sure that this hearing is no exception to that. There are a few reasons for that.
First and foremost, the most obvious, is that respect to human beings requires it. Secondly, it is important because if we focus on personal attacks, that means we will be betraying our duty under the Constitution and to our constituents to make sure that we do our jobs fairly and properly. When we are focused on things that we have no business doing, like bringing forward spurious, last-minute, uncorroborated accusations of a personal nature, we neglect the importance of talking about the jurisprudential role, the philosophy that guides individual jurists, and the document that we have all sworn to uphold and protect, the Constitution of the United States.
It is also important for an additional reason, a third reason. It has to do with the fact that, having been nominated to this position, we know that you stand a very decent likelihood of ultimately being confirmed to this position. In which case, you will serve as a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I think it's important that even when, especially when, we disagree with decisions issued by that tribunal, we as a committee, as the Senate Judiciary Committee, not engage in speech or behavior that would undermine the legitimacy of the Supreme Court of the United States.
You see it is the legitimacy of the courts that gives them their potence, their power, their significance in our system of government. We all have a duty to make sure that we do not undermine that very thing that we purport to be protecting.
Let me tell you some of the things that I look for when reviewing a nominee, and a few things that I intend to focus on in these hearings with you. One of them will involve any nominee’s commitment to judicial self-restraint, to understanding the judicial role, what it is and what it is not. Any judicial nominee these days will acknowledge that he or she understands that the role of the judge is to interpret the law based on what it says, rather than on the basis of the judge's personal opinion. This is all very true. It raises questions as to how exactly that goes about and what steps, what tools, what rhetorical linguistic devices the jurist in question might follow in order to do that.
I am looking for someone who is, ideally, going to echo something that Justice Amy Coney Barrett said in her confirmation proceedings, in which she likened the Constitution, this document, written by wise men, nearly two and a half centuries ago, wise men who I believed were raised up by Almighty God to that very purpose.
To the extent we have followed that document, it has helped foster the development of the greatest civilization the world has ever known, but she likened this, and our commitment to it, as a little like what Odysseus told his crew.
She said the Constitution is like how Odysseus ties himself to the mast to resist the song of the sirens. She then goes on to explain that he told the crew, do not untie me, no matter how much I beg or plead, don't untie me from the mast. He wanted to avoid the tempting call of the sirens.
The tempting call of the sirens is inherent, it is in government itself, it's understandable. And that is why we tie ourselves to it. Critical to that is the federal judiciary: the ultimate backstop, the backstop that’s there to resolve disputes.
Now, the Constitution is not just something for the courts. It is not something that is owned exclusively and independently by the federal judiciary or the Supreme Court itself. But it does play an important role, because the Court is there to resolve disputes that arise within the Court's jurisdiction, as to the meaning of a particular provision of federal law, whether in the Constitution itself, or as enacted into law by Congress.
So we need a jurist who is willing to respect that role and demonstrate judicial humility. What I mean by that is an ability to acknowledge that there are a lot of things, not within the province of the courts, that entail policy, that the job of the Court, of the judiciary is never to exert will or force. It is only judgment. It is discerning what the law says.
A nominee also, I believe, needs to show a steadfast commitment to the principle of separation of powers. There are a couple of forms of separation of powers required by the Constitution, along two axes. One operates along the vertical axis that we call federalism, that says most of the power of government within the United States, most powers that government might exercise are to be exercised at the state and local level. Power that is federal is the exception, not the norm, in our constitutional system of government.
The other form of separation of powers operates along the horizontal axis. It is one that recognizes within the federal government, which is limited, we are going to have one branch, our branch, of Congress that makes the laws, another branch headed by the President, the executive branch, that enforces them, and the third branch, which interprets them, resolving disputes between parties coming before the courts’ jurisdiction.
Third, I think it is important that a jurist within our system of government acknowledge the importance of interpreting the law as it was written, as it was understood by the public at the time of its enactment, if a statute, or if a provision of the Constitution at the time of its ratification. This is part of how we tie ourselves to the mast, making sure that we undertake efforts to make sure that we are interpreting it based on how the public understood those words, regardless of the subjective intent of any particular lawmaker or group thereof. The public meaning at the time it became law.
This is how we maintain the rule of law. This is part of how we have given force to this greatest civilization that human history has ever recorded. It is through the rule of law and tying ourselves to that mast.
There are increasing threats to this. We have seen those threats arise with efforts to delegitimize the Court, and I am sickened every time I see or hear or experience one of those efforts to delegitimize it.
We have heard some today, in fact. Comments that I think, by their very nature, delegitimize the Court. Another thing that can delegitimize the Court are arguments made in favor of packing the Supreme Court. This was attempted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937. It did lasting damage to the Court. It didn't succeed as a legislative matter, but it is arguable that it left a mark, and not a pretty one. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires us to have nine and only nine justices. That is, under the Constitution, left to Congress's determination. But nine is a number that works. It has worked now for 152 years. It is not one that we ought to revisit, and it is one that Supreme Court justices of various ideologies, including your former boss, Justice Breyer, whom I really enjoyed getting to know, when serving as a law clerk on the Supreme Court, enjoyed our conversations with him. He, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Thomas, and so many others have been against that.
We must protect the Court. We may not protect the Court. We lose ability to protect the Court if we allow arguments to take root that are focused on expanding that and turning the Court into a political body.

Title: Senator Lee Leads Letter to Defend Second Amendment
Date: March 11, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
today led a group of twenty Senators in a letter to the Attorney General and the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) expressing concern over the ATF’s use of secret internal guidance to enforce regulations that are not openly published.  This secret guidance has been used to justify the seizure of property and could troublingly be used to prosecute Americans and businesses.
The
letter reads in part
, “We write to express our grave concern over the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives’ (ATF) continued pattern of enforcing secret guidance.  This secret guidance was brought to our attention by those who have received recent threatening letters where the ATF makes blanket threats based on the recipient allegedly purchasing and possessing various firearms accessories, none of which are illegal based on any statute or regulation.”
“We find the ATF’s attempt to conceal its interpretations of the law disturbing.  In a free society, ‘Every citizen is presumed to know the law.’  Thus, as the Supreme Court has said, ‘it needs no argument to show that all should have free access’ to [the law’s] contents.”
The letter continues, “With this attempted secret regulation, the ATF shows an abject disregard for the fundamental principles of due process and accountable governance. Federal agencies cannot enforce the law in this manner.
The signatories as of this release are:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)
Sen. James E. Risch (R-ID)
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC)
Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL)

Travis R. White, President and CEO of the Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition said of the letter
, “
The Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition (“FRAC”) sincerely appreciates Senator Lee for his initiative and steadfast leadership in this matter, and his unwavering resolve to stand with industry and the American People in demanding accountability, transparency, and fairness (A-T-F) from the ATF. The ATF’s recent abuses—to include the use of secretive rules and documents—is a gross dereliction of fundamental regulatory ethics and we are proud to stand with Senator Lee and his colleagues in the Senate in demanding answers from ATF.
”
Aidan Jonhnston, Director of Federal Affairs of Gun Owners of America said of the effort
, “
The ATF will stop at nothing to criminalize gun owners and attack the Second Amendment. This time, their scheme is to criminalize solvent traps -- tools that gun owners use while cleaning their firearms. By mislabeling solvent traps as silencers, the ATF makes it clear that they not only do not understand how firearms really work, but also that they are willing to turn law-abiding Americans into criminals overnight to push their anti-gun agenda.

Title: Senator Lee Introduces Bill to Help Victims of Vaccine Adverse Reactions
Date: March 11, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced his Countermeasure Injury Compensation Amendment Act to help those who have suffered adverse reactions from the COVID-19 vaccines.  Current law provides redress measures for patients who have suffered adverse reactions to vaccines and other countermeasures used to promote public health.  Unfortunately, the thousands of patients who have sought relief for adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines have not received compensation under the existing framework.
Senator Lee’s bill would amend the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Act (CICP) to improve responsiveness, create a commission to examine the injuries directly caused as a result of COVID-19 countermeasures, and allow those whose claims have been previously rejects to resubmit claims for new consideration.
Regarding the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The federal government has encouraged all Americans to receive the COVID-19 vaccines.  While these vaccines have been miraculous and have helped save innumerable lives, there are always some who experience adverse reactions.  My Countermeasure Injury Compensation Amendment Act will help build trust in future medical treatments and to make sure those who were harmed are properly compensated.
”
Brianne Dressen
, a Utah mother who experienced a serious adverse reaction as a participant in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial,
said of the bill
,  “
What would this bill mean?
It would mean those who are suffering adverse reactions will no longer have to decide between putting the bread on the table or picking up that critical prescription from the pharmacyor paying rent vs going to the doctor.  For those of us waiting for critical compensation, this bill very well could be the difference between healing, and suffering and declining.
”
Sen. Lee is joined by Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) as cosponsors.

Title: Senator Lee Introduces Supply Chain Bill to Counter Inflation
Date: March 10, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced the SHIP IT Act today to help ease the nations supply chain crisis and counter rising inflation by simplifying or suspending certain federal regulations on ports, ships, and trucks.  Empty shelves and backlogged ports have wreaked havoc on American businesses and families.  This bill focuses on streamlining the process to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves.
The SHIP IT Act builds on and expands Sen. Lee’s STOP the GRINCH Act which was introduced in 2021. For details of the bill, a one-pager of the bill can be read
here
.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said,
“
The SHIP IT Act will help
us ease our port congestion at the source and combat
rising inflation.  Our supply chains and distribution networks are struggling under the combined weight of increased demand, global disruption, and heavy federal regulation.  This bill will provide the relief our nation’s supply chains need to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves, and help Utah families get everyday necessities at prices they can afford.
”
Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is a cosponsor of the bill.
Sen. Lummis said,
“Congress must find ways to relieve the pressures of the supply chain crisis on people in Wyoming. The SHIP IT Act would cut red tape and ease factors that are increasing prices and slowing down shipping times for goods that we need. I am happy to work with Senator Mike Lee on this bill.”

Title: Senator Lee Leads Letter to Defund Federal Vaccine Mandates
Date: March 4, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
today led a group of Senators in defense of Americans targeted by President Biden’s vaccine mandates, making clear in a letter to colleagues they will not consent to expedited passage of a funding bill that allows the vaccine mandates to continue. At minimum, the Senators demanded a roll call vote on an amendment to defund the enforcement of remaining federal vaccine mandates on government contractors, members of the military, all other federal employees, and medical care providers.
The letter reads in part “
We have consistently opposed President Biden’s federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which would force millions of Americans to choose between an unwanted medical procedure and being able to provide for their families. For legal, constitutional, and policy reasons, we remain strongly opposed to the mandates and will continue to work to end their imposition on Americans
.
The letter continues, “
These COVID-19 vaccine mandates amount to a serious abuse of both federal power and executive authority.  … President Biden has no business forcing people to make a tragic choice between unemployment and an unwanted vaccination. Additionally, it is particularly troubling for the President to ask thousands of troops to amass in eastern Europe while simultaneously demanding they get a politicized vaccine.
“
History will bear record of whether we chose to endure tyranny, or oppose it, in this pivotal moment. We invite you to stand with us and oppose the continued funding of these mandates.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill Countering Inflation
Date: March 3, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced the Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act today. This bill builds upon Senator Lee’s budget amendment that received 49 votes during the August 2021 budget reconciliation process. The PRICE Act requires a 3/5 majority of Senators to approve new spending measures when the nation’s inflation rate is at or above 3%. Runaway federal spending has been a major contributor to current inflation, which is now charted as the highest rate in four decades.
This bill follows a
report on inflation
from Senator Lee’s
Social Capital Project
. The report shows that while nationally inflation is at 7.5%, in Utah and other Mountain West states, inflation is much higher at 9%. Nationally families pay an extra $385 a month due to inflation; in Utah, the average family pays an extra $511 a month due to increased inflation.
Of the bill and rising inflation
Sen. Lee said
, “
Inflation is a hidden tax making life more expensive for and harder on Utah families. The federal government is largely to blame for this prolonged spike in the cost of living, and we must do more to restrain spending and give security to Utah families. I am committed to protecting the Utah way of life and keeping our communities affordable for hardworking Utah families. The PRICE Act will help do just that.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill Granting Immediate SSDI Benefits for Terminally Ill
Date: March 2, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced his Immediate Access for the Terminally Ill Act today.  The bill would allow terminally ill patients with certain diagnoses with limited life expectancies to choose to forego the current five-month waiting period and receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits immediately.
Of the bill
Sen. Lee said
, “
Social Security Disability Insurance provides a financial safety net for disabled workers but requires a five-month waiting period prior to receipt of benefits. Unfortunately, for some Americans who suffer from illnesses that are clearly disabling long-term, have short life expectancies, and have no known cure, five months is simply too long. If passed, my bill could put SSDI benefits into patients’ hands sooner, relieving some of the stress associated with end-of-life care."
Stan Lockhart
, a Utah advocate for those with rare diseases who lost his wife, former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives, Becky Lockhart, to Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease, said of the bill, “
In the blink of an eye, a rare disease can flip a family’s life upside down. I have seen firsthand the pain and difficulty rare diseases can inflict. Waiting periods and bureaucratic red tape can make the most stressful moments of a family's life even worse. Senator Lee's Immediate Access for the Terminally Ill Act, gives families the option to receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits when they need them, and unlike far too much lawmaking in this space, it puts families in control. The bill doesn't prioritize one disease over others; it provides fair relief to patients with rare diseases while protecting taxpayer resources. I endorse this bill wholeheartedly."

Title: Senator Lee Introduces 1031 Exchange Improvement Act
Date: February 18, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
introduced the 1031 Exchange Improvement Act which would eliminate the current 45-day requirement to identify 1031 exchange properties.  1031 exchanges allow taxpayers to roll earnings from real estate sales into near-term future investment properties while deferring the capital gain tax burden until the eventual sale of the ultimate property.  The Internal Revenue Service had extended the 45-day period to 120 days during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bill has received wide support from tax reform and taxpayer advocacy groups.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said, “
The 1031 Exchange Improvement Act will allow American investors to acquire new properties in a tight real estate market without the ticking time bomb of the IRS looming over their shoulders.  This bill will allow Americans flexibility to make the best decisions while still protecting federal revenue.”
Pete Sepp
, President of the National Taxpayers Union said of the bill, “
NTU supports a variety of policies that would simplify tax administration for taxpayers as well as the IRS, and real estate and investment transactions are a particularly complex area of law. Sen. Lee's 1031 Exchange Improvement Act would simplify like-kind exchanges for investors, making this provision of the code work more smoothly for everyone involved. We applaud Sen. Lee for introducing this commonsense proposal.
”
Grover Norquist
, President of Americans for Tax Reform said, “
I urge you to support and co-sponsor the “1031 Exchange Improvement Act,” legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah.) to simplify Section 1031 “like-kind exchanges.” Specifically, this legislation would repeal the requirement that a taxpayer utilizing a 1031 exchange must identify a second property within 45 days. All Senators should support this legislation.  … The 45-day period to identify 1031 exchange properties imposes a strict deadline on property buyers, forcing them to make rushed decisions. Repealing this deadline, while retaining the 180-day deadline will help streamline 1031 compliance so that the provision can continue to be used by taxpayers to invest and grow the economy.
”
Senator Lee is joined in this effort by Sen. Mike Braun (IN), Sen. Ted Cruz (TX), and Sen. Roger Marshall (KS) as cosponsors.

Title: Sen. Mike Lee remarks on the passing of Walter Estes Dellinger III
Date: February 18, 2022

Content:
Walter Dellinger was a scholar, a friend, and a lawyer’s lawyer.
I first met him when I invited him to speak at a religious freedom conference I helped organize while I was in law school. His presentation was exceptional, and he showed genuine interest in teaching and uplifting every person with whom he interacted.
One of those people was my father, who (unbeknownst to me prior to the conference) had known Walter for years and considered him a friend. My dad was battling late-stage cancer at the time, and didn’t have long to live. Sensing that he’d likely never see my dad again, Walter went out of his way to thank him for attending, praise him for his contributions to both the study and practice of law, and seek his advice regarding the role of the Solicitor General (Walter was about to be named to that post, which my dad had held more than a decade earlier).
My dad died just a few weeks after the conference. A few months after my dad’s death, Walter hosted a wonderful memorial service for my father at the Department of Justice, where he offered kind words of condolence to my family.
A few years later, Walter served as opposing counsel in a case my brother and I litigated—a case that culminated in arguments before the Supreme Court. After Walter’s client won the case in a complicated, split ruling, Walter called us to offer his perspective on the case, pointing out interesting nuances in the Court’s ruling, and praising us for the manner in which we had handled the case.
In the decades since then, Walter and I have continued to visit from time to time, and I have always left our conversations feeling uplifted and educated by his wisdom—just as I have felt on each of the many occasions when he has testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I have served for the last 11 years.
In every conversation I have ever had with him, Walter has offered encouragement, kind words, and sound advice. And although he and I had very different political views, that didn’t matter to him; friendship easily overcame politics for Walter.
I’m grateful to have known Walter Dellinger, and mourn his loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Title: Senate Passes Legislation Establishing Internment Camp Historic Site

WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT)
and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) reached agreement on establishing the Amache Internment Camp site in Granada, Colorado as a national historic site. While both Senators had sought to commemorate the horrors of Japanese internment, they haddifferent approaches After debate on the Senate floor, the members agreed to a compromise solution.
Sen. Lee said
in the Senate debate, “
No person should ever be in prison solely due to their race, that shouldn’t even be a factor in anyone's imprisonment. Certainly not in the United States of America. Japanese internment is one of the very worst examples of our government rejecting its founding principles. It's something that should be remembered so that it can never be repeated. …”
“Regrettably, the United States has failed to meet other, admittedly far less fundamental obligations it has made to individuals and states. One of those obligations is relevant here. … The federal government has neglected commitments made by Congress to western states and the time or their admission is dispose of their large swaths of federal land.”
Lee
continued, “
I have been wrongfully portrayed by some in the media as being somehow against this historical recognition, and against commemorating, as a warning to future generations and to honor the victims of the past, one of this nations and its government's tragic missteps. I continue to negotiate in good faith to find a way forward with this bill.”
After the floor exchange, the Senate unanimously passed a compromise bill that would allow for the federal acquisition of the site at no cost to taxpayers.

Title: Sen. Lee Celebrates Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act
Date: February 2, 2022

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT) celebrated the Ghost Army today as the group is honored with the Congressional Gold Medal.  Sen. Lee championed this bill through its passage in the Senate and the House of Representatives and has been an advocate for the group’s recognition.
The Ghost Army refers to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Company Special, units dedicated to military deception.  Through sound effects, prop vehicles, and false radio transmissions these units misdirected the enemy and contributed to the success of vital military campaigns.  Due to the top secret nature of their missions, the units’ achievements remained classified for decades after the war.
Sen. Mike Lee: Understanding No Greater Love
Sen. Lee previously highlighted the group in a 2021
Deseret News editorial
.
Of the group
Sen. Lee wrote
, “
We give thanks to the brave and creative soldiers who lost their lives while serving in the Ghost Army … Staff Sgt. Stanley Nance, a Utah centenarian who fought alongside the fallen, described his role as one designed to save lives; to save the lives of other soldiers so that ‘one new wife or one mother (could be) spared putting a gold star in their front window.
”
Regarding the
bill’s signing
,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The Ghost Army’s sacrifice and dedication is a key part to our nation’s history in the Second World War.  Men from Utah and across the nation joined together in creativity and craftmanship to counter cruelty and evil itself.  They are heroes and it is fitting that they be recognized today with the highest honor Congress can bestow.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce Bill Giving Pregnant Moms Child Tax Credit
Date: January 31, 2022

WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee
(R-UT) along with colleague Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) and others reintroduced the “Child Tax Credit for Pregnant Moms Act,” which allows pregnant moms to claim the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for their unborn children.  This is a continuation of Lee’s efforts to expand the Child Tax Credit.  Sen. Lee was a primary advocate for the CTC expansion in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and pushed CTC expansion in COVID relief legislation with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee said
, “
The Child Tax Credit supports families through the increased costs of raising children.  It is a societal statement recognizing the value that children and parents bring to our country, and parenthood begins long before birth.  Utah recognizes the value of families more than anywhere else.  I am honored to support its expansion and to include expectant mothers whose children are not yet born.  This bill will help protect life, support parents, and reduce the number of children born into poverty.”
“Expecting parents begin providing and preparing for their child the minute they learn they’re having a baby—the Child Tax Credit should reflect the fact that unborn children are children too,”
Sen. Daines said.
“From prenatal care to stocking up on baby supplies, this tax relief will help parents prepare for the arrival of their baby.”

Of the nomination,
Sen. Lee
said,
“Trina Higgins is a fantastic choice to be the next United States Attorney for the District of Utah. I had the honor of working with Trina during a part of her nearly two decades in the U.S. Attorney’s office. In our interactions, she always proved herself to be a dedicated, disciplined prosecutor. Her integrity and commitment will serve the people of Utah well in her new role as she continues to uphold the rule of law.”
Sen. Romney
said,
“After reviewing her record and qualifications, and meeting with her personally, it is clear that Trina Higgins is exceptionally qualified to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah. For the last two decades, she has served Utah in the U.S. Attorney’s Office as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, where she has held several positions including Special Counsel to Litigative Programs, Violent Crime Section Chief, and Tribal Liaison. I have full confidence that Trina will serve Utah and our country with honor and integrity, and I look forward to supporting her nomination when it comes before the Senate.”

Of the pro-life movement,
Sen. Lee said
,
“
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; inalienable rights, endowed by our Creator.  This is the promise of America, yet for millions of unborn babies, because of a twisted precedent and a misreading of the Constitution, that promise is denied.  Equality begins in the womb.  God told Jerimiah, “before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee.”  Each precious human life is known and loved by God.
“Tragically, under Roe and its devastating aftermath, the promise of life is denied to far too many babies of both genders, every race, and varying physical ability. Each life has unlimited potential and value.  I pray that this is the last March for Life under Roe.  I pray that we might see each precious baby as a gift from God to be loved and nurtured.  I pray that each life will be valued for what it is, equal, because equality begins in the womb.”
Sen. Lee also asked the Senate to pass his
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act
, a bill that would prohibit U.S. foreign aid dollars being used to promote or conduct abortions abroad, on Thursday, January 20.

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced his Consumer Protection and Due Process Act today to help protect consumers while ensuring due process safeguards in Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proceedings.  The bill provides the FTC with the authority to seek equitable remedies under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act in response to the Supreme Court’s April 2021 that found that the FTC did not have the authority to seek equitable remedies under current law.
Of the bill,

Congress has long tasked the FTC with a broad mission to ‘protect consumers and promote competition’. This bill sets an appropriate balance that ensures the FTC has the tools to protect consumers from fraudulent and dishonest conduct while also ensuring that those tools contain the necessary safeguards to shield Americans and businesses from abuse of agency power and unchecked enforcement.”

Title: Sen. Lee Seeks to Preserve Research Park
Date: December 10, 2021

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has introduced the
University of Utah Research Park Act
to protect and preserve Research Park, a center for research and development serving both the University and the local workforce. Research Park is situated on a parcel of land which was transferred to the University by the Bureau of Land Management in 1965. Sen. Lee’s bill would remove an encumbrance from that transfer agreement to ensure Research Park remains productive and thriving.
Sen. Lee’s University of Utah Research Park Act is cosponsored by Sen. Mitt Romney & was sponsored in the House by Rep. Christ Stewart and cosponsored by Reps. Curtis, Owens, & Moore.
Following the bill’s introduction, Sen. Lee said,
“This simple fix will protect the good work and learning that takes place at Research Park. The Park is home to cutting-edge companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, and manufacturing spaces. The work they do provides for innovation in their fields and offers first-class opportunities for students to work and learn alongside experts. For the good of Utah and the world, this work must continue.”
After sponsoring companion legislation in the House, Rep. Chris Stewart said, “
The important work being done at the University of Utah provides our state with invaluable innovations. I’m proud to stand beside Senator Lee in support of this legislation. And I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in protecting research that will continue to benefit communities across the country.”
University of Utah President Taylor Randall said,
“Since its establishment in 1968, Research Park has become a key component in the university’s mission to foster innovation, advance science and contribute to Utah’s strong economy. The forethought of state and federal leaders in making this investment of land to the university has reaped extraordinary success and resulted in a myriad of scientific discoveries and companies that have improved the health and well-being of all Americans. This public-private partnership remains a case study in how major research universities can contribute to the success of their communities. I support this legislation and the resulting positive impact it will have on the university and our state.”
In a
letter
to Sen. Lee, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said, “
I appreciate your sponsorship of The University of Utah Research Park Act to help Utah and the University of Utah to clean up an encumbrance to the University’s ownership and use of land for Research Park.”
Gov. Cox continued, “
I appreciate your hard work and attention to the needs of our state.”
In a
letter
to Sen. Lee, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said, “
On behalf of Salt Lake City, I support this legislation and look forward to continued partnerships that enhance the quality of life and opportunities for the citizens of Salt Lake.”

Title: Sen. Lee’s Supply-chain Bill to STOP the GRINCH and Save Christmas
Date: November 18, 2021

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the STOP the GRINCH Act today to ease supply-chain and inflation pressures by streamlining or suspending certain federal regulations on ports, ships, and trucks.  Empty shelves and backlogged ports have wreaked havoc on American businesses and families over recent months.  Inflation is at levels not seen in decades making holiday purchases and everyday necessities harder for Utah families to buy.

here
.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said,
“The supply chain crisis is making Thanksgiving meals, Christmas gifts, and everyday necessities more expensive and harder to get.  My STOP the GRINCH Act will help ease supply chain difficulties and get holiday products off of ships, onto trucks, and into stores.  We can STOP the GRINCH and save Christmas.”
The lead sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives,
Rep. Michelle Fischbach
(R-MN-07), said, “
President Biden and Speaker Pelosi think the answer to the supply chain crisis is more wasteful spending and more heavy regulation. They are wrong, and with the holiday season upon us we can’t risk making this crisis worse. The STOP the GRINCH Act will alleviate the backlog at our ports, at a time when the American people need it most.”
Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) joins the effort as a cosponsor.

WASHINGTON

Mike Lee (R-UT) today asked that the Senate pass his resolution supporting a free trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom.  This is a continuation of Lee’s now multi-year advocacy for a free trade deal between the countries.  Such an agreement would be beneficial to both nations and to Utah specifically.  The United Kingdom is Utah’s largest export market with more than $9 billion of exports leaving Utah for the UK in 2019.  Almost 11,000 Utahns are employed by UK subsidiaries, and nearly 40,000 Utah jobs are supported by Utah’s export relationship with Britain.

Title: Utah Delegation Responds to Monument Announcement

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Representatives Chris Stewart (R-UT), John Curtis (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Blake Moore (R-UT) have issued the joint statement below following the announcement of President Joe Biden’s Proclamation to re-expand the boundaries of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.
“President Biden is delivering a devastating blow to the ongoing efforts by our delegation, along with state, local, and tribal leaders, to find a permanent, legislative solution to resolve the longstanding dispute over the boundaries and management of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Rather than take the opportunity to build unity in a divided region and bring resources and lasting protections to sacred antiquities by seeking a mutually beneficial and permanent legislative solution, President Biden fanned the flames of controversy and ignored input from the communities closest to these monuments. We will continue to support efforts to ensure that our monuments’ boundaries and management reflect the unique stakeholder interest and uses in the area, but today’s “winner take all” mentality moved us further away from that goal.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues, Demand DOJ Leave Parents Alone
Date: October 7, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) with the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today demanded the Department of Justice (DOJ) not interfere with local school board meetings or threaten the use of federal law enforcement to deter parents’ free speech. This comes after DOJ issued a memorandum suggesting federal law enforcement may need to assist policing local school board meetings.
“We are concerned about the appearance of the Department of Justice policing the speech of citizens and concerned parents. We urge you to make very clear to the American public that the Department of Justice will not interfere with the rights of parents to come before school boards and speak with educators about their concerns, whether regarding coronavirus-related measures, the teaching of critical race theory in schools, sexually explicit books in schools, or any other topic,”
the senators wrote.
“To be clear, violence and true threats of violence are not protected speech and have no place in the public discourse of a democracy… However, the FBI should not be involved in quashing and criminalizing discourse that is well beneath violent acts… It is not appropriate to use the awesome powers of the federal government – including the PATRIOT Act, a statute designed to thwart international terrorism – to quash those who question local school boards,”
the senators continued.
Last month, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden asking for help from federal law enforcement, referencing the PATRIOT Act, a statute that helps the federal government fight international terrorism. NSBA highlighted situations involving angry parents often frustrated by COVID-19 mask mandates for children and the possibility of incorporating critical race theory into the academic curriculum. Angry parents are not necessarily threatening parents and these discussions are clearly protected under the First Amendment.
In addition to Lee, the letter is signed by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).

Title: Sen. Lee says Inflation “Turbocharged by Congress Spending Money”
Date: October 6, 2021

Content:
“… and it’s gnawing away at Americans’ wages …”
WASHINGTON— In new research, Joint Economic Committee Republicans, led by Ranking Member Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT),  present evidence that rising prices have resulted from both transitory inflation and more lasting inflation caused by government stimulus. If Congress continues to push government spending to new heights, inflation likely worsens.
Prices today are rising at their fastest pace in decades and American concern about inflation is growing. Yet over a year after the recession officially ended, Congress continues to pursue massive new government spending measures—including a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, the single largest spending package in history.
Of the report,
Sen. Lee
said,
“Inflation is rising at its fastest pace in three decades, and it’s gnawing away at Americans’ wages, savings, and aspirations. It’s making it harder for families to afford gas and groceries and make ends meet. In our research released today, the Joint Economic Committee found that these rising prices for everyday goods are being turbocharged by Congress spending money it simply doesn’t have. If we don’t stop this runaway train, inflation could get worse. The best way to strengthen our shared prosperity is to rein in spending and return to the pro-growth policies that made the pre-pandemic economy so successful.”
We urge Congress to consider the inflationary risks of new stimulus. Rising prices are harming American families by reducing their earnings and undercutting their purchasing power. The American people would be better served by policies geared toward returning Americans to work.

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Question DOJ, FTC Antitrust Enforcement
Date: October 5, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Reps. Ken Buck (R-CO), and Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent a letter to Richard Powers, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, and Lina Kahn, Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission questioning the dual antitrust enforcers’ increasingly divergent standards in enforcing the law.
Both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have authority to review mergers and acquisitions and enforce antitrust law generally.  When their enforcement standards diverge, American businesses and citizens can suffer.
The
Senators and Congressmen
wrote in the letter,
“We are worried that your agencies appear to be applying the law unequally to similarly situated respondents, raising serious concerns about the fairness of America’s antitrust enforcement regime. A lack of alignment between DOJ and FTC in antitrust enforcement already has been a problem during previous administrations. We are disappointed to see that trend accelerating under President Biden’s leadership.”
Of the letter,
Sen. Lee
said,
“When Congress gave DOJ and FTC shared merger enforcement powers under the Clayton Act, it never imagined a world in which the two agencies would apply two different legal standards—the very definition of arbitrary and capricious. Sadly, thanks to Chairwoman Khan’s FTC, we live in that world now. It’s time for Congress to fix its century-old mistake and reconsolidate antitrust enforcement at the Department of Justice.”
Sen. Grassley
said,
“When two agencies are looking into essentially the same facts, the law should be applied in a uniform manner. That’s just common sense and fair. But the dual bureaucracies at the FTC and the Justice Department Antitrust Division have had different approaches in how to enforce our antitrust laws. Recently the FTC has diverged even further, raising serious concerns for businesses and consumers. We ought to know if the administration is going to make this problem worse.”
Rep.
Buck
said,
“Congress should pass the package of Big Tech bills to give the FTC more resources and tools to go after the worst actors in our economy. However, the FTC also needs to hold itself to the highest legal and ethical standards as it is a law enforcement agency. Due process protections are vital for all entities involved in our justice system and the FTC should make sure it is honoring the protections that have historically been in place. Not all companies are bad actors and they shouldn’t be treated as such.”
Rep. Jordan
said,
“
The Biden FTC’s abuse of its power to promote radical leftist goals shows why Congress should not give more authority to this rogue agency.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bills to Combat Agriculture Fees
Date: September 27, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced two bills to reform agricultural checkoff programs.  The bills will make checkoff programs more responsive to contributors and voluntary rather than mandatory.  Checkoffs are mandatory Department of Agriculture fees assessed on a per-unit basis that fund boards designed to promote the commodity as a whole.  However, checkoff funds are frequently coopted against the interests of some or even a majority of contributors.  Countless farmers, ranchers, and other producers have seen their checkoff dollars squandered or even used against their interests.  These bills would prohibit certain wasteful, anti-competitive, and deceptive behavior from checkoff board and make checkoff participation voluntary.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said,
“Dozens of checkoff programs impose a cost on farmers, ranchers, and others in exchange for programs that are supposed to benefit contributors. Unfortunately, though foreseeably, obligatory checkoff contributions are often not used in the best interest of all contributors.  These common-sense reforms will ensure that checkoff funds promote and protect those who choose to contribute.”
Joe Maxwell
, President of Family Farm Action said, “We are grateful for Senator Lee's leadership on reining in the abusive practices of the commodity checkoff programs.
"For far too long, farmers and ranchers have been forced to pay into these programs only to see their dollars go to trade and lobbying organizations that work against their very existence. It is time to restore transparency and accountability to the checkoff programs."
Mike Eby
, Executive Director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, said, “Commodity checkoffs have proven time and time again they are illegally using federal tax dollars to lobby Congress in support of policies that hurt family farmers. OCM applauds Sens. Lee, Booker, Paul, Warren, and Gillibrand for reintroducing the OFF Act that would create a system of checks and balances for oversight, transparency, and accountability in these programs.”
Sen. Lee is joined by Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) as cosponsors on the OFF Act, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) as a cosponsor of the Voluntary Checkoff bill.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Act to Protect Downwinders
Date: September 27, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Downwinders Act to renew and extend protections for Utahns and others under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).  Downwinders are residents of certain counties that developed cancer after nearby above-ground atomic weapons testing.  Eligibility under RECA is currently set to expire on July 7, 2022.
The Downwinders Act extends RECA protections for ten additional years, expands eligibility to include individuals in Utah and New Mexico who have been found, through evidence-based data, to have been adversely affected yet have not been eligible for compensation under current law, requires new research from the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Energy to identify if other counties should be provided eligibility, and pays for all costs of the act by auctioning government-owned spectrum.
Sen. Lee also sent a
letter
with Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) to the director of the National Cancer Institute requesting that previously available data on atomic testing radiation exposure again be made accessible to the public.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said,
“The impact of atomic testing on the health of those in Utah and the West has lasted decades.  Downwinders have been seriously harmed by government action, and yet the government still does not recognize many who have been hurt.  This bill commits the federal government to care for these Utahns.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Infrastructure Plan
Date: September 22, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced today his plan to pay less and build more infrastructure.  The bill, titled the Transportation Empowerment Act, would cut taxes and save federal dollars all while allowing more infrastructure to be built.
The proposal focuses federal infrastructure spending on the Interstate Highway System and cuts the federal gas tax from 18.3 cents to 7 cents a gallon and the federal diesel tax from 24.3 cents to 8.3 cents a gallon.  It also covers the Highway Trust Fund’s outstanding obligations and replenishes the depleted fund by transferring $120.2 billion in unspent COVID-19 funds.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said,
“The Federal Government can easily meet its infrastructure obligations and we don’t have to spend trillions of dollars to do it.  By focusing on what is truly federal, we can cut taxes, pay less, and build more.  This bill does just that.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill Protecting Children from Sex Reassignment Research
Date: September 21, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act, a bill prohibiting federal funding of sex-reassignment research on minors.  Medical interventions to reassign sex are experimental, irreversible, and often fail to produce the intended effects of improving patients’ mental health.  This bill would prohibit federal funding from being used in research or publications that seek to establish or affirm gender identities that are incongruent with a minor’s biological sex.
Of the bill,
Sen. Lee
said,
“The Federal Government should never fund research that harms kids.  This bill will protect taxpayers from funding spurious research, but more importantly, it will protect kids from the permanent damage this irresponsible research can produce.”
Sen. Lee is joined by Sens. Mike Braun (R-IN), James Lankford (R-OK), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) as cosponsors.
The following have endorsed the bill:
Terry Schilling, President, American Principles Project
said,
"Most Americans do not want their tax dollars going towards studies that encourage children to undergo experimental, dangerous procedures to 'change' their sex. Yet here in Washington, left-wing ideologues in government seem intent on overruling the people and imposing their extreme ideology on the rest of the country. Thankfully, we still have courageous leaders like Senator Mike Lee willing to stand up to this insanity. APP applauds Sen. Lee for introducing this important legislation, and we urge every senator with an ounce of decency to support this common-sense bill."
Jessica Anderson, Executive Director, Heritage Action for America
said,
“Unproven, irreversible procedures related to gender transitions for children do more harm than good, as research shows that 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria no longer feel distressed by their bodies after puberty. The Left will stop at nothing to remake society, including waging war on our children, which is why Senator Lee’s Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act, which prevents federal funds from being used to support research that preys on confused children, is so important.”
Joseph Kohm, Public Policy Director of Family Policy Alliance
said,
“American taxpayers should only fund sound, unbiased research -- and when studies involve children and center around politically charged issues, these standards become even more imperative. Sadly, several NIH-funded studies fail this basic test: they are clearly biased in support of a fabricated narrative that children experiencing gender dysphoria should begin transition as early as possible. One of the studies even lacks a control group – indicating the researcher’s lack of concern for what happens when a child is not pressured to pursue transition. Senator Lee’s Protecting Our Kids from Harmful Research Act exposes these serious concerns. The public—and especially families with children struggling to identify with their birth sex-- deserves the unbiased truth about such a critical issue. We endorse Senator Lee’s efforts to ensure scientific integrity through his bill.”
Doreen Denny, Vice President of Government Relations, Concerned Women for America LAC
said
, “Under the direction of Dr. Francis Collins, NIH has fueled the promotion of reckless gender experimentation on youth, approving irreversible treatments for children as young as 8. This is not science, it’s medical scandal. Federal research should protect vulnerable children, not be complici
t in subjecting them to irreversible damage in studies pushed by gender activists. No minor has the capacity to give informed consent for the lifelong consequences of taking destructing “gender transition” drugs. CWA has been working to expose this unethical federally-supported research and we applaud Sen. Lee for introducing legislation to stop it.”

Title: Sens. Lee, King’s Made in USA Bill Passes Senate
Date: September 15, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – The United States Senate unanimously passed Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Angus King’s (I-ME) Reinforcing American-Made Products Act which establishes a national standard for products to be labeled “Made in USA” in interstate commerce.  Currently, businesses must navigate conflicting federal and state definitions and regulatory requirements to label products as “Made-in-USA.”  The Federal Trade Commission has an existing national definition of “Made-in-USA” that does not supersede state requirements under current laws.  This bill will simplify and standardize the product labeling and allow countless businesses who already qualify under the federal definition to sell their products as “Made in USA” nationwide.
Of the bill’s passage,
Sen. Lee
said,
“Businesses are proud to make their products in the United States.  The current labeling environment prevents countless businesses and products from receiving the recognition they deserve and consumers want.  This bill makes sure businesses have an incentive to produce here at home.”
Sen. King
said,
“When a consumer sees a ‘Made in the USA’ label, they know they’re purchasing a well-made product and supporting American jobs. These labels are a simple, straightforward way to help consumers make informed decisions – all while supporting American workers and retailers. For too long, a patchwork of confusing differences in state regulations have prevented too many American manufacturers from using the labels, and threatens the economic livelihood of local businesses – but now, we’ve taken an important step toward progress. I’m proud that this bipartisan bill has passed the Senate, and urge the House of Representatives to advance this bill in order to support American-made products and provide clarity for consumers.”
Richard Hendrickson, President and CEO of
Lifetime Products
, a Utah business that makes its products in America, said of the bill,
“We want to mark our products, “Made in USA,” so we roll our own tubing, we then do all the welding, the punching, the painting, the packaging.  And yet, there came a time that we were actually sued for putting “Made in USA” on these basketball hoops.  To not have a consistent definition of “Made in USA” is insensible. Our ability to mark our products “Made in USA” matters.  Senator Lee’s support helps us create jobs, opportunities, and bless families’ lives.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces War Funding Controls
Date: September 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Braun (R-IN) today introduced the Restraining Emergency War Spending Act to place Congressional controls on the use of emergency funding for enduring wars.  Congress has appropriated over $2 Trillion of defense emergency funds over the past two decades with largely amorphous requirements, and the funds have been spent on everything from operations in Afghanistan and Iraq to standard deterrence missions in the European theater.
These reforms would prescribe a statutory definition to classify emergency war spending, and establish a permanent budget point of order against measures that include emergency war spending outside the definition.
Of the bill
Sen. Lee
said,
“
The days of endless wars and trillion-dollar defense slush funds must come to an end.  Congress needs to better control, define, and oversee emergency defense spending to make sure American blood and treasure is not committed and lost needlessly.  This bill will allow Congress to better perform its constitutional roles of overseeing our nation’s defense budget and wars
.”
The bill is endorsed by
National Taxpayers Union
, the
R Street Institute
, the
Project on Government Oversight
,
and
Concerned Veterans for America.
Andrew Lautz of the
National Taxpayers Union
said of the bill,
“National Taxpayers Union applauds Sen. Lee for introducing this new legislation to put guardrails on the future use of off-budget war accounts. As Sen. Lee and NTU have pointed out, the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account morphed from a contingency fund in the immediate years after 9/11 to a slush fund for wasteful projects and programs that couldn’t make it into the military’s regular budget. Though OCO is gone for the upcoming year, Congress must guard against future abuse of off-budget designations like OCO. Sen. Lee’s legislation would give Congress some much-needed muscle against the abuse of war funding.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Tuberville Introduce Bill Requiring Senate Vote for CDC Director
Date: September 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today introduced the Restoring Trust in Public Health Act which would require that nominees for Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) be confirmed by the United States Senate. Recently, the CDC has impacted the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans through its COVID-19 guidelines and eviction moratorium all under directors that have not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Of the bill
Sen. Lee
said,
“The CDC has exerted astonishing power over the everyday lives of millions of Americans without any say from Congress. This bill will ensure that, through the confirmation process, future directors are qualified, honest, and reasonable. Few agencies need such tempered, rational leadership as much as the CDC.”
Sen. Tuberville
said,
“The CDC Director is arguably the most powerful position at HHS that is not subject to Senate confirmation. In the past year and a half during a global pandemic, CDC-issued guidance has impacted every American - without input from Congress. If an individual is going to have such vast and seemingly unchecked power, the CDC Director should be a Senate-confirmed role to ensure the American people get a say in the process and that the individual selected has the temperament and qualifications necessary.”
Sens. Lee and Tuberville are joined by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Mike Braun (R-IN) as cosponsors.

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Advocate for Religious Freedom in SCOTUS Brief
Date: September 10, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and 11 of his Senate colleagues submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court today encouraging the Court to protect religious educational institutions from discrimination in the form of disqualification from certain programs. In the pending case, Carson v. Makin, the Court is considering whether Maine violated religious liberty rights by restricting the use of otherwise generally available student-aid programs to non-religious schools.
Senator Lee said of the brief, “Congress and the Supreme Court have long understood the value of both religious and secular education institutions. Students should not be punished for attending a school where faith is taught, and states should not be able to discriminate against citizens who choose to live and learn their faith in school.”
The brief reads in part, “Since its infancy under the Articles of Confederation, the United States of America has valued education and seen it as an integral part of a free society. To that end, Congress—entrusted with the will of the People—has worked for over two hundred years to increase educational opportunities for Americans.” and continues, “History shows that Congress repeatedly allocated funds to advance education without fear of triggering Establishment Clause concerns.”
Senator Lee is joined in the brief by Senators:
Mitch McConnell, KY
John Cornyn, TX
Ron Johnson, WI
Ted Cruz, TX

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Demand Answers from Biden on Afghanistan Withdrawal
Date: September 2, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and 25 of his senate colleagues sent
a letter
to President Biden demanding information regarding the humanitarian crisis left by the withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan. Specifically, the letter requests information on the number and status of Americans, green-card holders, and allies who were left behind.
The Senators wrote in part, “We write regarding the humanitarian crisis created by your withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan, and the safety and well-being of our fellow countrymen and allies who you left behind. The signatories of this letter may have differing opinions about whether the United States should have maintained a military presence in Afghanistan, but we all agree that the arbitrary and poorly-planned method by which you withdrew from Afghanistan caused this crisis.”
The Senators continued, “We request thorough, unclassified answers to these questions that can be made available to the general public. Americans need to see that the United States will not abandon them to terrorists abroad forever. If your answers implicate classified material, you may also submit a classified appendix to your answers and coordinate with us to provide a classified briefing.”

Title: Senator Lee's Budget Amendment for Increased PILT Passes Senate
Date: August 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a
budget resolution amendment
that carves budgetary space for legislation increasing federal PILT payments to local governments. PILT stands for payments in lieu of taxes, and the program currently pays much less than local governments could collect if federal lands were assessed property tax. Senator Lee’s amendment opens the door for a bill to determine the size of the payment shortfall and bring PILT payments in line with what local governments are due.
The amendment passed the Senate in the
early hours
of Tuesday by a 51-48 margin during the budget resolution vote-a-rama process.

Title: Lee Bill Protects Schools From Critical Race Theory
Date: August 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced the Empowering Local Curriculum Act, a bill to ensure that the receipt of federal education funds does not require the teaching of critical race theory. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) joined as a co-sponsor.
“Critical race theory undermines our founding principles, institutions, social mobility, and history itself – and schools should not be forced to teach it,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will ensure that with the receipt of federal funds, states and local educators will not have to.”
Specifically, the bill would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to clarify that nothing in those Acts require the use, teaching, promotion, or recommendation of any academic discipline, program, or activity that holds anti-American or racist principles.

Title: Sen. Lee Votes Against $1,200,000,000,000 Bill
Date: August 10, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today after voting against H.R. 3684, the $1.2-trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as amended:
“I am sorely disappointed that the Senate chose to pass this irresponsible and so-called ‘infrastructure’ bill. It drastically expands federal power; it increases spending without legitimate ‘pay-fors’; it exacerbates our already dangerous inflation; and it facilitates burdensome taxes and regulations that will hamper and harm our infrastructure. Ultimately, it will be the American people who will be forced to pay the exorbitant price. That is why I opposed this bill, and why I am deeply concerned with the $3,500,000,000,000 cost of the next spending plan before the Senate.”

Title: Senator Lee Introduces More than 100 Amendments to Democrat Budget Bill
Date: August 10, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced today more than 100 amendments to the Democrats’ pending budget bill. The budget without amendments sets the course for Congress to add as much as $5,500,000,000,000 to the nation’s debt over ten years.
Senator Lee’s amendments add to the process known as vote-a-rama which is one of the Senate’s few opportunities to have unlimited amendments on legislation.
Of the amendments Sen. Lee said, “Democrats are committed to spending trillions of dollars we do not have. They are foolishly adding to inflation and taxes and shoving the costs on the American people. My amendments are written to make the federal government work better for Utah and be less of an obstruction in Utahns’ lives.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce “Don’t Draft Our Daughters” Resolution
Date: August 6, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) yesterday introduced a resolution expressing that the Senate should not pass legislation mandating the registration of women for the Selective Service System.
“Forcing our daughters into the draft creates a burdensome and disproportionately increased risk of injury and fatalities for our nation’s women, as readiness data shows,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This policy change is rushed and unnecessary in our current time of peace, and unduly harms women more than advancing any notion of equality. While American women should be empowered to serve in our Armed Forces, they should not be forced to fight.”
“Our all-volunteer military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known,”
said Sen. Lankford
. “Women have shown they are more than capable of fully serving in our Armed Forces, and I commend our brave daughters, sisters, and mothers who serve our nation. There is no reason to add women to the outdated Selective Service System to prepare for a draft. When we have faced national security threats over the past four decades, men and women who love our country have volunteered in massive numbers to protect our nation with great distinction. Women are eligible to serve in any role in our military that they choose, but they should not be compelled to sign up for selective service.”
“Montana has a rich legacy of service that is carried on today by both men and women who voluntarily serve our country,” said
Sen. Daines.
“We do not need to be forcing our nation’s daughters to enter the draft.”
“Women have heroically served in and alongside America’s fighting forces since our nation’s founding. It’s one thing to allow American women to choose this life, it’s quite another to force it upon our daughters, sisters, and wives,” said
Sen. Hawley.
“Missourians feel strongly that compelling women to serve is wrong and so do I.”
Earlier this summer, the Senate Armed Services Committee included in the markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 a provision that would require women to register for the draft.
The draft, in its rare instances of use, primarily serves as a pipeline to replace combat forces. However, data from the Marine Corps demonstrates that injury rates in combat roles are significantly higher for women over men. The Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force found that musculoskeletal injuries were twice as high for women; and research conducted at the Infantry Training Battalion demonstrated an injury rate for enlisted women six times higher than the rate for men.
Additionally, the physical fitness required for combat roles are only achievable for a small percentage of women. Data from Army’s gender-neutral Combat Fitness Test show a fail rate ranging between 65% to 85% for women, compared to 10% to 30% for men.

Title: Senator Lee offers ‘Pay Less, Build More’ Amendment to Infrastructure Bill
Date: August 3, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has put forth an alternative to the “bipartisan infrastructure bill.” Lee’s
amendment #2255
is a combination of the
Transportation Empowerment Act
, the
UNSHACKLE Act
, and the
Davis-Bacon Repeal Act
. The amendment would reduce the federal gas tax by more than eleven cents per gallon, return the national Highway Trust Fund to solvency, speed-up and simplify burdensome National Environmental Policy Act requirements, and remove Davis-Bacon wage rules. Each of these reforms will allow more federal infrastructure projects to be built more quickly and more affordably.
Of the amendment Sen. Lee said, “We cannot pour money into a broken pitcher. Without these reforms, spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure will not only exacerbate inflation, it will not substantially improve our infrastructure standing. The ‘Pay Less, Build More’ Amendment is a way to cut taxes and burdensome regulation to improve our infrastructure standing while spending less.”

Title: Sen. Lee Votes in Favor of National Guard
Date: July 29, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) voted for a measure that would provide funding to the National Guard to satisfy a debt incurred by security services provided post-January 6
th
. Passage of this legislation is aimed at preventing the cancellation of vital training missions planned by National Guards in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without this reimbursement, numerous trainings and drill weekends would be cancelled, resulting in guardsman not receiving pay for those previously scheduled activities.
Following his vote,
Sen. Lee
said,
“The function of Utah’s National Guard is not only vital to the defense and support of Utah, but to the entire nation. When Utah’s sons and daughters reported to Washington, D.C. to protect the Capitol, they did so out of a commitment to duty and patriotism. It is unacceptable that their service would be punished by being denied the necessary funds to carry out additional missions and training. Voting to support the National Guard is a vote to protect and defend the constitution of the United States.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Curtis Introduce Legislation to Rename Provo Vet Center After “Candy Bomber” Gail Halvorsen
Date: July 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) today introduced legislation to rename the Provo Vet Center in Orem, Utah after Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen, the “Candy Bomber.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Reps. Blake Moore (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Chris Stewart (R-UT) joined as cosponsors of the legislation. The delegation also wrote a letter to the Chairman John Tester and Ranking Member Jerry Moran of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in support of the name change.
“Col. Gail Halvorsen exemplifies the best of the Utah spirit of service,”
said Sen. Lee.
“His creativity and compassion helped to heal the wounds of the Second World War, and softened the relationship between occupied Germany and the United States. Renaming the Provo Vet Center in his honor is a fitting and deserved recognition of this American hero.”
“Gail Halvorsen represents all that is good about Utahns—and our men and women in uniform,”
said Rep. Curtis.
“I am proud of our bill to honor his legacy and service to the United States with the soon-to-be renamed, "Gail S. Halvorsen 'Candy Bomber' Veterans Center."
“Col. Gail S. Halvorsen was a force for good and a beacon of hope for many in the aftermath of the Second World War,”
said Sen. Romney.
“What began as a gesture of compassion quickly grew into an official U.S. Air Force operation as he and his fellow pilots dropped candy rations from their planes to the children of West Berlin. Gail is an American hero who exemplifies the best of humanity and embodies our state’s kindness and spirit of service, and it is only fitting that we rename the Provo Vet Center in his honor.”
“Col. Gail S. Halvorsen is a Utah veteran and an American hero,”
said Rep. Owens.
“He embodies our state's spirit of service, faith, and community, and I'm proud to join this united effort to honor him and his family in a way that will continue his extraordinary legacy.”
“Gail Halverson embodies the ideals that Utahns, and all Americans, strive for every day: Bravery, compassion, and service. As a fellow Air Force veteran myself, I can think of none more fitting to represent the Veteran Center in Provo. I am proud to stand among a united Utah delegation in honoring his legacy,”
said Rep. Stewart.
“Colonel Gail Halvorsen epitomizes Utah’s humanitarian spirit,”
said Rep. Moore.
“As an ambassador of the American Armed Forces, he provided more than candy. He brought hope to a German nation suffering from the wrath and destruction of the Second World War. No one is more deserving of our gratitude than Gail, and I am proud to join my colleagues in honoring his compassion and creativity.”
Col. Halvorsen performed military service of an extraordinary character during the Berlin Airlift in 1948, dropping candy rations from his plane to destitute German children as he undertook his airlift missions. An estimated 250,000 parachutes with 21 tons of candy were dropped by Halvorsen and his fellow airmen to the starving children of Berlin as part of “Operation Little Vittles.”
After 31 years of service and more than 8,000 hours of flying time, Col. Halvorsen retired from the military in 1974. Since then, he has continued engaging in humanitarian and community service, representing the U.S. Airforce abroad and re-enacting his famous candy drops in Berlin, the Middle East, and around the world in an effort to bring peace and relief. He has been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, a German Order of Merit, an Air Force Commendation Medal, and a Medal for Humane Action. He has also founded the Gail S. Halvorsen Aviation Education Foundation, which advances aviation and STEM education, promotes youth leadership development, and encourages humanitarian service.
The bill would rename the Provo Vet Center to “The Col. Gail S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center.”

Title: Senator Lee Rejects New Irresponsible Infrastructure Spending
Date: July 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) voted against the motion to proceed to the $1.2-trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act today. The full text of the large bill and Congressional Budget Office Score have yet to be released.
Of new spending amidst growing inflationary pressures and mounting federal debt,
Sen. Lee
said, “We are already seeing skyrocketing costs for things we need every day. Housing, food, gasoline, and electricity are all becoming more expensive in large part because the federal government keeps spending more money than it has. This inflation is making it harder to make ends meet and provide for our families. This spending risks our children’s future, but we are also feeling the costs now.
“What our state needs is for the federal government to get out of the way and let Utahns do what we do best – work hard and care for our families.”

Title: Sen. Lee Urges FTC To Change Course
Date: July 27, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan expressing concerns regarding several recent developments at the agency.
In particular, Sen. Lee expressed concern at the agency’s continued refusal to grant early terminations of the waiting period for mergers that pose no threat to competition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act; moves to diminish the role of minority Commissioners; allowing public input only
after
the Commission has voted on the issues at hand; and the agency’s preparation to issue second requests unless the merging parties convince it not do so, a “guilty-until-proven-innocent” approach to law enforcement.
Sen. Lee said in part,
“
The unifying theme of these developments is a progressive putsch to consolidate power and burden American businesses. For the sake of our antitrust enforcement regime, competitive markets, and the American economy, I hope you will change course.”
Read the full text of the letter
HERE
and below.
July 27, 2021
The Honorable Lina Khan Chairwoman
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairwoman Khan:
I write to share a number of concerns with recent developments at the Federal Trade Commission.
First, I would direct you to my May 18 letter to then-Acting Chairwoman Slaughter in which I expressed my alarm at the FTC’s continued refusal to grant early termination of the HSR waiting period for mergers that pose no competitive threat. I urge you to rescind the suspension and return to this longstanding, good-government practice. As I wrote in that letter, “it is an appalling abuse of regulatory discretion to require businesses to wait out the entire 30-day period for no benefit to either competition or consumers. The blanket refusal to grant early termination in any instance is nothing more than a tax on American entrepreneurs trying to fuel our economic recovery.”
Second, I am also concerned by your moves to diminish the role of minority Commissioners. As I also wrote in my May letter, “The bipartisan collegiality of the Federal Trade Commission has long been regarded as one of its best weapons.” From just the first month of your tenure, it has become clear that you view this bipartisan collegiality as an impediment rather than an asset. By pre-approving broad investigatory authorizations, as opposed to considering the merits of individual investigations, and allowing just a single commissioner to approve the use of compulsory process, the FTC has chosen to avoid bipartisan input and accountability until the very end of the investigative process when filing a complaint. If the FTC is going to approach antitrust enforcement like the Antitrust Division, that is all the more reason to consolidate the two agencies at the Department of Justice.
Third, the FTC is projecting a false sense of concern for public input as it undertakes this radical alteration to how the Commission operates. While I commend the use of public meetings to give citizens more insight into what the Commission is doing and how Commissioners view these important issues, it is cold comfort to allow public input only
after
the Commission has voted on the issues at hand. It is akin to allowing a defendant to testify only after the verdict has been rendered—the exact opposite of the rule of law.
Finally, I was shocked to read in a recent article that the FTC “is preparing to issue [] second requests unless the merging parties convince it not to do so.”
This guilty-until-proven-innocent approach to law enforcement, in addition to being nothing short of prosecutorial harassment, is unacceptable in a constitutional republic. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act was implemented to give antitrust enforcers the ability to stop anticompetitive mergers before they are consummated, not to impose regulatory burdens on
all
mergers or allow the agencies to invert the burden of proof in merger cases. Second requests are an essential tool to protect consumers, but they can also be extremely burdensome and expensive to comply with. For deals that pose no risk to competition, such an unexpected cost and delay could sink the deal entirely. Congress has not granted the antitrust enforcement agencies the power or discretion to impose such a policy.
If the FTC is indeed taking this approach, there is also a dangerous chance that it could backfire. Second requests are rarely if ever litigated, but parties would be right to do so where there are no competitive concerns. The HSR Act allows parties to object to second requests that are “unreasonably cumulative, unduly burdensome, or duplicative.”
The FTC may soon find itself on the losing end of such a case, potentially permanently diminishing the agency’s ability to investigate mergers before consummation.
The unifying theme of these developments is a progressive putsch to consolidate power and burden American businesses. For the sake of our antitrust enforcement regime, competitive markets, and the American economy, I hope you will change course.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) launched his new website at Lee.Senate.gov. The new site features a Spanish version, a streamlined design, easier access to information, and an improved constituent comment system. For years, Sen. Lee’s website has helped constituents communicate with Sen. Lee, schedule meetings and tours, learn about his background and policy stances, and stay up-to-date on his efforts to serve the people of Utah.

Title: Sen. Lee Speaks Against Runaway Spending
Date: July 22, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – In response to recent spending proposals and the historically high federal deficit and debt, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke against uncontrolled federal spending.
Sen. Lee said, “For a long time, I and others have talked about how this will affect our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren down the road. And this will be a real consequence: They will in fact be saddled with debt they have not incurred, and forced to pay for it. The consequences, however, are no longer something we are facing in the distant future – but also what we are facing today. They’ve caught up to us. … I vote ‘no’ when I see how the consequences will affect those I represent in real, everyday life – not just the intended consequences of legislation that might indeed have a good goal, but the unintended consequences also. I vote ‘no’ if it will mean saying ‘yes’ to what really matters, what really counts, for making everyday life better for Utahns and hardworking Americans across the country.” Sen. Lee continued, “It will be little comfort to the poor and middle class who feel the buying power of their paycheck shrink each week, that politicians can vote ‘yes’ on large spending packages for short-term political gain.”

Title: IRS Changes Course after Sen. Lee and Rep. Owens Send Letter on Religious Liberty
Date: July 8, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – After a June letter to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sent by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT) and colleagues, the IRS reversed course on a determination removing tax-exempt status of a religious values group. The letter called out the IRS determination that “the sanctity of life, biblical marriage, and biblical justice” were associated with political party platforms.
Of the letter,
Sen. Lee
said, “
I am glad to see that after receiving our letter, the IRS reversed course on what would have been a dangerous and discriminatory decision. Religious groups must be free to teach their beliefs without fear of government retaliation.
”
Rep. Owens
said, “
With this politically motivated and discriminatory decision, the IRS contradicted itself and alienated Americans of faith. Religious prejudice should never be tolerated, especially from our federal institutions. I’m glad to see this biased determination reviewed and corrected.
”
The letter read in part:
“We write today to express extreme concern regarding a recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determination on the tax-exempt status of Christians Engaged, a nonprofit organization located in Texas. We urge you to personally review this determination, and remove the individual, or individuals, responsible for the blatantly biased, discriminatory, and flawed reasoning that led to the determination.
“Mr. Martin also takes offense to Christians Engaged’s teachings regarding “freedom of speech, defense, … borders and immigration, [and] U.S. and Israel relations.” Millions of Americans draw deeply from their religious beliefs to inform how they vote and many religious organizations conduct get out the vote efforts. In fact, President Biden himself campaigned alongside church leaders during the 2020 presidential race.
“The IRS must objectively analyze applications for tax-exempt status and cannot allow political biases to creep into its decisions. We urge you to immediately review Christians Engaged’s application for 501(c)(3) status personally, and terminate the IRS staff involved in the flawed and politically motivated reasoning behind the determination.”

Title: Sen. Lee Expresses Concerns about Possible Revocation of FTC 2015 Statement of Section 5 Enforcement Principles
Date: June 24, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today issued the following statement in response to an announcement that the Federal Trade Commission will meet to consider rescinding its 2015 Statement of Enforcement Principles Regarding Unfair Methods of Competition Under Section 5 of the FTC Act:
“I am disappointed to see Chairwoman Khan already moving to undo an important, bipartisan antitrust policy agreement. The FTC’s 2015 statement regarding unfair methods of competition received support from all three Democratic commissioners at the time, and marked a long-overdue step forward to clarify the scope of the Commission’s authority and the priority of consumer welfare in the application of the antitrust laws. Should the FTC rescind the statement, it will replace clarity with ambiguity in the midst of a fragile economic recovery. Rescinding the statement would also signal that the Commission rejects the idea that there are any limits to its power or regulatory reach, and that it intends to use Section 5 to address non-economic harms outside the agency’s purview or expertise.
“As I have noted many times, there is bipartisan interest in reforming antitrust law and combating anticompetitive monopolies. That bipartisan interest should result in bipartisan solutions. Revoking the bipartisan Section 5 Statement would undermine that effort, and potentially lead to antitrust enforcement that is divorced from the interests of consumers.
“I am also worried that this is just the beginning of a troubling trend of partisan antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration. This worry was exacerbated when President Biden nominated Ms. Khan to be a commissioner and withheld his intention to immediately name her as Chairwoman. This was undoubtedly an attempt to evade the greater scrutiny and vetting that comes with the confirmation process for the Chair of a Commission, as opposed to an individual commissioner. It is ironic that this kind of deception was used to install leadership at the federal agency tasked with fighting deception and fraud.
“I remain committed to protecting consumers and competition, and to doing so on a bipartisan basis. I hope the Biden Administration will correct course and join that effort.”

Title: Sen. Lee Speaks on Ending Federal Mask Mandate
Date: June 23, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor in support of Sen. Rick’s Scott’s (R-FL) Stop Mandating Additional Requirements for Travel (SMART) Act, and to ask for its passage by unanimous consent. Though Democrats blocked its passage, the SMART Act would prohibit the federal government from requiring Americans to wear masks on public transportation.
“The CDC’s requirement that vaccinated individuals wear masks on public transportation is no longer defensible, as it blatantly contradicts the agency’s own policies and research,”
said Sen. Lee.
“With the vaccine now free and widely available, Americans should be able to choose for themselves whether to receive it, whether to wear a mask, or whether to take their own precautions – free of mandates imposed by the government.”
Senator Rick Scott
said,
“While we choose to listen to the science, all the Democrats care about is following their political science. The CDC itself has been clear mask mandates aren’t needed. So, why is the CDC singling out airlines and public transportation? It doesn’t make sense. Just like the federal government should not be in the business of requiring Americans to turn over their vaccination records, the federal government should not be mandating citizens wear masks on public transportation. Americans should be free to make choices they feel are in the best interest of their own health and the health of their loved ones. We have to listen to the science and work together to move America forward.”

Title: Sen. Lee Delivers Remarks on U.S.-U.K. Free Trade Resolution
Date: June 16, 2021

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) yesterday delivered remarks on the Senate floor on his resolution declaring the importance of the U.S.-U.K. “special relationship,” and the prime opportunity of reaching a free trade agreement between the two nations.
Sen. Lee said in part:
“The U.K. has been one of our staunchest and most loyal allies. We have stood beside each other through two world wars and the Cold War. In the 21
st
century, the U.S. and the U.K. have become even stronger friends and partners, both in the fight against global terrorism and for freedom, peace, and prosperity.
Now, an opportunity lies before us to strengthen this relationship more than ever before: by securing a free trade agreement between our two nations, which is the purpose of the resolution before us today.”

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Native Species Protection Act
Date: June 15, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Native Species Protection Act Tuesday, a bill that would allow states to manage species that exist entirely within their border.
“There are real benefits to protecting endangered species from extinction, but the federal law intended to establish such protections – the Endangered Species Act – is in serious need of reform,”
Sen. Lee said.
“The Native Species Protection Act is a commonsense reform that would limit the damage caused by federal mismanagement of protected species and their habitats, while empowering state and local officials to pursue sensible conservation plans with their communities.”
The Native Species Protection Act clarifies that noncommercial species found entirely within the borders of a single state are not subject to regulation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 or any other provision of law enacted as an exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
Cosponsors of the bill include Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley Introduce TEAM Act to Reform Antitrust Law
Date: June 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today introduced the Tougher Enforcement Against Monopolies, or TEAM Act, to reform our nation’s antitrust laws.
“America is facing a panoply of competition concerns not just in Big Tech, but across our entire economy,”
said Sen Lee.
“We need a holistic approach that deals with all of these concerns, and that benefits all consumers, in every industry – without massively increasing regulation and imposing a command-and-control grip over the economy. The TEAM Act strikes the right balance in protecting competition and consumer welfare while limiting government intervention in our free market economy.”
“Anticompetitive and monopolistic business practices hurt innovation and consumers. This bill streamlines and strengthens antitrust enforcement and holds bad actors accountable for their anticompetitive actions while preserving a free market,”
Sen. Grassley said.
The TEAM Act, in addition to consolidating our antitrust enforcement agencies into one, streamlined agency, strengthens our ability to prevent and correct antitrust harm in three main ways:
The TEAM Act strengthens antitrust laws
. It includes a market share-based merger presumption, improves the HSR Act, codifies the consumer welfare standard, and makes it harder for monopolists to justify or excuse anticompetitive conduct.
The TEAM Act strengthens antitrust enforcers.
In addition to consolidating federal antitrust enforcement at the Department of Justice, the bill also includes a version of the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, introduced by Senators Klobuchar and Grassley. And most significantly, the bill roughly
doubles
the amount of money appropriated to federal antitrust enforcement, ensuring that our antitrust enforcers have all of the resources they need to protect American consumers.
The TEAM Act strengthens antitrust remedies
. The bill repeals
Illinois Brick
and
Hanover Shoe
, to ensure that consumers are able to recover damages from anticompetitive conduct. Even more significantly, the bill allows the Justice Department to recover trebled damages on behalf of consumers, and imposes civil fines for knowingly violating the antitrust laws.

Title: Sens. Lee, King, and Paul Introduce PRIME Act
Date: June 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON –
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is happy to join Sens. Angus King (I-ME) and Rand Paul (R-KY) in introducing the
Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption (PRIME) Act
.  In addition to reviving the ability of local custom slaughterhouses to compete with large regional packers, this commonsense legislation moves to revive the ability of individual states to govern the commerce within their own borders.
“Current federal laws and regulations—designed for large regional packers—create insurmountable economic barriers that keep local outfits from competing in the market,”
said Sen. Lee.
“By removing some of those barriers, local meat processers can rejoin local markets, processing backlogs can be alleviated, and meat prices at the local grocery store can stabilize.”
The legislation comes days after a ransomware attack forced the world’s largest meat processor to shut down nine U.S. plants and disrupted production at other facilities—reinforcing the importance of local producers in a resilient food supply chain.
Under current law, farmers and ranchers must have their animals processed at a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified facility to sell their product commercially.  However, the limited availability of these facilities—which end up being large corporate entities that can afford to pay for USDA inspectors—can create enormous problems for the food supply chain, with the most burdensome impacts on farmers, ranchers, and grocery store customers.
The PRIME Act would exempt custom packers from the economic burden of the USDA inspection process, would shift more safety oversight to states—some of which already have equally rigorous inspection practices—and would break down barriers for small farms looking to sell their product in-state.  This rebalance of power will help relieve the significant shortage of processing capacity while allowing small farms, ranchers, and slaughterhouses to thrive.  By restoring the role of state government over intrastate commerce in this way, we will make it easier for farmers to supply their products to markets, restaurants, and grocery stores in their own state, which will give consumers more, and likely cheaper, options to access farm-fresh products.

Content:
WASHINGTON – Following ProPublica’s publication of a “vast trove” of taxpayer information provided to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that appears to be confidential information and protected under federal law from disclosure, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Ron Johnson (R-WI) have sent letters to the Acting Treasury Inspector General and the Inspector General for Tax Administration to request a prompt investigation into how this IRS information was lost and to hold accountable any individuals who broke federal law by inappropriately sharing confidential tax information.
“
Taxpayers must have the utmost confidence in federal institutions that house their personal and confidential information,”
the senators write in the letter.
“Regrettably, American citizens have reason to be distrusting, having witnessed IRS personnel weaponize information in recent years for the purpose of targeting certain tax-exempt organizations for political reasons during the Obama Administration.
“Regrettably, it appears personnel with access to American’s personal and confidential information are again misusing protected information for political reasons. Treasury and the IRS must hold accountable any and all individuals who broke federal law by inappropriately sharing the confidential tax information and tax returns of multiple Americans.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee today issued the following statement on his vote opposing legislation to create a commission investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol:
“The events of January 6th were tragic, and there are many legitimate questions that remain to be answered. However, the commission the Democrats attempted to establish today contained broad investigative mandates even to areas outside the events of January 6th, combined with broad subpoena power and a flawed structure – constituting a recipe for a political witch-hunt. I support efforts, including the multiple investigations underway and the oversight from Senate Committees, to uncover these unanswered questions, but establishing a Kangaroo Commission to politicize the events of that day will neither help us deliver justice nor get to the bottom of the truth.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today issued the following statement as Google nears a settlement of an antitrust case with France alleging that the company has abused its power in online advertising.
“Like many Americans across the political spectrum, I have been concerned by the exercise of market power held by Google and other tech giants, which is why I chaired a hearing on Google’s conduct in digital advertising last fall. As we heard in the hearing, Google appears to have a commanding share of every piece of the online advertising market, and appears to be using its leading market positions in search and online video to engage in tying on the advertiser side of its business, essentially forcing the vast majority of demand onto its platform. I’m pleased to see that France has made headway in securing fair competition in online advertising, and hope that Americans soon receive the same benefits of competition as the French.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Introduce Bill to Empower State Antitrust Enforcers
Date: May 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) yesterday introduced the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021, a bill to ensure state attorneys general are able to remain in the court they select rather than having their cases moved to a court the defendant prefers. Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) has introduced companion legislation in the House.
Under current law, antitrust enforcement actions filed by the United States cannot be transferred via a process run by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML). This carveout from the JPML process ensures that the United States gets to remain in the court it selected and guarantees the United States retains its homefield advantage in the litigation. It also ensures the United States’ litigation moves quickly because it is not able to be combined with any similar case brought by private plaintiffs, which traditionally runs much more slowly because of the various competing interests in the litigation.
Conversely, states that file antitrust cases under the federal antitrust laws do not get this same benefit. They are subject to the JPML process and therefore they do not get to remain in their chosen court, resulting in serious delays in their cases and additional injuries to the citizens of their states.
“Federal antitrust enforcers already benefit from protection against delays or threats from private antitrust suits, and there is no reason that state attorneys general should not receive this same protection,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will strengthen federalism by putting state antitrust enforcers on an equal footing.”
“America works best when competition prevails, and consumers across the country benefit from the efforts of state authorities to enforce our nation’s antitrust laws,”
said Sen. Klobuchar.
“This bipartisan legislation will allow for more efficient and more effective antitrust enforcement by state attorneys general, which is good for competition and consumers.”
“States play a critical role in enforcing federal antitrust laws and should have the same benefit that is already afforded to federal antitrust enforcers – to select and remain in their preferred venue. Through this legislation, many of the inefficiencies and obstacles the states face in enforcing the federal antitrust laws will be eliminated, resulting in quicker resolution for the citizens of those states,”
Rep. Buck said.

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Cloud Request Debt Servicing Costs
Date: May 21, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON –
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) today led
34
of their colleagues in sending a bicameral, bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Budget Committees requesting that they direct the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to begin including debt servicing costs whenever they produce an official cost estimate. The letter also highlights the high interest costs of deficit spending, especially in light of emerging inflation threats.
The letter reads in part:
“Our nation’s outstanding public debt recently surpassed $28 trillion, as reported by the Treasury Department on May 10, 2021. It was only a year and a half ago that the U.S.’s outstanding public debt reached $23 trillion. Those numbers are in fact, troubling, but the amount that we are spending just to service that debt, is also alarming. In Fiscal Year 2020, net outlays for interest totaled $345 billion or 5.3 percent of total spending, according to the CBO. While CBO estimates that historically low interest rates are keeping net interest outlays low, that could dramatically change and impact our nation’s spending in key areas.
“In fact, that change may come sooner than CBO expected. On May 12, 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that inflation had grown by 4.2 percent over the last year, ‘the largest 12-month increase since…September 2008.’ Well before the inflation announcement was made, CBO had been estimating that net interest costs ‘would exceed other mandatory spending by 2030, exceed all discretionary spending by 2043 and surpass spending for Social Security by 2045.’ If such inflation is sustained, interest rates will rise and rapidly advance the timeline in which debt servicing eclipses all other spending. This data should cause Congress serious concern over our total spending, as well as the spending associated with servicing that debt.”

Title: Lee, Tuberville Introduce the CHOICE Act
Date: May 20, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON –
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) today introduced the Children Have Opportunities in Classrooms Everywhere Act, or CHOICE Act, a bill to allow low-income families with children in grades K-12 to use federal education funds for educational options that best fit their needs.
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to create opportunities for low-income students by providing funding that would increase “quality and equality” in education and is the main source of federal aid for K-12 education. However, ESEA dollars go through a formulaic maze that siphons off money to bureaucracy and administrative costs, without any consideration for children’s individual needs, parental input, and accountability for schools. Decades’ worth of evidence has shown that the ESEA has made little to no progress in improving the academic outcomes or opportunities for the low-income children it’s intended to serve.
The CHOICE Act would allow low-income families with children in grades K-12 to apply for federal education funds that they can choose to put towards the public school in which their children are enrolled; or towards an education savings account, known as 529 account. Additionally, it would expand the qualified expenses for 529 accounts so that they could go towards private school tuition, virtual learning, tutoring, homeschooling curriculums, therapy services, and more.
“For far too long, our K-12 funds have gone towards a bureaucratic system that excludes parents and leaves low-income students behind,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will ensure that our K-12 funds go directly to families and students, so that they are empowered to choose options that best meet their unique needs.”
“I spent the past 40 years traveling to high schools around the country and talking to students about their next steps after graduation,”
said
Sen. Tuberville.
“A four year college is not for everyone, but an opportunity is. The CHOICE Act provides students with an opportunity, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, by giving parents a choice in what educational opportunities and programs will best prepare their student for a life and career after K-12 schooling. By letting parents and students decide what is best for them, our education system is working the way it should be – equipping students with skills to succeed.”
Outside organizations supporting the bill include the American Federation for Children and Heritage Action for America.
"The pandemic illustrated the critical problem with K-12 education in America - putting the interests of the teachers' unions ahead of individual families and students. Education funding is meant for educating children, not for protecting a particular institution. This bill directly empowers lower income families by funding students, not systems. We thank Sen. Lee for introducing this bill."
- John Schilling, President, the American Federation for Children
"For years, many working-class families have had no choice but to send their children to whatever public school they have been zoned for, regardless of the quality of education it provides. The past year has magnified this problem, as the Biden Administration and other Democrats have refused to open schools, choosing to follow teachers unions instead of science, preventing millions of students from returning to school in person. Senator Lee’s CHOICE Act puts these students first by giving them the opportunity to decide what education option works best for them."

Title: Sen. Lee Urges Education Department to Reject Critical Race Theory
Date: May 19, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) this week submitted a formal comment in response to the Department of Education’s proposed priorities for American History and Civics education. The comment reads in part:
“
We have seen in recent years what happens when we indulge the cultural fragmentation of our national community. The critical race theory that undergirds the Department’s proposal does not celebrate diversity; it weaponizes diversity. It casts aside our national identity, instead sharpening hyphenated racial identities into knives and daggers as a means to cancel anyone daring to recognize the underlying reality behind the history of this country. While we are not without our mistakes as a nation, we have consistently sought to improve our society, so that
all
men and women – regardless of age, race, or religion – can flourish. It is dangerous for the federal government to knowingly support ideals and principles that pull us further apart, rather than those that bring us closer together.”

and below.
The Honorable Miguel Cardona
U.S. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue SW
Washington, DC 20202
May 17, 2021
I am writing to express my deep concerns with the proposed priorities of the Department of Education (Department) for the American History and Civics Education programs, including the Presidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics and National Activities programs, Assistance Listing Numbers 84.422A and 84.422B. The federal government should have no role in the creation of an American history and civics curriculum for K-12 education, and this very proposal is evidence of why the involvement of federal bureaucrats in education is misguided.
Of grave concern to me is the use of the undefined term “equity” in education. Last year, now-Vice President Kamala Harris recognized that “equity” is different than equality and suggested that equality means “everyone should get the same amount,” whereas equity is “about giving people the resources and the support they need, so that everyone can be on equal footing, and then compete on equal footing. Equitable treatment means we all end up in the same place.” The Department’s proposal suggests that America is a systemically racist nation and seeks to divide the nation based upon race and identity. But doing so inappropriately emphasizes our differences and undermines what unites us as Americans.
Imposing a standard of equity violates the constitutional ideal of equality as well as the ideals expressed in existing civil rights law that demand equal protection regardless of a person’s “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Further, a standard of equity caters to the divisive and detrimental idea Ibram X. Kendi espoused when he wrote that “the only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.” If pursued, the Department’s proposed standard will undermine the American principle of equality that has led to significant progress in our nation, such as the abolition of slavery, the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more.
Additionally, this proposal seeks to provide federal bureaucrats with the ability to control educational curriculum and digital media consumption, giving unelected and unaccountable individuals the ability to determine what constitutes “misinformation.” This is alarming because instead of allowing well-meaning Americans to deliberate amongst themselves about the accuracy of recorded historical events, federal bureaucrats have chosen to seize control of the narrative, endorsing revisionist history and propaganda campaigns such as the New York Times “1619 Project.” As one scholar put it, this project is “riddled with factual errors.”
We have seen in recent years what happens when we indulge the cultural fragmentation of our national community. The critical race theory that undergirds the Department’s proposal does not celebrate diversity; it weaponizes diversity. It casts aside our national identity, instead sharpening hyphenated racial identities into knives and daggers as a means to cancel anyone daring to recognize the underlying reality behind the history of this country. While we are not without our mistakes as a nation, we have consistently sought to improve our society, so that all men and women – regardless of age, race, or religion – can flourish. It is dangerous for the federal government to knowingly support ideals and principles that pull us further apart, rather than those that bring us closer together.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Act
Date: May 19, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act Tuesday, a bill that would empower local managers of wilderness areas to decide whether to allow and how to regulate non-motorized travel in wilderness areas.
“The National Wilderness Preservation System was created so that the American people could enjoy our country’s priceless natural areas,”
Sen. Lee said.
“This bill would enrich Americans’ enjoyment of the outdoors by expanding recreational opportunities in wilderness areas.”
The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibits the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, motorboats, and other forms of mechanical transport. Current Department of Interior policy considers non-motorized mountain bikes, strollers, and game carts to be “mechanical transport.”
This bill would insert language to the Wilderness Act to ensure that the rules restricting “mechanical transport” do not include forms of nonmotorized travel in which the sole propulsive power is one or more persons.
Additionally, the bill would grant local officials the authority to determine whether, where, and when to allow permissible forms of nonmotorized travel over particular trails.

Title: Sen. Lee Questions FTC on Merger Mismanagement
Date: May 18, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today sent a letter to Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter regarding recent developments in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) handling of merger enforcement. The Senator expressed concerns about the agency’s handling of 7-Eleven’s recent acquisition of Speedway, as well as the FTC’s February decision to suspend granting early termination under the Hart-Scott-Rodino ("HSR") Act. Under the Act, parties to certain mergers and acquisitions must submit premerger notification filings known as HSR filings, and wait up to 30 days before consummating the transaction.
The letter reads in part:
“I was alarmed to read the public statements from you and Commissioner Chopra, Commissioners Phillips and Wilson, and from 7-Eleven regarding 7-Eleven’s acquisition of Speedway. Despite the fact that all four FTC commissioners agree that the acquisition presents serious competitive concerns—and the merging parties’ and FTC staff’s extensive efforts to resolve those concerns—the Commission took no action to prevent or remedy the harm to consumers.”
The letter continues:
“… it is an appalling abuse of regulatory discretion to require businesses to wait out the entire 30-day period for no benefit to either competition or consumers. The blanket refusal to grant early termination in any instance is nothing more than a tax on American entrepreneurs trying to fuel our economic recovery.”
…
I hope you give both of these concerns thoughtful consideration. I will be asking Sen. Klobuchar to request nonpublic briefings from FTC staff on each of these issues so that we can get to the bottom of these troubling developments. Consumers deserve better, and Congress must make sure they get it.”

Title: Lee, McClintock Introduce Bill to Repeal Jones Act
Date: May 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) have introduced the Open America’s Water Act, a bill that would repeal the Jones Act and allow all qualified vessels to engage in domestic trade between U.S. ports.
“Restricting trade between U.S. ports is a huge loss for American consumers and producers,”
said Sen. Lee.
“It is long past time to repeal the Jones Act entirely so that Alaskans, Hawaiians, and Puerto Ricans aren’t forced to pay higher prices for imported goods—and so they rapidly receive the help they need in the wake of natural disasters.”
“The Jones Act is a protectionist law that drives up the cost of commerce, and those costs ultimately fall on the consumer,”
said Rep. McClintock.
“ Just this week, the Jones Act had to be waived to ensure the East Coast had an adequate fuel supply, much like it is often waived to respond to natural disasters in U.S. territories.  The solution is not selective waivers in times of distress – it’s repealing this disastrous law altogether.”
In 1920, Congress passed the Jones Act, which requires all goods transported by water between U.S. ports to be carried on vessels constructed, registered, owned, and crewed primarily by U.S. citizens. This imposes significant costs on American consumers and businesses, especially those in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, which rely on import commodities from the continental U.S.
The Cato Institute estimates that after accounting for the inflated costs of transportation and infrastructure, the forgone wages and output, the lost domestic and foreign business revenue, and the monetized environmental toll, the annual cost of the Jones Act is in the tens of billions of dollars.
Additionally, the Jones Act makes it more difficult to provide relief supplies in the aftermath of natural disasters. As a result, presidents have routinely waived the Jones Act in the wake of natural disasters, as they have done after Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, and Maria.
Sen. Lee previously introduced a version of this
legislation
in 2019.

Title: Lee, Good Introduce Resolution Recognizing “National Pregnancy Center Week”
Date: May 12, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced a resolution designating the week of November 8 as “National Pregnancy Center Week” and recognizing the vital work of pregnancy centers across the United States. The resolution is co-sponsored by 17 of his colleagues, and Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) has sponsored companion legislation in the House.
“Each year, thousands of women and men facing difficult pregnancy situations turn to these centers for help, hope, and healing,”
said Sen. Lee.
“Thanks to the heroic and tireless efforts of their staff and volunteers, parents receive compassionate care and crucial resources that help them to choose life, saving millions of babies’ lives each year. It’s only right that we honor and support their life-affirming work.”
“Pregnancy Centers provide mothers a safe place to turn to as they look for help, hope, and healing during challenging times,”
said Rep. Good. “
These centers and the individuals who work and volunteer at them deserve to be supported and recognized for the vital role they play in helping mothers and their families.  I’m proud to stand with leaders like Senator Mike Lee who are working to protect innocent life.”
In addition to designating the week of November 8 as "National Pregnancy Center Week," the resolution also notes that:
Nonprofit organizations have been cooperating since November 13, 1971 to save as many lives as possible from abortion;
There are approximately 2,700 pregnancy centers in the United States;
Pregnancy centers serve almost 2 million people each year, providing pregnancy tests, ultrasound and medical services, counseling, and education;
Every day in the United States pregnancy centers assist an average of 5,500 people;
More than 2,130 medical pregnancy centers provide ultrasound services at little or no cost;
More than 476,00 ultrasounds are performed at pregnancy centers each year;
Nearly every pregnancy center care and resource center provides clients with material support for pregnancy and infant care, including clothing, furniture, housing assistance, and nutritional resources.
The full list of co-sponsors includes: Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), James Risch (R-ID), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Rick Scott (FL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Braun (R-ID), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA).
Support from outside groups includes: the Susan B. Anthony List, March for Life Action, American Principles Project, Concerned for Women for America Legislative Action Coalition, and Heartbeat International.
“We commend Senator Lee and Representative Good for highlighting the vital contributions of the network of more than 2,700 pro-life pregnancy centers across our country. Groups like Care Net, Heartbeat International, NIFLA, and others, with their multitude of dedicated volunteers, make a powerful positive impact in the lives of millions of women and families – giving them the courage and support they need to choose life. Their heroic service is an area where all Americans, whether or not they consider themselves pro-life, can find common ground. We hope the whole Congress will join us in taking concrete steps to recognize how the pregnancy care center movement continues to stand the test of time.”

Title: Lee, Buck Question Amazon’s Influence on JEDI Contract Procurement Process
Date: May 4, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) today sent letters to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the Acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense Sean O’Donnell regarding whether Amazon violated antitrust or ethics laws by attempting to influence the procurement process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (“JEDI”) contract for cloud computing services for the Department of Defense. A potential 10-year, $10 billion contract to support warfighter operations across the department, it is the largest government cloud contract to a single contractor in history.
In their letter to Amazon, the congressmen wrote in part:
“We are writing regarding potentially corrupt and anticompetitive conduct by Amazon Web Services, Inc. (‘AWS’) that may have violated federal conflict of interest and antitrust laws. Specifically, we are concerned that Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets relating to government and/or commercial cloud computing services by improperly influencing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process.”
In addition to questioning Amazon on their involvement in the process, the congressmen asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation into the procurement process, and the Department of Defense to provide the full investigative file compiled by the Office of Inspector General that found conflicts of interest within the procurement:
“We have recently reviewed the Department of Defense (‘DoD’) Office of the Inspector General (‘DoD IG’) report on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud Procurement (‘Report’). The DoD IG was tasked with investigating the extent to which illegal and undisclosed conflicts of interest on the part of senior DoD officials impacted the JEDI procurement.
“Based on our reading of the Report, it seems that the DoD IG investigation confirmed the existence of these conflicts, and more. Further, facts contained in numerous press stories regarding the procurement are largely or entirely confirmed by the Report. Conflicted officials clearly and repeatedly advocated on behalf of their former client to secure for it one of DoD’s largest and most important information technology contracts.”

Title: Sen. Lee Responds to Biden’s Address to Congress
Date: April 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered the following in response to President Biden’s address to the joint session of Congress:
Tonight, we heard from President Biden on his accomplishments in his first 100 days in office, and on his vision for our country going forward.
It’s been a telling 100 days and a telling evening – though not perhaps in the way that President Biden has presented them to Utahns.
While President Biden campaigned as a centrist and a moderate, he has governed as anything but.
Consider a few of his main “accomplishments” thus far.
In less than 6 months in office, he’s issued 40 executive orders, including:
Halting new oil and gas leases on public lands. That’s a crippling blow to the countless Utahns who depend on those leases for their livelihoods.
Canceling the Keystone Pipeline, with 1,000 jobs lost and 10,000 more that won’t be created.
Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement.
Reimplementing a Catch-and-Release program, halting immigration enforcement, and ending the Remain in Mexico program and our asylum agreements with the northern triangle countries – creating huge surges of migrants and the now massive crisis on the border.
He’s passed a “COVID relief” bill spending $1.9 trillion – with only 9% going towards public health, and the rest going towards a partisan, progressive wish list.
He’s unveiled a $2.3 trillion “infrastructure” package of the same ilk – with only 7% expected to go towards actual infrastructure.
He’s unveiled his so-called “American Families Plan” – a massive $1.8 trillion spending proposal that will be financed primarily by tax increases.
In fact, in just the first 6 months of his presidency, he’s on track to spend a whopping $6 trillion dollars – a total larger than the amount we spent on World War II, when adjusted for inflation.
On top of that, President Biden has signaled openness to nuking the filibuster and packing the Supreme Court. He’s insultingly and falsely painted Georgia’s election integrity efforts as “Jim Crow 2.0.”
Rather than the “unity” he promised, President Biden has instead delivered extreme partisanship. He’s taken unprecedented action to fulfill a progressive, far-left agenda and to increase the size, scope, and cost of the federal government.
Unfortunately, this agenda will only serve to make Utah and our country less prosperous, less fair, and less free. We have to remember that ultimately, government power is force, and expands at the expense of our liberty.
Hardworking Utahns everywhere deserve an agenda that offers real hope, unity, freedom, and opportunity.
Thank you.

Title: Lee, Rubio Call on Congress to Pass Tax Relief for Working Families
Date: April 28, 2021

Content:
Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a joint statement in response to President Joe Biden’s proposed child allowance plan, which would represent a return to the failed welfare system of the 1990s. In 2017, Lee and Rubio doubled the Child Tax Credit as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which tax return
data confirmed
has cut taxes for millions of American families.
In the statement, the senators called on their colleagues in Congress to join them and pursue meaningful, bipartisan relief for working families by building on their plan to once again dramatically expand the child tax credit:
“In 2017, the Republican Party delivered historic relief to working- and middle-class American families in the form of doubling the child tax credit. The impact was enormous. Working American households making between $20,000 and $50,000 received the largest increase in tax cuts from the expansion, and families with less than $20,000 in income saw their child benefits skyrocket by nearly 250%.
“Earlier this year, we had the chance to do it again. Our plan would have once more boosted the child tax credit—this time to $3,500 per child, and $4,500 per child under the age of six.
“Every single Republican senator present voted in favor.
“But Democrats chose the alternative: simply handing out cash to parents, including ones already on welfare or in households where nobody is working. This kind of universal basic income makes more Americans dependent on government and severs the vital elements—work, marriage, community, and beyond—required to raise healthy families. In doing so, they unraveled the bipartisan welfare reforms previously passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic president.
“Now, President Biden is looking to extend this temporary pandemic cash payment for another four years. The dangers at hand are far from new. As then-Senator Biden put it in 1988, the old American welfare system broke down because ‘it only parcel[ed] out welfare checks and [did] nothing to help the poor find productive jobs.’
“A policy vision intended to help American families going forward cannot be based on yesterday’s failures.
“Senate Republicans unanimously affirmed a better way earlier this year—one that delivers relief for hard-working parents, giving them the tools American families need to flourish and provide for their own. Today, we ask all our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with us to build on this vision and craft a permanent policy that rewards work and protects families.”

Title: Lee and Thune Introduce Bill to Strengthen National Guard Resources and Readiness
Date: April 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and John Thune (R-SD) today introduced the
Guarding Readiness Resources Act, a bill to ensure that National Guard units
receive the reimbursement required by law for
the use of federal
equipment
to support
state missions.
Current federal law allows for the use of helicopters, trucks, and other federal equipment on state missions, but requires that states reimburse the National Guard for the costs associated with their use. However, state reimbursements are automatically diverted to the U.S. Treasury under the Miscellaneous Receipts Act (MRA), which mandates that any funds from a non-congressional source be sent to the Treasury. Without reimbursements, National Guard units are left with significant
shortfalls
in
federal
accounts used for operations and maintenance, under the level of the original congressional appropriation.
“
The National Guard does tremendous work in responding to local emergencies and civil disturbances
on state missions, as the Utah Guard has demonstrated over the last year in responding to riots, wildfires, windstorms, the pandemic, and more,”
said Sen. Lee.
“However, because of an oversight in the MRA, they are shortchanged federal funds crucial for maintenance, repair, and mission readiness. I am grateful to the Utah National Guard for bringing this issue to my attention, and proud to introduce a bill to correct this oversight.”
“National Guardsmen show up and perform difficult missions with little notice, the least Congress can do is ensure units aren’t being left with budget shortfalls,”
said Sen. Thune.
“I am glad to work with Sen. Lee to fix this oversight in the MRA to make certain necessary equipment, property, and training funds remain ready for National Guard missions.”
Specifically, the bill will provide an exemption from the MRA for state reimbursements
to the National Guard, and would apply to every Guard unit across all U.S. states and territories. While the threats in each region might differ, this exemption would ensure that each unit is able to answer the call of duty.

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Smith Lead Letter to CDC on Face Mask Guidance for Kids
Date: April 22, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO) today led
30
of their colleagues in sending a bicameral letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requesting information on how the agency determined its guidance for children aged two years and older to wear face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The Members of Congress wrote in part:
“The implementation of these recommendations has had serious consequences for some Americans. Multiple parents of young children have been removed from flights, and in some instances, permanently banned, from future travel on the airline they were flying due to their toddler’s refusal to wear a mask. These unfortunate events have occurred despite the parents’ best attempts to have their child cooperate with the mask requirement, which is a struggle millions of parents have faced this past year. For parents of children with disabilities, compliance has proved almost impossible, resulting in increased social isolation and negative mental health consequences.”
The full text of the letter can be found
here
and below.
April 22, 2021
Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH
Director
Center for Disease Control and Prevention
395 E St. SW
Washington, DC 20024
Dear Director Walensky,
We write to request that you provide us with information on how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came to its conclusion that children two years and older should wear face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The CDC first put this recommendation forward in March 2020 and since then, many states and localities have based their mask mandate age requirements on it. Additionally, President Biden’s January 21, 2021 Executive Order required that all airports, commercial aircrafts, trains, intercity bus services, and other forms of public transportation comply with the CDC’s guidelines on mask wearing and the CDC subsequently put forward a corresponding mandate that only exempted children under the age of two years.
The implementation of these recommendations has had serious consequences for some Americans. Multiple parents of young children have been removed from flights, and in some instances, permanently banned, from future travel on the airline they were flying due to their toddler’s refusal to wear a mask. These unfortunate events have occurred despite the parents’ best attempts to have their child cooperate with the mask requirement, which is a struggle millions of parents have faced this past year. For parents of children with disabilities, compliance has proved almost impossible, resulting in increased social isolation and negative mental health consequences.
The CDC’s mandate that children as young as 2-years-old must wear facemasks is among the most stringent face mask age requirements in the world. For example, in Switzerland, children under the age of 12 do not have to wear a mask. In the UK and France, children under the age of 11 are exempt. And in Italy, the exemption applies to children under the age of six. The significantly lower age requirement for mask wearing in the United States raises questions about the susceptibility of young children to COVID-19, the rate at which they transmit the disease, and their developmental ability to comply with mask requirements.
Within the United States, children younger than age five account for approximately six percent of the population but only two percent of total coronavirus cases. Further, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, “Several studies have found that children transmit the virus, but perhaps not as often as adults, especially in younger age groups.” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci made a similar assessment in November 2020, stating, “If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected.”
One review of scientific literature on COVID-19 infections showed “evidence for significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults given the same exposure.” Another review that focused on contact-tracing studies and population-screening studies found “preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 56% lower odds of being an infected contact.” A different analysis of 32 studies indicated that “children and adolescents younger than 20 years had 44% lower odds of secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with adults 20 years and older; this finding was most marked in those younger than 10 to 14 years.”
Given evidence indicating the lower likelihood of young children to contract and spread COVID-19 as well as the significant, negative impact of the CDC’s mask guidelines on the lives of Americans with young children, we request that you respond to the following questions:
• Why did the CDC set the minimum age requirement for COVID-19 mask guidelines at two-years-old?
• What specific scientific studies did the CDC base its recommendations on?
• What childhood developmental milestones did the CDC take into consideration when setting the minimum age requirement at two-years-old?
• What steps is the CDC taking to track the latest scientific studies on the contraction and transmission of COVID-19 among children and the effectiveness of masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 by children?
• What plans does the CDC have in place to update its recommendations on mask wearing as new information is gained from these scientific studies about the contraction and spread of COVID-19 by children, especially young children?
• Are you continuing to monitor the science that informs your administration’s guidance on children wearing masks? Are you willing to modify and update your current guidance?
We look forward to receiving your response by May 5, 2021.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces State Grazing Management Authority Act
Date: April 20, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has introduced the State Grazing Management Authority Act, a bill to allow states to manage grazing programs on federal allotments.
In public lands states, the agricultural community – particularly livestock producers – face unique problems in legally accessing and using the federal public lands within their domain. While many states have been able to streamline their grazing processes and work on the state and local level to make their lands more productive, grazers in public lands states are instead forced to navigate layers of bureaucracy and regulation from federal agencies like the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS), which are far removed and often unresponsive to their needs.
“These inefficient federal grazing requirements neither increase grazers’ interest in using federal lands, nor result in better land management,”
said Sen. Lee.
“My bill would instead allow grazers to partner with states – who are both more accountable and responsive to them – to create a more productive and thriving range.”
Specifically, the bill would allow states to enter into cooperative agreements with federal agencies to manage federal grazing allotments. With the increased flexibility and maintenance of range-health standards under the bill, states could take our ailing public lands and help them to thrive.

Date: April 19, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Apple sent a letter to Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) informing them of their decision to allow Parler’s return to the iOS App Store. On March 31st, Sen. Lee and Rep. Buck sent a
letter
to the CEOs of Google, Apple, and Amazon questioning actions their companies took against Parler in January of this year, including Apple’s removal of Parler from its App Store.
Apple’s response reads in part:
“In the period since Apple removed the Parler app from the App Store, Apple’s App Review Team has engaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance with the Guidelines and reinstate it in the App Store. As a result of those conversations, Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices, and the App Review Team has informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstatement to the App Store. Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it.”

Title: Lee, Colleagues Introduce Head Start Improvement Act
Date: April 15, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) today introduced the Head Start Improvement Act, a bill to improve the Head Start program by eliminating bureaucracy and giving money directly to states through block grants. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) has sponsored companion legislation in the House.
State and local governments are better equipped than the federal government to tailor education programs to meet the needs of the children they serve. This legislation recognizes that reality and would empower parents, community leaders, and state and local officials to improve the outcomes of American children everywhere.
“Underprivileged children need access to high-quality education, but the evidence shows that, in its current form, the Head Start program is failing to provide it,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Education reform should empower parents, principals, and teachers, instead of centralizing power and money in political bureaucracies. This bill would allow states, communities, schools, and families to better tailor pre-K programs to the specific needs of each eligible child.”
“If we refuse to reform Head Start, we’re really giving up on its original goal of helping America’s disadvantaged youth. Congress owes it to low-income children to fix Head Start,”
said Rep. Banks.
“Our bill would give states, local officials and parents greater control over Head Start. That will make the program more effective by better tailoring it to individual and community needs.”
“From my decades of experience in education, I know the sooner young people have access to a quality education, the more successful they are. This is especially true for kids who grow up in difficult circumstances and need the safety, security, and mentorship that quality education programs can provide. States are better equipped to serve students than the federal government, and we should direct funding to programs that have a demonstrated record of success. The effort to make quality early education accessible for all is a cause I am proud to fight for with Senator Lee and my colleagues,”
said Sen. Tuberville.
“Glad to join Sen. Lee in introducing the Head Start Improvement Act today,”
Sen. Inhofe said.
“By changing the funding distribution of the Head Start program into block grants to the states, this bill would eliminate unnecessary federal bureaucracy and allow states like Oklahoma to better target these funds to the children and families who need them.”
“Children deserve access to quality education but a one-size-fits-all government program benefits no one. Allowing states to determine how to best use Head Start funds will result in more students having access to higher quality education,”
said Sen. Blackburn.
“Every child deserves the opportunity to get a great education and pursue their dreams,”
said Sen. Rick Scott.
“This bill helps ensure that states and local communities have access to streamlined and flexible resources that allow them to make education decisions that best meet the needs of their students.”
The Head Start Improvement is also supported by Heritage Action and FreedomWorks.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bills to Improve U.S. Aviation Industry
Date: April 15, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has this week introduced four bills to improve and encourage innovation in the U.S. aviation industry: the Aviation Empowerment Act, the Flight Sharing Freedom Act, the Screening Partnership Reform Act, and the Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act. Details about the bills can be found below.
Aviation Empowerment Act
The Aviation Empowerment Act would address outdated FAA rules and regulations that stifle innovation within the general aviation sector by preventing participation in the “sharing economy.”
Currently, “private pilots” may carry a small number of passengers only by coordinating on physical bulletin boards to share flight costs. They are prohibited from coordinating on online platforms, and deemed “common carriers,” like a major airline, if they do so. Since the FAA has not defined “common carrier” in federal law, the FAA has broad authority to determine who and what meets its regulatory interpretation. Furthermore, current federal law prohibits private pilots from receiving compensation for the transport of persons or property.
The Aviation Empowerment Act would help bring 21st century innovation to aviation by correcting these oversights to allow a “flight sharing” economy. In particular, the bill would:
Codify a definition of a “common carrier” based on the FAA’s own internal regulatory definition
Reverse the FAA’s ban on online flight-sharing by allowing private pilots to communicate with the public through the internet, or in any manner they deem appropriate
Create a “personal operator” category of pilot who may fly 8 or fewer passengers for compensation and not be deemed a “common carrier”
Aviation Empowerment Act bill text
Flight Sharing Freedom Act
The Flight Sharing Freedom Act includes two of the reforms in the Aviation Empowerment Act to correct the outdated rules that prevent flight sharing. Specifically, it would:
Codify a definition of a “common carrier” based on the FAA’s own internal regulatory definition
Reverse the FAA’s ban on online flight-sharing by allowing private pilots to communicate with the public through the internet, or in any manner they deem appropriate
Flight Sharing Freedom Act bill text
Screening Partnership Reform Act
The Screening Partnership Reform Act would make changes to the Transportation Safety Administration’s (TSA) Screening Partnership Program (SPP), which allows TSA to contract with private companies to carry out its screening services.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has estimated that the program cuts costs for participating airports by 11%, compared to TSA’s screening. However, the full potential of the program has not been unlocked due to a number of policies that disincentivize airports and security companies from participating.
The Screening Partnership Reform Act would clear some of the bureaucratic red-tape surrounding the program in an attempt to unleash the full cost-saving benefits and further innovation within the SPP, while still safeguarding aviation security. In particular, it would:
Statutorily require TSA’s cost estimation process to account for total costs to the federal government
Give airport operators a role in selecting a private screening company for their airport
Allow private screening companies to conduct on-site training rather than traveling to a Federal Law Enforcement Training Center
Allow private screening companies to submit recommendations to TSA on new and innovative approaches to screening
Clarify ambiguities in hiring practices during transition from TSA to private screening
Screening Partnership Reform Act bill text
Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act
The Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act, or ATC SOAR Act, is designed to decrease the number of applicants that flunk out of the air traffic control academy.
In 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted hiring reforms that prioritized diversity quotas over experienced, qualified candidates through implementing a biographical questionnaire. When Congress prohibited the questionnaire in 2016, the FAA then put the biographical assessments into its Air Traffic Skill Assessment (AT-SA) test. The FAA does not report any information on how AT-SA is graded, and more specifically how the biographical questions factor into the overall score an applicant receives.
The ATC SOAR Act would restore common sense hiring practices to keep our skies safe and ensure that qualified, experienced controller candidates are prioritized. Specifically, the bill would:
Instruct the FAA to consider candidates for interviews based on their qualifications and their score on the AT-SA test
Instruct the FAA to revise the AT-SA test to only include peer-reviewed, job-relevant aptitude questions
Prohibit any biographical questions on the AT-SA test other than basic identifiers (first name, last name)
Require the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation to report to Congress an assessment of the test methodology, the aptitude questions, and the scoring methodology

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces SHUSH Act
Date: April 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON –  Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah
)
has
introduced the Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing Act of 2021, or SHUSH Act, a bill to eliminate the unnecessary regulation of suppressors. The SHUSH Act is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and the House companion legislation is sponsored by Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.).
Silencers are a non-lethal firearm accessory used by hunters, sportsmen, and marksmen to make shooting safer by reducing—though not completely silencing—noise, recoil,
and
muzzle blast.
Currently,
citizens who wish to buy silencers must petition the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) through a
tedious
process that requires completing two copies of ATF Form 4, filling out TF Form 5330.20, obtaining a certification from a local chief law enforcement officer, obtaining two copies of finger prints, obtaining two passport photos, and mailing all of these items plus a $200 check to the ATF. After doing so, the approval process can take another 9-12 months. These requirements make
the
purchase of a non-lethal firearm accessory onerous and prohibitively costly.
“The current, oppressive process required to buy silencers only hurts the eardrums of millions of hunters, sportsmen, and marksmen each year, and serves to provide surreptitious gun control,”
said Sen. Lee.
“The SHUSH Act would eliminate this onerous regulation to make a perfectly legal sport safer for millions of Americans.”
“Streamlining the burdensome process for obtaining a suppressor is important to protect the hearing of hunters and sportsmen across America,”
said Sen. Cruz.
“I’m proud to cosponsor this common sense legislation to protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners.”
“I oppose regulating or taxing the People’s right to keep and bear arms,”
said Rep. Good.
“No constitutional right should be at risk due to public opinion, or subject to regulatory and tax burdens. For the 2nd Amendment, this sentiment certainly extends to safety accessories for firearms. I am proud to join Senator Mike Lee in introducing legislation that would eliminate the current antiquated and overly complicated process for acquiring suppressors and ensure that their purchase is no longer subject to federal regulation.”
Specifically, the bill eliminates federal regulation of silencers
under the National Firearms Act (NFA) and the Gun Control Act (GCA), removing overly burdensome taxes, fees, and registration requirements. The bill removes current restrictions on the right to own, transport, transfer and use a silencer. If passed, it will work in conjunction with the Hearing Protection Act to achieve similar deregulation while additionally removing silencers from the Gun Control Act of 1968.
The bill is supported by Gun Owners of America, the National Rifle Association, and the National Association for Gun Rights.
“Gun Owners of America applauds the introduction of the 'Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing Act' (SHUSH) Act. The SHUSH Act would not only remove suppressors from the federal regulations of the National Firearms Act, but also treat suppressors as any other firearm accessory – free from the infringing background check process. Senator Lee’s bill will not only benefit hunters and sport shooters, but also take much needed steps for gun owners to restore the rights protected by the Second Amendment.”
-
Aidan Johnston, Director of Government Affairs, Gun Owners of America
“Suppressors are accessories and should be treated just like magazines, scopes or gun stocks. Treating an accessory the same as a gun sets a bad precedence for anti-gun legislators to further regulate other accessories in the future. There’s no reason they should be subjected to the Brady registration scheme. We’re happy and privileged to be able to work with Sen. Lee and Rep. Good on this legislation, and excited to continue pushing forward."
- Dudley Brown, President, National Association for Gun Rights

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Subject MLB to Antitrust Laws
Date: April 14, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Josh Hawley (R-Neb.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have introduced a bill to remove the antitrust exemption that has been in place for Major League Baseball to subject them to existing law. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), with over 20 cosponsors, has produced companion legislation in the House.
“Consumers benefit when businesses compete, and baseball is no different. In fact, a professional sports league should understand best of all the benefits of competition,”
said Sen. Lee.
“Instead, Major League Baseball has used its judicially fabricated antitrust immunity to suppress wages and divide up markets for decades—conduct that is plainly illegal, and sometimes criminal, in any other industry. We should have done this decades ago, but when billion-dollar businesses start engaging in political extortion it becomes even more pressing to end their special treatment.”
“For nearly a century, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from antitrust laws that other professional sports leagues do not,”
said Sen. Cruz.
“Major League Baseball asks for your ID when you pick up tickets at will-call, but they have made it clear they oppose photo ID requirements to vote. If Major League Baseball is going to act dishonestly and spread lies about Georgia’s voting rights bill to favor one party against the other, they shouldn’t expect to continue to receive special benefits from Congress.”
“MLB and woke mega-corporations have been coddled by government for too long,”
said Sen. Hawley.
“For decades, the MLB has been given a sweetheart deal by Washington politicians. But if they’d prefer to be partisan political activists instead, maybe it’s time to rethink that. With their capitulation to the left-wing Twitter mob and support for Biden’s big lie about election integrity, they’ve forfeited any right to an anti-trust exemption. They must be held to the same standard as the rest of American business.”
“A corporation that happily does business with the communist regimes in Cuba and China but caves to woke CEOs who want to punish states with Voter ID does not deserve any special immunities in antitrust law,”
said Sen. Blackburn.
“For decades, Major League Baseball has enjoyed a special exemption from the same antitrust laws that govern other businesses in our nation,”
Sen. Rubio said.
“The league has been able to escape scrutiny in part thanks to its perception as a good-faith guardian of America’s national pastime. But with its reprehensible decision to play politics and punish the State of Georgia – and countless small and minority-owned Georgian businesses – by moving the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, the MLB has shown its willingness to use its market power, derived from its antitrust exemption, irresponsibly. Now, Congress is obligated to revisit this unique treatment.”
“Major League Baseball has enjoyed constitutionally questionable antitrust protections for a century, yet it has decided to act in a partisan manner by punishing the state of Georgia for completely reasonable voter integrity and election security legislation,”
said. Rep. Duncan
. “Commissioner Manfred’s decision was ill-advised and will cost Atlanta small businesses, many of which are minority-owned, around $100M in economic activity. Furthermore, public polling has consistently shown overwhelming bipartisan support for voter ID laws, which are the cornerstone of the Georgia elections reform bill. This is just the latest in a wave of corporate decisions to ‘Go Woke.’ If companies or organizations want to undermine efforts to ensure the integrity of our elections process, then they invite increased scrutiny of their business practices. I urge Major League Baseball to reconsider this short-sighted decision, and I urge my colleagues to stand strong against the onslaught of the Woke Left on daily American life.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Help Military Families
Date: April 13, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON –  Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act, bipartisan legislation that would give military spouses with valid professional licenses in one state reciprocity in the state where their spouse is currently serving on military orders.
The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.)
,
John Boozman (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Roger Wicker (R-Miss), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Jim Risch (R-Idaho).
Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) has introduced companion legislation in the House.
“Faced with a 50-state patchwork of licensing laws, military spouses are forced to spend thousands of dollars and hours to obtain licensure every time they move to a new state under military orders,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will help lift that unjust burden on our military families – who sacrifice so much to protect our nation – by ensuring that spouses can receive the licensing reciprocity they need across state lines.”
“Military families have enough things to worry about, they should not have to also worry about getting a new professional license every time their spouse receives new orders,”
said Rep. Garcia.
“As a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, I understand the burden military families carry when they have to move locations. Our men and women in uniform and their families sacrifice so much for this nation and they deserve all the support they can get. I am grateful to Senator Mike Lee for joining me in this effort to remove this burdensome obstacle that many military families face and help ensure our military families have the support that they deserve.”
“Montana military spouses make great sacrifices for our nation,”
said Sen. Daines.
“Many Montana families move often and it’s difficult for spouses that have occupational licenses to continue their careers after each move to a new state. We must cut this red tape that puts undue burdens on our military families who serve our country selflessly.”
“In Wyoming, we recognize the sacrifice that our service members and their families make every day,” said
Sen. Barrasso.
“Military families often move every two to three years. The last thing they need to worry about is spending time and money trying to maintain their careers in a new state. Our bipartisan bill will make it easier for military spouses to transition the professional licenses they’ve already worked hard to obtain when they move to a new duty station.”
"Military spouses serve our country every day, and they deserve career opportunities wherever their families are stationed,"
said Sen. Tillis.
"I have always been an advocate for our servicemembers and their families, and this bill helps military spouses carry professional licensure wherever the country may need them."
“The United States Armed Forces are not just made up of brave men and women in uniform but also the families at home who make their service possible,”
said Sen. Blackburn.
“For spouses frequently moving across state lines, keeping up with state-level professional licensing regulations can be a near-impossible task. The Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act is an essential piece of bipartisan legislation to remove bureaucratic red tape and support our nation’s heroes.”
“Sacrifice is common for service members and their families, but we should act to ease those burdens where we can,”
Sen. Hyde-Smith said.
“This legislation would alleviate the costs and time associated with unnecessary state-to-state relicensing requirements and, ultimately, help military spouses to fulfill their career goals.  This policy would be a win for military families and local businesses looking for qualified workers.”
“A servicemember’s oath to protect and defend our nation impacts their families as well, and military spouses often have to spend hundreds of dollars obtaining new professional licenses every time their spouse receives orders to move to a new state,”
said Sen. Moran.
“This legislation would ensure military spouses with professional licenses are able to utilize their credentials in each new state their spouse is stationed without going through the costly and time-consuming process of obtaining a new license.”
“Half of military spouses work in a field requiring licensing,”
said Senator Cramer.
“Our bill would make it easier for them to keep their jobs when they and their families are transferred to a different state. It is a common sense way to improve their livelihood and attract more talent to bases across the country.”
“Our military families make significant sacrifices in service to our nation, including relocating often due to new military orders,”
said Sen. Hoeven.
“This legislation would help ease the transition to a new state by making it easier for a military spouse with a professional license to continue working. This is an important way to show our support for the families of those who are serving our nation.”
In order to receive reciprocity, a license must be in good standing; and the spouse must still comply with the state’s standards of practice, discipline, and fulfillment of any continuing education requirements. As a state function, protected under the Tenth Amendment, the bill does not preempt the states’ rightful authority to set their own licensing standards.

Title: After Urging from Lee and Klobuchar, Apple Agrees to Send Witness To Hearing on App Stores and Mobile App Competition
Date: April 12, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ranking Member and Chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, yesterday announced that both Apple and Google have agreed to send witnesses to a subcommittee hearing on app stores and mobile app competition scheduled for Wednesday, April 21, 2021 at 2:30 PM. In a letter sent on Friday, April 9th, 2021, Lee and Klobuchar criticized Apple’s initial decision to withhold witnesses from testifying and asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to reverse course.
“I am glad that Apple has changed course and agreed to testify before the Subcommittee,”
said Senator Lee.
“Utahns are eager to learn what we can do to better protect and promote competition in the digital ecosystem, and it’s essential that Apple and others make good faith contributions to that effort.”
“The fact that there are just two gatekeepers between consumers and the millions of online applications available for download raises serious competition concerns. These companies have the power to control how and if mobile app developers can reach app users, and ultimately, which apps become successful,”
said Senator Klobuchar.
“This hearing will explore whether Apple and Google are using their power as gatekeepers to charge high fees and impose restrictions that suppress competition in mobile applications and related markets, and both companies‘  participation in the hearing is necessary.”
Consumers rely on mobile applications to access online content and services, and the vast majority of apps are downloaded from either Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store. The hearing will focus on the impact of Apple’s and Google’s power over the cost, distribution, and availability of mobile applications on consumers, app developers, and competition.

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Buck Question Big Tech CEOs on Actions Against Parler
Date: April 1, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) on Wednesday sent a letter to the CEOs of Google, Apple, and Amazon questioning a series of actions their companies took against Parler.
The letter reads in part:
“As detailed in the timeline below, the timing of steps taken against the Parler social network by your companies and that the actions seem to lack any of the procedural fairness typically afforded in the case of an alleged breach of contract create the appearance of close coordination.
According to public sources:
On January 8, 2021 Apple sent Parler notice of expulsion from the App Store. Parler was provided only 24 hours to remediate. Google sent Parler notice of expulsion from the Play Store, reportedly within hours of Apple’s notice. Parler was not provided a remediation option. Later in the day, Google removed Parler from the Play Store.
On January 9, 2021 Apple removed Parler from the App Store. Amazon sent Parler a notice of suspension of their cloud services. No remediation option was provided.
On January 10, 2021 Amazon suspended service to Parler.
In just three days, Apple and Google effectively cut off Parler’s primary distribution channel, and Amazon cut off Parler’s access to critical computing services, leaving the company completely unable to serve its 15 million users. These actions were against a company that is not alleged to have violated any law. In fact, information provided by Parler to the House Oversight Committee revealed that Parler was
assisting
law enforcement even in advance of January 6th.”

Title: ICYMI: Sen. Lee Visits Mexico Border, Calls for End to Crisis
Date: March 29, 2021

Content:
Last week, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined a congressional delegation trip with 17 of his colleagues to help shed light on the humanitarian crisis caused by the recent surges in illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. The senators toured immigration processing facilities along the border, attended a roundtable with local leaders, and heard firsthand accounts of the journeys of migrant men, women, and children.
Sen. Lee highlighted how the deliberate non-enforcement of our laws, as well as the policies and promises of the Biden administration, have created the crisis – encouraging waves of immigration, enriching drug cartels and coyotes, and subjecting vulnerable women and children to sexual assault, abuse, and trafficking.
Sen. Lee last week also introduced legislation called the Stopping Border Surges Act, a bill to address loopholes in our immigration system which encourage vulnerable immigrant populations to take dangerous, illegal paths of entry into the United States. The simple, common-sense adjustments it proposes would help ensure the integrity of our borders, and remove perverse incentives for parents to entrust their children to coyotes and cartels.
To learn more about the bill, and for in-depth coverage of the visit, see the content below.
The Stopping Border Surges Act
This bill proposed immediate, common-sense reforms that would help stem the flood of immigrants at our border and protect vulnerable women and children from the clutches of the cartels and coyotes. Sadly, it was blocked by Senate Democrats.
The Biden Administration has closed the border to press to minimize the crisis.
The Biden Administration has closed the border to press in an attempt to minimize the crisis, so we are here to tell the story of what’s really happening. Cartels are making millions of dollars per week. Our Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed. Thousands of people are crossing our border illegally everyday and entering our country without the same COVID testing requirements as American citizens.
President Biden promised surges at the border. And he delivered.
President Biden promised surges at the border. And he delivered. The resulting humanitarian crisis could easily have been avoided. The smugglers, cartels and coyotes are so emboldened by these policies that they taunt our Border Patrol officers.
Deeply troubled to see hundreds of people at the border.
It was deeply troubling to see hundreds of people at the border so late, so many of whom were women and children, who had entrusted their lives to ruthless smugglers and drug cartels.
Lawlessness is not compassion.
We’re a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We don’t need to choose one or the other. Lawlessness is not compassion.
There is no plausible policy justification for ending the Migrant Protection Protocols program.
There is not any plausible policy justification for the decision to end the Migrant Protection Protocols program. There is no reason whatsoever that someone from Central or South America, when coming by land to the United States, could not apply for asylum in Mexico and remain in Mexico while their asylum applications are pending.

Title: Sen. Lee Cosponsors the Smarter Sentencing Act
Date: March 26, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) cosponsored the “Smarter Sentencing Act,” bipartisan legislation designed to bring judicial discretion and flexibility to non-violent drug charge sentencing. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin (D- Ill.) and cosponsored by 11 of their colleagues.
Since 1980, the number of inmates in federal prison has increased by 653%. About 50% of those federal inmates are serving sentences for drug-related offenses, increasing the taxpayer burden by more than 2,000%. In short, federal incarceration has become one of our nation’s biggest expenditures, dwarfing the amount spent on law enforcement.
Our burgeoning prison population traces much of its growth to the increasing number and length of certain federal mandatory sentences. More than 60% of federal district court judges agree that existing mandatory minimums for all offenses are too high. In the words of the members of the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission, “the Commission unanimously believes that certain mandatory minimum penalties apply too broadly, are excessively severe, and are applied inconsistently . . . .”
“Our current federal sentencing laws are out of date and often counterproductive,”
said Sen. Lee.
“The Smarter Sentencing Act is a commonsense solution that will greatly reduce the financial and, more importantly, the human cost imposed on society by the broken status quo. The SSA will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses, while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to their families and communities.”
“Mandatory minimum penalties have played a large role in the explosion of the U.S. prison population, often leading to sentences that are unfair, fiscally irresponsible, and a threat to public safety,”
Sen. Durbin said.
“
The
First Step Act
was a critical move in the right direction, but there is much more work to be done to reform our criminal justice system.  I will keep fighting to get this commonsense, bipartisan legislation through the Senate with my colleague, Senator Lee.”
Lee and Durbin first introduced the
Smarter Sentencing Act
in 2013.  Several important reforms from the
Smarter Sentencing Act
were included in the landmark First Step Act, which was enacted into law in 2018.  The central remaining sentencing reform in the Durbin-Lee legislation would reduce mandatory minimum penalties for certain nonviolent drug offenses. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementation of this provision would save taxpayers approximately $3 billion over ten years.

Title: Sen. Lee Cosponsors the Smarter Sentencing Act
Date: March 26, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) cosponsored the “Smarter Sentencing Act,” bipartisan legislation designed to bring judicial discretion and flexibility to non-violent drug charge sentencing. The bill is sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin (D- Ill.) and cosponsored by 11 of their colleagues.
Since 1980, the number of inmates in federal prison has increased by 653%. About 50% of those federal inmates are serving sentences for drug-related offenses, increasing the taxpayer burden by more than 2,000%. In short, federal incarceration has become one of our nation’s biggest expenditures, dwarfing the amount spent on law enforcement.
Our burgeoning prison population traces much of its growth to the increasing number and length of certain federal mandatory sentences. More than 60% of federal district court judges agree that existing mandatory minimums for all offenses are too high. In the words of the members of the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission, “the Commission unanimously believes that certain mandatory minimum penalties apply too broadly, are excessively severe, and are applied inconsistently . . . .”
“Our current federal sentencing laws are out of date and often counterproductive,”
said Sen. Lee.
“The Smarter Sentencing Act is a commonsense solution that will greatly reduce the financial and, more importantly, the human cost imposed on society by the broken status quo. The SSA will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses, while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to their families and communities.”
“Mandatory minimum penalties have played a large role in the explosion of the U.S. prison population, often leading to sentences that are unfair, fiscally irresponsible, and a threat to public safety,”

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Poverty Measurement Improvement Act
Date: March 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today reintroduced the Poverty Measurement Improvement Act, a bill that would improve the accuracy of poverty measurement in the United States by requiring the Census Bureau to supplement its existing poverty data with additional data from other federal agencies.
“
To help the vulnerable in our social safety net programs, we must make sure that our limited resources are being used as effectively as possible, and going towards those who are most in need,”
Sen. Lee said.
“This bill will help us ensure that we have the data to do just that.”
For decades, the Census Bureau’s official poverty rate (OPR) has been the central point of reference for estimating the number of Americans living in poverty, and for guiding policymakers in evaluating and reforming welfare programs. However, its methods and metrics have made it a fundamentally inaccurate survey, as it fails to capture all the income and benefits that low-income Americans receive. In its current form, the survey’s participants dramatically underreport both income and receipt of funds – artificially inflating the poverty rate, and undermining the ability of the government to accurately assess and reform the welfare programs.
The bill would require the Census Bureau Director to produce a new, more accurate and comprehensive measure of poverty alongside the current official poverty rate and Supplemental Poverty Measure, and to provide a report comparing the measures.

Title: Sens. Lee, Crapo, and Risch Introduce MORE PILT Act
Date: March 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) on Thursday introduced the Making Obligations Right by Enlarging Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act, or MORE PILT Act.
Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) joined as original cosponsors of the bill.
States, counties, and local governments are not able to collect property taxes on public lands in their jurisdictions. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was established in 1977 to provide funding to offset the absence of property tax revenue. Unfortunately, PILT payments have historically been a small fraction of what local governments would otherwise generate through property taxes, leaving rural communities in Western states deprived of crucial funds.
“Without a property tax base, and with woefully inadequate PILT payments, Western states and communities struggle to fund their schools, infrastructure, and vital community services,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will help ensure that PILT payments more accurately reflect the lands’ value, so that the citizens of our public lands states have the means they need to both survive and thrive.”
Specifically, the bill would direct the Secretary of Interior to build a model, conduct a study or economic analysis, and issue a report to determine the value of federal land eligible for payment under PILT, as well as the forgone property tax revenues that counties would have otherwise received.

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce U.S.-U.K. Free Trade Resolution
Date: March 24, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) today introduced a resolution recognizing the mutual history and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, and expressing the Sense of the Senate that the United States President should lay the groundwork for a mutually advantageous future trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K.
“For more than 100 years, throughout times of change and tumult, the U.S. and the U.K. have been staunch and stalwart allies in the fight to combat terrorism, and to secure freedom, peace, and prosperity,”
said Sen. Lee.
“In the post-pandemic economic and geopolitical climate, and with the U.K.’s newfound ability to negotiate independent free trade deals, the American and British peoples have the opportunity to once again join forces. This resolution would strengthen our special relationship and economic partnership, for the benefit of our nations and nations across the globe."
“The United Kingdom is one of our nation’s most important and reliable trading partners,”
said Sen. Lankford.
“The Biden Administration should not delay to complete talks with the United Kingdom on our trade agreements to provide certainty for Oklahomans and Oklahoma businesses. Americans are eager to have a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with our oldest ally and expand transatlantic business opportunities.”
“The United States and United Kingdom have been allies for generations, and successfully negotiating a trade agreement between our two nations will build on that strong relationship,”
said Sen. Moran.
“A trade deal that increases economic commerce between our countries by reducing trade barriers, increasing investments and modernizing our trading relationship will benefit American producers and consumers, including Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.”
“The United States and the United Kingdom have always had a special relationship and a shared history that reveals itself today in our strong economic partnership and allyship in the fight against terrorism,”
said Sen. Braun.
“With the U.K. newly independent from the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. can now strengthen that special relationship through mutually beneficial trade agreements.”
“The United States and United Kingdom have a unique opportunity to grow our economies and cement a free and equitable trade agreement,”
said Sen. Scott.
“As our nations face growing threats, including that of Communist China, we must work together and stand united for freedom and democracy. Our resolution stresses the need for a strong free-trade agreement with one of our nation’s greatest allies, and urges President Biden to pursue this great opportunity and reach a deal that is positive for both our nations.”
The resolution would help further strengthen the already-robust trading relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. In 2019, the total Anglo-American trade in goods and services was $273 billion, and the U.K. was the U.S.’s seventh largest trading partner in goods. Additionally, the U.K. market’s appetite for U.S.-made goods is flourishing. The United States held a $21.8 billion total trade surplus with the U.K. in 2019, and American exports of goods and services to the U.K. supported an estimated 665,000 U.S. jobs in 2015.

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce Stopping Border Surges Act
Date: March 23, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Monday introduced the Stopping Border Surges Act, a bill to address loopholes in our immigration system which encourage vulnerable immigrant populations to take dangerous, illegal paths of entry into the United States.
“Loopholes in our immigration system perversely compel women and children to entrust their savings, futures, and lives to cartels and coyotes –  endangering the safety of vulnerable immigrants, and undermining the integrity of our system,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill would help stop these dangerous opportunities for abuse.”
“Migrants exploit our immigration system to illegally enter and stay in the United States,”
said Senator Blackburn.
“This process enriches cartels and coyotes that traffic illegal immigrants across the border. The sad truth is many of the young women and children are sexually abused and assaulted during their journey to the United States. We need to stop this dangerous cycle of abuse.”
“By reversing some of President Trump’s most successful border policies, President Biden has sent a ‘come one, come all’ signal to immigrants. Not only has this created a surge of illegal immigrants coming across the border, but it’s also created an environment that is ripe for abuse,”
said Sen. Tuberville.
“This bill prevents the exploitation of our immigration laws to the benefit of people willing to use vulnerable migrants, including children, to further illegal behavior. Children should not be used as a free pass to get into our country. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill.”
“The current surge of migrants at our border, due in large part to the immediate and illogical reversal of the previous administration’s policies, underscores the need for Congress to work together to address this humanitarian and national security crisis. Right now, loopholes in our immigration system are encouraging unaccompanied children and families to make the perilous journey—at the hands of ruthless smugglers—to enter the U.S. through our now-open southern border. This bill will close a number of these loopholes and help stop this dangerous surge,”
said Sen. Ernst.
“Each day the humanitarian, national security, and public health crises on our southern border produced by President Biden's open-borders policies and immigration loopholes continue to worsen,”
said Sen. Cruz. “
Because President Biden’s administration has irresponsibly promised amnesty, thousands of illegal immigrants are being moved across the border—many of which are unaccompanied children—by vicious and abusive criminal cartels. As we work to control this border crisis, I am proud to join Senator Lee in introducing this bill to close these loopholes in our immigration system that continue to incentivize human trafficking and illegal immigration.”
The past few months have demonstrated the dangerous costs of immigration surges at our southern border. In just the last month, traffickers have allegedly made as much as $14 million dollars a week smuggling vulnerable men, women and children across the border—and once indebted to the cartels and coyotes, the price they pay is far more costly than money. Reportedly, a third of the people making their way to the border are sexually assaulted, and many are forced into some form of trafficking.
In addition to empowering the cartels and coyotes, these surges have overwhelmed our facilities and our ability to process immigrants in a timely and safe fashion. In recent days, thousands of unaccompanied minors have been held in overcrowded Customs and Border Patrol facilities built to house adults, with no end in sight; and adults have been prematurely released into the community, receiving positive COVID-19 tests only days after their release.
The Stopping Border Surges Act includes reforms that would help stem the surges of aliens that our country can neither support nor sustain; strengthen our asylum process; eliminate the incentive to send children on the perilous, solo journey to the border; and dampen the exploitative power of the coyotes and cartels.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Protecting American Jobs Act
Date: March 22, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today reintroduced the Protecting American Jobs Act, a bill that would strip the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of its power to prosecute and adjudicate labor disputes.
The NLRB, an independent federal agency consisting of five political appointees, was established to carry out the National Labor Relations Act. However, it has historically ignored traditional standards of due process, operated under lengthy and bureaucratic procedures, and caved to political pressures.
The Protecting American Jobs Act would transfer the power to hear labor disputes back to federal courts, in line with the court system established by the Constitution. The NLRB would retain the power to conduct investigations, but would not be allowed to prosecute them.
“For far too long the NLRB has acted as judge, jury, and executioner, for labor disputes in this country,”
Sen. Lee said.
“The havoc they have wrought by upsetting decades of established labor law has cost countless jobs. This common sense legislation would finally restore fairness and accountability to our nation’s labor laws."
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) has introduced companion legislation in the House.
See below for outside support:
“For decades, whenever Big Labor controls the White House, the NLRB has been wielded as a taxpayer-funded union organizing tool. The NLRB is not a department of the Executive Branch.  It is supposed to be a quasi-judicial, independent agency, and it was given the privilege of making binding, judicial rulings. Unfortunately, given the Board’s repeated failure to remain independent, it’s time for that privilege to be revoked. We are proud to stand with Senator Lee and Congressman Scott in the fight to protect workers and return judicial authority to the courts, where it belongs.”

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Davis-Bacon Repeal Act
Date: March 18, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act Wednesday, a bill designed to repeal the wage subsidy law requiring all federally funded projects worth more than $2,000 to pay workers the “prevailing wage” rate on non-federal projects in the same locality.
“The Davis Bacon Act exemplifies how big government hurts the people it purports to help, gives unfair advantages to favored special interests, and squeezes the middle class,”
Sen. Lee said.
“The Davis-Bacon Repeal Act would remove these government-imposed obstacles to economic opportunity facing low-skilled workers, and return wasted taxpayer dollars back into the hands of the American people.”
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.).
See below for support from outside groups:
“The Davis-Bacon Act is a Jim Crowe relic that that funnels federal project funding to politically-connected union firms at the expense of the 89.2% of American workers who have chosen not to join a union. Repealing Davis-Bacon would empower independent, merit-shop contractors to bid competitively on the projects financed by their own tax dollars. We are proud to stand by Senator Lee in calling for the elimination of this taxpayer subsidy to Big Labor.”
- Greg Mourad, Vice President of the National Right to Work Committee
“Eliminating or modernizing the Davis-Bacon Act would create the conditions for all qualified contractors and their skilled workforce to compete to rebuild their communities and give taxpayers additional value for investments in public works projects as Congress works to enact critical infrastructure modernization and America faces a $2.6 trillion infrastructure gap by 2029.”

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces CBO Show Your Work Act
Date: March 18, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced the “CBO Show Your Work” Act Wednesday, legislation designed to improve the legislative process by making the Congressional Budget Office more transparent and accountable.
“Congress does need a scorekeeper to provide budgetary estimates for the policy changes it considers,”
Sen. Lee said.
“But at a bare minimum, that scorekeeper should be forced to show how its models work, which the CBO doesn’t currently have to do. This bill would require the CBO to publish its data, models, and all details of computation used in its cost analysis and scoring, so that the American people and the economic community can see the math for themselves.”
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mo.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Call for Judiciary Hearing on Obama-Biden FTC’s Sweetheart Deal with Google
Date: March 18, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sent letters to Federal Trade Commission Acting Chair (FTC) Rebecca Slaughter and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) calling for a public Judiciary Hearing into
recent revelations
that the Obama-Biden FTC failed to enforce antitrust law in an 2011 investigation of Google and instead let the company off with a slap on the wrist. The senators call for testimony from Google executives and relevant FTC officials, including the former Commissioners who now represent big tech firms.
“In 2011, I was one of the few voices in Congress questioning Google’s business practices. Based on recent revelations, it appears I was right, and the FTC dropped the ball. All while Google executives enjoyed unprecedented access to the Obama White House,”
said Sen. Lee.
“The American people deserve answers from the FTC about its handling of the investigation, and from Google about whether it used political influence to shield its quest for monopoly power. I look forward to working with Chairman Durbin to hold everyone responsible to account.”
The senators wrote in part:
“The FTC’s inaction has had broad-sweeping implications for our economy, our culture, and our democracy. In the intervening years, Google has amassed—and exploited—an ever-growing market share in search and digital advertising and smartphones, and has used these dominant positions to make inroads into other product lines and services. As distressing as these consequences may be, the FTC’s inaction has had consequences far beyond the actions and market power of a single firm. The FTC’s failure to enforce the nation’s antitrust laws signaled to similarly dominant market participants, in tech or elsewhere, that compliance is optional. In other words, lax enforcement of our laws encourages lawlessness. Regulators responsible for this era of underenforcement, which has resulted in unprecedented economic concentration, must be held to account, on the record.”

Title: Utah Delegation, State Officials Welcome Interior Secretary Haaland’s Decision to Visit Utah

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and Representatives Chris Stewart (R-Utah), John Curtis (R-Utah), Burgess Owens (R-Utah), and Blake Moore (R-Utah), Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Brad Wilson and Attorney General Sean Reyes issued the following statement in response to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s announcement of her upcoming visit to Utah to tour Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments.
“As Utah leaders, we urged the administration to extend the 60-day timeline outlined in President Biden’s Executive Order calling for a review of our national monuments and invited Secretary Haaland to visit Utah to tour the monuments and engage state, local, and tribal leaders. We are encouraged that the administration has extended the deadline for review of Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments, and we welcome Secretary Haaland’s decision to travel to Utah, tour the monuments in question, and receive meaningful input from the local elected officials and residents. Her trip to Utah will allow her the opportunity to speak with the people who live and work on the lands, whose voices may otherwise go unheard, before making any recommendations to the President. We are also confident that this trip will successfully highlight the need for a permanent legislative solution for determining appropriate boundaries for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, with statutory protections to prevent abuses under the Antiquities Act for the State of Utah. We look forward to continuing our work on these issues with Secretary Haaland after her visit.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Tillis, and Paul Introduce Mens Rea Reform Act
Date: March 12, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) yesterday introduced the Mens Rea Reform Act of 2021, a bill that aims to reduce overcriminalization, rein in excessive regulation, and curb overzealous prosecutions.
As the power of the federal government has grown in size and scope, regulators and prosecutors have found ways to penalize activities that most Americans would view as innocent or non-criminal. As a result, ordinary Americans have found themselves facing jail time for supposedly “criminal” activities like abandoning a snowmobile on federal land, accidentally diverting sewage backups to the wrong drain, or unknowingly selling goods to the wrong person. In each of these cases, the government did not have to prove that the person
knew
or
intended
to commit a crime; they simply had to prove that the person committed the
action
.
Current federal law criminalizes all kinds of activities that most people would not know were criminal. For example, “[p]lacing a vehicle or other object in such a manner that it is an impediment . . . to the . . . convenience of any person” on federal property or writing a check for less than $1 could earn someone six months in prison. These crimes do not require the government to demonstrate that someone
intended
to do something wrong—merely that they engaged in the prohibited conduct.
Additionally, many of these so-called “criminal” statutes were written by unelected bureaucrats. Agency regulators and prosecutors have used laws like the Clean Water Act for decades to punish conduct most Americans would view as innocent, or at least not criminal.
“Prosecutors should have to show a suspect had a guilty mind, not just that they committed an illegal act, before an American citizen is put behind bars,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Unfortunately, our federal laws contain far too many provisions that do not require prosecutors to prove a defendant intended to commit a crime. The result is a criminal justice system that over-penalizes innocent acts, which only undermines the rule of law.”
“We’ve unfortunately seen too many instances of commonsense and restraint not being used in the prosecution of Americans for innocent acts with no criminal intent,”
said Sen. Tillis.
“Our legislation will help curb unfair overcriminalization by requiring prosecutors to demonstrate guilty intent.”
The Mens Rea Reform Act would end this wrongful government overreach by establishing a default intent standard for all criminal laws and regulations. In other words, if a law does not require proof that the defendant
intended
to commit a crime, prosecutors would still have to demonstrate that the defendant possessed a guilty mind in order to convict.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Allied Burden Sharing Report Act
Date: March 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced the Allied Burden Sharing Report Act Wednesday, a bill that would require the Department of Defense to resume submitting an extensive report that includes the common defense contributions of NATO countries and other defense partners, including Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines, and signatories of the Rio Treaty. The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Josh Hawley (R-Neb.),  James Lankford (R-Okl.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Bill Haggerty (R-Tenn.).
A report of this kind was originally ordered in the 1985 National Defense Authorization Act, and continued in some form until 2004, when the Pentagon officials decided to shift their focus to our allies’ contributions to the Global War on Terror. The bill would require that this valuable report be brought back as our geopolitical climate continues to shift.
“NATO and our other defense alliances have proven to be crucial over the years,”
said Sen. Lee.
“But for our alliances to be strong, effective, and trustworthy, all parties must keep their spending promises, not just the United States. This bill will help ensure that all parties are pulling their weight in our defense partnerships, and will help provide Congress a fuller picture of our allies’ capabilities and the state of the common defense.”
“I cannot in good conscience look away as America crumbles at home, and politicians tax us to send money to fund endless wars. For far too long, our allies have taken advantage of America and have failed to contribute to the common defense. That is not putting America first, and it is by far time we allow Congress to fulfill its oversight duties and pass the Allied Burden Sharing Report Act,”
said Sen. Paul.
The report would be submitted annually to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and made available to any member of Congress.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Global Trade Accountability Act
Date: March 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced the Global Trade Accountability Act Wednesday, a bill that would subject unilateral actions by the president to increase trade barriers to congressional approval. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) joined as cosponsors of the bill.
“Congress has ceded far too much of its lawmaking power to the executive branch, including the power to unilaterally raise tariffs,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Sudden hikes in trade barriers can have real and devastating impacts on American small businesses, farmers, and families, including in my home state of Utah. As the deliberative body and the people’s representatives, Congress must be involved in any decision that would increase barriers to trade, especially as global supply lines continue to be disrupted from the pandemic.”
“The Kansas economy depends on sound trade policies, and imposing undue tariffs or other trade restrictions can have serious ramifications on Kansas agriculture and manufacturing,”
said Sen. Moran.
“For too long, administrations have been making trade decisions without appropriate input from the legislative branch, and this legislation would reinstate Congress’ constitutional authority over commerce with foreign countries.”
“As a constitutional republic, tax increases should never be imposed by the whim of one person,”
said Sen. Paul.
“The Founders deliberately crafted a system that prevented one branch from becoming more powerful than others and it would have been inconceivable to the Revolutionary generation that the President could unilaterally raise tariffs, which are taxes on foreign imports paid by consumers of those products. The Global Trade Accountability Act restores the Founders’ vision by requiring Congress to deliberate and potentially block on any tariff proposals that effectively raise taxes on the American people.”
The Global Trade Accountability Act would require both chambers of Congress to affirmatively approve of any “unilateral trade actions” by the president before they could take effect, which are defined in this legislation as any increases in tariffs or duties, tightening of tariff-rate quotas or quantitative restrictions on imports, and other restrictions or prohibitions on imports. However, the Act does allow for “national emergency” exceptions for a period of 90 days, after which the president would still have to obtain approval from both chambers of Congress.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces UNSHACKLE Act
Date: March 11, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today reintroduced the Undoing NEPA’s Substantial Harm by Advancing Concepts that Kickstart the Liberation of the Economy (UNSHACKLE) Act, legislation that would comprehensively reform the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).
“Environmental planning is essential to sustainable growth, but unfortunately NEPA has become a weapon used by special interests to make much-needed infrastructure and maintenance projects throughout our country prohibitively expensive,”
Sen. Lee said. “
The UNSHACKLE Act will reform the NEPA process so that federal agencies, state, and local governments are better empowered to carry out NEPA’s original
goal,
while also making our nation’s infrastructure and maintenance project affordable again.”
The UNSHACKLE Act is comprehensive NEPA legislation that combines five other stand-alone reform bills on agency process, state expansion, legal changes, and data reporting into one comprehensive text.
The stand-alone bills have also been independently introduced. For details, see the summary and links below:
NEPA Agency Process Accountability Act
Mandates only one Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Environmental Assessment (EA) for each project
Mandates that agencies must re-use relevant environmental research from related prior projects, and cannot offer alternatives that are not economically feasible
Allows agencies to use state environmental documents for proposed projects
NEPA Accountability and Enforcement Act
Requires federal agencies to complete the NEPA process in two years for proposed projects that need an EIS
Imposes a one year deadline for agencies to issue a Categorical Exclusion (CE) and complete the NEPA process for projects with an EA
Requires agencies to approve or deny permits within 90 days of completion of the NEPA process
NEPA State Assignment Expansion Act
Expands the NEPA assignment program to let federal agencies delegate NEPA review authority to relevant state entities, which can can carry out NEPA review on the agency’s behalf, under the supervision of the agency
NEPA Legal Reform Act
Clarifies requirements necessary for to receive judicial review for NEPA-related claims
Sets a 150-day statute of limitations for NEPA-related claims

U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Representatives Chris Stewart (R-UT), John Curtis (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Blake Moore (R-UT), today met with senior officials at the Department of Interior to encourage the Biden administration to work with Congress toward a permanent legislative solution that resolves the boundaries for the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Following their meeting, they released the following joint statement:
“We appreciated the opportunity to express our desire for a permanent legislative solution that reflects state, local, and tribal input, resolves the status of these iconic national monuments, and brings certainty to land management in our state. During the meeting, we reiterated our concerns that the Biden administration’s review may result in further unilateral executive action, which will not resolve longstanding boundary or access issues. We urged the administration to instead engage state, local, and tribal leaders to develop a solution which is supported by the State of Utah and tribal governments, and codified by Congress. Because the state and delegation are willing to collaborate on an inclusive legislative solution, we believe it would be inappropriate for the administration to proceed with a unilateral executive action until there is sufficient time to negotiate broadly supported compromise legislation. The Utah Congressional Delegation looks forward to speaking with President Biden about a legislative approach that puts an end to the political back-and forth of Utah’s monuments.”
Background:
Last week, the entire Utah congressional delegation
sent a letter
to President Biden requesting the administration’s support in finding a permanent legislative solution for determining appropriate boundaries for the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, as well as statutory protections to prevent abuses under the Antiquities Act. It also requests that President Biden extend the 60-day review period timeline in order to allow the Secretary of the Interior time to travel to Utah, tour the monuments in question, and receive input from local stakeholders. After President Biden issued the January Executive Order, the delegation
urged the administration
to work with Congress toward a permanent legislative solution to the boundaries.

Title: Lee, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Continue to Protect Faith-Based Child Welfare Providers
Date: March 10, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee today joined Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and 21 of their colleagues in introducing the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, a bill to protect organizations that provide adoption and foster care services from discrimination based on their religious or moral beliefs.
“Religious institutions and faith-based groups have long provided some of the best adoption services in the country,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will protect their right to keep doing so in accordance with their beliefs, and ensure that children are not unnecessarily prevented from being adopted into loving homes.”
“In South Carolina and across the country, faith-based foster care providers support the 400,000 children in our foster care system who—through no fault of their own—have nowhere else to go,”
said Sen. Tim Scott.
“At a time when religious freedoms are under assault, the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act is a necessary protection for those who are living according to their convictions. I am grateful my colleagues are standing with me to protect this most fundamental right.”
U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-Penn.) introduced companion legislation in the House.
“Several state and local governments are requiring faith-based adoption agencies to choose between helping kids and violating their religious faith,”
said Rep. Mike Kelly.
“This blatant attack on the First Amendment makes it even harder for children to find loving homes. We must stand up for kids, protect these organizations, and defend religious liberty. I am proud to author this legislation.”
The full list of cosponsors includes: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).
Supporting organizations include: Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Heritage Action, and the Family Research Council.
“Far too many children are waiting, right now, either for adoption or foster families. Our government must not stand in the way of those seeking to care for them. It is difficult to imagine a more important goal for child welfare policy than the goal of seeing vulnerable children who need a loving home be united with families committed to caring for them. Protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care agencies only ensures that more children will have access to the love and support they so desperately need. This is precisely what the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would do.”
– Russell Moore, President, Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission
Background
The Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would protect child welfare providers from being discriminated against for acting in accordance with their deeply held religious beliefs.
Specifically, the bill would prohibit federal, state, and local government agencies that receive federal adoption assistance funding from discriminating against child welfare service providers based on the providers’ unwillingness to take action contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs.
This would include all agencies that receive funding under Part B (Child and Family Services) or Part E (Federal Payments for Foster Care, Prevention, and Permanency) of Title IV of the Social Security Act.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces One Agency Act to Streamline and Improve Antitrust Enforcement
Date: March 9, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) reintroduced the One Agency Act Tuesday, legislation that would improve antitrust enforcement by putting all antitrust enforcement under one roof, at the Department of Justice. The updated bill will also prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from undertaking duplicative competitive analyses of deals under its purview. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and supported by several outside groups.
“For too long, our two-headed antitrust enforcement system has suffered from bureaucratic in-fighting, delays, redundancies, and inconsistency. Competition is too important to tolerate these problems any longer, especially when they allow sophisticated players to game the system to their own advantage and avoid accountability for engaging in anticompetitive behavior,”
Sen. Lee said
. “It’s time to right the ship by consolidating and strengthening our antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. The Department is more politically accountable, and its structure is better suited to the decisive enforcement we need to better protect American consumers.”
“I’m a strong proponent of antitrust enforcement, especially in the case of intellectual property protections,”
said Sen. Tillis
. “Antitrust has a valuable role to play in ensuring that Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter
can’t simply use their market power to steal creators’ content. But our current antitrust enforcement system—split between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission—simply isn’t working anymore. It hasn’t been for years. For too long, unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats at the FTC have pursued overly partisan enforcement actions which are entirely disconnected from economic reality. It’s past time that antitrust enforcement be handled solely by a politically accountable entity. I am proud to work with my colleagues on this long-overdue bill to ensure proper enforcement of antitrust laws through an improved, more streamlined process.”
Carl Szabo, Vice President & General Counsel of NetChoice,
commented, “At a time when populist progressives are threatening to overhaul our bipartisan antitrust consensus, Senator Lee is instead taking a serious approach to fixing real enforcement problems. His proposal would promote the rule of law, save taxpayer dollars, and provide certainty to businesses and consumers while preventing political infighting between federal agencies.”
Randolph May, President of the Free State Foundation
, said, “The part of the One Agency Act that prevents the FCC and state public utility commissions from duplicating the Department of Justice’s analysis of a transaction’s competitive effects makes eminent sense. And the bill’s limitations on the FCC’s invocation of its vague 'public interest’ authority, which the agency often has abused by imposing a multitude of conditions unrelated to any impact resulting from the proposed transaction, would constitute a significant improvement. Together, these two aspects of Senator Lee’s bill would constitute a meaningful reform of the review process applicable to transactions involving communications firms.”

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Lina Khan Nomination
Date: March 9, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Lee (R-Utah) issued the following statement this morning in response to news reports that President Biden plans to nominate Lina Khan to the Federal Trade Commission:
“If these reports are true, it is deeply concerning. Ms. Khan no doubt has a promising career ahead of her, but being less than four years out of law school, she lacks the experience necessary for such an important role as FTC Commissioner. Her views on antitrust enforcement are also wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law. Nominating Ms. Khan would signal that President Biden intends to put ideology and politics ahead of competent antitrust enforcement, which would be gravely disappointing at a time when it is absolutely critical that we have strong and effective leadership at the enforcement agencies. This moment is too important for our antitrust enforcers to be learning on the job.”

Title: Lee and Bipartisan Coalition Continue to Push for Larger Universal Charitable Deduction
Date: March 9, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) introduced the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act, a bipartisan proposal to extend and expand the universal charitable deduction. The bill would ensure that Americans who donate to non-profits such as charitable and religious organizations are able to deduct their giving from their federal tax liability at a higher level than the $300 deduction instituted temporarily through two of the COVID-19 relief packages.
More specifically, the Universal Giving Pandemic Response and Recovery Act would empower Americans who do not itemize on their tax returns to exclude a larger amount of their charitable giving from their taxable income—up to one-third the value of the standard deduction (which is about $4,000 for individuals and $8,000 for married couples filing jointly). This effort is in the same spirit as Senator Lee’s Social Capital Project within the Joint Economic Committee, which is focused on the importance of our associational life, enabled through institutions like churches, charities, and community partnerships. In fact, a 2019 report from the committee recommended a similar reform to help renew America’s voluntary institutions.
“Nonprofits fill the most acute needs in our communities, surpassing governmental efforts in responsiveness, dollar-for-dollar return on investment, and targeting acute and changing needs,”
said Senator Lee
. “During the pandemic, churches, charities, and community organizations have creatively met immense need in their neighborhoods, despite reports that many sources of donations have disappeared or decreased significantly.
“Last year, our bipartisan coalition paved the way for the creation of a charitable deduction for all American taxpayers. This year, we are again calling on Congress to increase that deduction to more than $4,000 for individuals and $8,000 for married couples. The charitable deduction has long embodied the insight that individuals should not be taxed on money they choose to give away. That maxim should hold irrespective of an individual’s total income,”
Lee concluded.
The bill is supported by many nonprofits, including: National Council of Nonprofits, Charitable Giving Coalition, The Philanthropy Roundtable, Faith and Giving Coalition, United Way Worldwide, National Philanthropic Trust, Association of Art Museum Directors, The Nonprofit Alliance, Council for Advancement and Support of Education, Alliance for Strong Families and Communities, American Red Cross, National Association of Evangelicals, Philanthropy Southwest, Council on Foundations, and Independent Sector.
Here’s what Utah supporters are saying:
“The proposed Universal Giving Pandemic Response Act is a critical piece of legislation that can have an immediate impact on our nonprofit ecosystem,”
said Jill Remington Love, Executive Director, Utah Department of Heritage and Arts
. “Coupled with the 2017 tax reforms, the pandemic and economic downturn over the past year have significantly reduced charitable giving at a time when demand for services has increased exponentially. Nonprofits urgently need additional resources to serve those most impacted through this current crisis.  Independent Sector-commissioned research indicates that the proposed legislation could unlock billions in new giving, providing a lifeline for struggling charities. Thank you to the bi-partisan sponsors for
working together
to champion this important issue.”
“Nonprofit organizations have, for years, been the bedrock of support and inspiration within our communities. We know that since 2017 the share of taxpayers who itemize (thus receiving an incentive for their charitable giving) has declined to approximately 10%. Additionally, the global pandemic has exacerbated an already fragile system where the needs of our communities are out pacing the availability of government and business support. Overall, this combination presents a challenge for Utah’s nonprofits because while giving and revenues have decreased the demand for services has increased,”
said Kate Rubalcava, Chief Executive Officer, Utah Nonprofits Association
. “A universal charitable giving incentive is a solid and worthy solution that not only benefits nonprofits, it also benefits communities and governments because nonprofits will have increased resources (from the community) fueling their mission critical work.”

Title: Utah Congressional Delegation Sends National Monuments Letter to President Biden
Date: March 9, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON
—U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Representatives Chris Stewart (R-UT), John Curtis (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Blake Moore (R-UT)
sent a letter
Friday to President Biden regarding the administration’s review of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. The letter requests the administration’s support in finding a permanent legislative solution for determining appropriate boundaries for the monuments, as well as statutory protections to prevent abuses under the
Antiquities Act
. It also requests that President Biden extend the 60-day review period timeline in order to allow the Secretary of the Interior time to travel to Utah, tour the monuments in question, and receive input from local stakeholders. After President Biden issued the January Executive Order, the delegation
urged the administration
to work with Congress toward a permanent legislative solution to the boundaries.
The
full text of the letter
is below:
We write to ask you for two things: (1) your administration's support and cooperation in seeking a permanent, legislative solution to the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, supported by a broad group of stakeholders, including elected officials, tribal governments, and other groups with interest in the management of these lands; and (2) an extension on the 60-day timeline you outlined in your Executive Order calling for a review of the monuments so as to allow the Secretary of the Interior to travel to Utah, tour the monuments in question, and get meaningful input from the local elected officials and residents who may otherwise be unheard.
In our letter to you, dated February 17, 2021, we indicated our readiness to engage as your Administration considers actions on the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. We again write to you today to reaffirm that readiness and request to meet with you directly, to discuss a legislative solution to codify appropriate boundaries to these national monuments and statutory protections from abuses under the Antiquities Act in the State of Utah. As demonstrated by the aforementioned letter, which was also signed by Utah’s Governor, Lieutenant Governor, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House, and Attorney General, there is widespread support for congressional action. We call upon you, and your administration, to support and engage in finding a long-term legislative solution and stop the vacillation of national monument boundaries in Utah. Various tribal leaders, environmental organizations, and Democratic members of Congress have expressed the need for permanent congressional legislation to protect this area. We remain prepared to work in good faith and hope you do as well.
A solution enacted by Congress could yield better results for all interested parties. The executive actions creating the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments did not effectively protect sensitive cultural resources or provide certainty in management of the lands.
Further unilateral, executive action under the Antiquities Act will result in the same shortcomings. We would much prefer a legislative solution. A legislative approach – if pursued with the support of the Utah delegation – would serve both the nation and our constituents. If successful, such an effort could help us end this historic cycle of disputes.
During the hearing regarding her pending nomination to be Secretary of the Interior, Representative Haaland committed to Senator Lee to come to Utah to meet and speak with those who are impacted by the monument designations and who understand the issue best. Unfortunately, time is running short to fulfil this commitment.
In your executive order, dated January 20, 2021, referred to as Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, you directed your Secretary of the Interior to conduct a review of “the monument boundaries and conditions that were established by Proclamation 9681 of December 4, 2017 (Modifying the Bears Ears National Monument),” and “Proclamation 9682 of December 4, 2017 (Modifying the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument),” as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the Antiquities Act, 54 U.S.C. 320301 et seq. This review is to be conducted within 60 days of the date of your order. That date is quickly approaching, and we believe it would be premature to have the Department of the Interior make a recommendation on the scope of these monuments without the process being overseen by a Senate-confirmed Secretary.
If the timeline is not extended, Representative Haaland, if confirmed, may have only days to consider the recommendations of the Department of the Interior, which she would then transmit to you, almost certainly eliminating the possibility for her to travel to Utah and meet with stakeholders who may otherwise be unheard. This recommendation, which could change the fate of millions of acres of land in Utah and uproot entire economies, is hardly a matter that can be decided in such a short period of time. This is especially true if the Secretary is unable to fulfil her commitment prior to issuing the review containing recommendations for action.
In summary, we ask to meet with you to begin the process of finding a legislative solution and to extend the date by which this review is to be completed in order to appropriately engage with those impacted. We are confident that your administration can achieve a better, and possibly historic result, with substantive input and engagement from Utah’s stakeholders. Furthermore, if a review is transmitted to you by the Department of the Interior prior to the confirmation of a Senate-confirmed Secretary, our state could be deprived of meaningful opportunities to engage with the Department’s senior-most official on this most pressing issue.
Thank you for your consideration. We appreciate and await your prompt response.

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Passage of COVID Package
Date: March 6, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) issued the following statement on the passage of the COVID spending package today in the Senate:
“For more than a year now, Congress has fought back against the COVID pandemic the same way the American people have: together.
“Five times, we crafted major COVID relief bills in a bipartisan process, and passed them with overwhelming bipartisan support. Today, Democrats abandoned that approach and instead passed a partisan grab bag of special interest handouts in the name of fighting a disease. This bloated, wasteful bill was not written for patients or businesses or workers suffering from COVID; it was written for the Democratic Party. It’s a shame and a sham.
“Throughout this difficult time, the American people have bravely held up their end. Today congressional Democrats dropped theirs.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Drone Integration and Zoning Act
Date: March 4, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced the Drone Integration and Zoning Act (DIZA), a bill to establish a regulatory framework for drones based on the principles of local governance and cooperative federalism.
“The FAA cannot feasibly or efficiently oversee millions of drones in every locality throughout the country,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Further,  its current legal position claiming regulatory authority over every cubic inch of air in the United States – including air just inches above Americans’ private property – is both unsustainable and unlawful. In our constitutional system, the states have sovereign police powers to govern over inherently local issues, including the protection of property, land use, privacy, trespass, and law enforcement. The best way to ensure public safety, protect property rights, and unleash drone innovation is to empower the people closest to the ground to make local decisions in real time, which is exactly what the Drone Integration and Zoning Act does.”
DIZA seeks to balance the competing airspace authorities between the federal government and the states by more clearly defining the boundaries of the FAA’s authority over the air as well as the proper scope of regulatory authority that federal and state governments exercise over drones operating in the United States. Specifically, it protects the authority of the states to issue time, place, and manner restrictions, while not unreasonably prohibiting access to the federal “navigable airspace”; and it protects the local zoning authority of state, local, or tribal governments to designate commercial drone take-off and landing zones, while still allowing for interstate commerce.

Date: March 4, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Todd Young (R-Ind.) to send a letter to President Biden urging his administration to reject an upcoming proposal at the World Trade Organization that would strip American companies of their intellectual property rights for any innovation related to COVID-19.
In part, the senators wrote:
“India, South Africa, and other countries are presenting a proposal at the World Trade Organization to waive all intellectual property rights for any innovation related to COVID-19. The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing COVID-19 vaccines.
“But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments we would be ending the progress—started under Operation Warp Speed—that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history.”

“The Commerce Committee and the Special Committee on Aging are tackling huge issues that will define our economy and society for years to come. And, finally, as the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, I will continue the JEC staff’s critical work on the crises in American social capital.”
Sen. Lee will once again serve as the Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, and on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining.
In addition, Sen. Lee will continue to lead Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee as Ranking Republican, after spending the last two Congresses as Vice Chairman and Chairman, respectively. He will also continue his service on the Senate Commerce Committee.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Childcare Worker Opportunity Act
Date: March 2, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced the Childcare Worker Opportunity Act, a bill to repeal burdensome District of Columbia licensing requirements for childcare workers. The bill is cosponsored by Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and house companion legislation is sponsored by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C).
In December of 2016, the District of Columbia issued regulations requiring certain childcare workers to have either an associate or bachelor’s degree, depending on the type of child care they provide.
“These regulations disproportionately harm low-income families and will further drive up childcare costs, making it more difficult for anyone except the wealthy to afford child care,”
said Sen. Lee.
“My bill would repeal these harmful and unnecessary regulations, ensuring that experienced childcare workers aren’t forced out of their jobs. Repealing these regulations would also help provide more affordable, flexible childcare for District families, which is needed now more than ever.”
“It is absolutely ludicrous those who wish to care for children have to obtain a college degree to do so,”
said Rep. Mace.
“Yet this is exactly the case in Washington, D.C. As a member of the Oversight Committee, which oversees the governance of the Federal City, it’s my job to provide sensible solutions to those struggling in our nation’s capital. Unemployment in D.C. is almost in the double-digits, and parents pay more and wait longer for child care in D.C. than anywhere else in the country. My bill with Senator Lee repeals this absurd regulation, giving parents affordable child care options while providing greater work opportunities for those who wish to care for children.”
Under Article I of the Constitution, Congress has the power to exercise legislative authority over the District of Columbia. The bill would assert that authority to repeal D.C. regulations requiring childcare workers to possess an
associate degree, a bachelor’s degree, or any college credits in order to provide child care in the District.
See support from outside organizations below:
“Childcare workers and parents are both hurt by ridiculous regulations on daycare centers, like those in Washington, DC, which require that all childcare workers have college degrees as a condition of employment. The Childcare Worker Opportunity Act would provide relief by rolling back that regulation. This is great news for parents struggling to pay for care and also for qualified, patient, and caring people working in the childcare sector.”
-- Carrie Lukas, President, Independent Women’s Voice
“Washington, D.C. has the highest cost of child care in the nation. These regulations serve to further increase the cost and reduce the accessibility of child care, while also burdening
childcare workers with unnecessary debt. I'm grateful to see Senator Lee and Representative Mace for working towards addressing these challenges.”
-- Shoshana Weissmann, Fellow, R Street Institute
"Parents don't need a college degree to raise a child. So why should childcare workers require a degree to take care of a child? The District of Columbia's requirement that certain childcare providers obtain an associate or bachelor's degree is absurd, and unfortunately, it is likely responsible for barring otherwise qualified childcare workers from earning a living, as well as driving up the overall cost of child care. During a pandemic when so many are struggling to find good work – and so many parents are struggling to find affordable, flexible care for their children – licensing requirements like those of the District are especially cruel. Sen. Lee's Childcare Worker Opportunity Act is a compassionate and commonsense measure to help working families, and APP fully endorses it."

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Protect State Water Rights
Date: March 2, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) yesterday introduced the State Water Rights Protection Act, a bill to prevent presidents from unilaterally creating reserved water rights when designating national monuments, as allowed under current law. As the size and scope of national monuments have significantly grown over time, often without the approval of a state and its inhabitants, these designations can impact, and in some cases terminate, privately held water rights.
“States with vast swaths of federal land at risk of monument designation need a reliable water supply for their residents, especially in the arid West,”
said Sen. Lee.
“This bill will ensure that states are not denied their existing local water rights when a national monument is designated.”
The State Water Rights Protection Act would amend current law to prevent a president from creating a reserved water right when designating a national monument, though it would not prevent a president from creating a national monument itself. Additionally, it would allow for water rights to be acquired for a national monument through the state system in which the water rights reside.

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Urge CDC to Help Reopen Schools
Date: March 1, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) on Friday led his colleagues in sending a letter to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky regarding their concerns about continued school closures and their harmful effects on children, parents, and the economy, as documented in recent research. In light of scientific research showing low community transmission in schools, especially among younger children, the letter also calls on the CDC to revise its guidelines to help schools reopen.
“We write to express our concern for the well-being of American families with school-aged children. A fully remote or hybrid model of K-12 education is straining the mental health of parents, students, and teachers while simultaneously increasing developmental, learning, and economic losses.
…
“Dr. Fauci has affirmed that ‘the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school or to get them back to school…. If you look at the data the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected.’
…
“If the reopening of schools is not achieved, American families and students will only continue to suffer, as there will be even larger developmental, learning, and economic losses.
We ask that the CDC revise these recommendations, and urge you and other acting administration officials to work in coordination with, not against, states and local education agencies so that schools can promptly reopen in accord with the scientific evidence that has signaled it is safe to do so when proper precautionary measures are put into place.”
Cosigners of the letter include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).

Title: Sen. Lee, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Permanently Ban Earmarks
Date: March 1, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today joined Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), along with several of their colleagues, to introduce legislation to permanently ban earmarks. This follows a partisan agreement between Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro to bring the practice back to Congress.
“Banning earmarks in 2011 was the first step in reforming Congress’s dysfunctional budget process. Much more work needs to be done, but backsliding into the corrupt and corrupting earmarks racket should not be an option,”
Sen.
Lee said.
Earmarks do nothing but add to the toxic, swampy culture that DC's known for,"
Sen.
Daines said.
"These back-room deals promote pay-for-play behavior that make lobbyists rich on the taxpayer’s dime. It’s time we get rid of earmarks once and for all.”
Earmarks are a way to direct discretionary funds to specific recipients without going through a merit-based or competitive allocation process. In 2019, a Republican controlled Senate banned earmarks.
Other cosponsors of the bill include Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.)

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Syria Airstrike
Date: February 26, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) issued the following statement in response to the Biden administration’s airstrike in Syria last night:
“The decision to launch an airstrike in Syria without authorization from Congress is concerning, but frankly not surprising. In recent history, presidents of both political parties have shown little restraint in using military force despite the Constitution’s explicit delegation of the war-making power to Congress.
“In this instance, given the ample lead time prior to the strike and the lack of an authorization for the use of military force for activities in Syria, the Biden administration owes Congress a thorough report required under the War Powers Act. I look forward to promptly reviewing the administration’s legal justification for the strike, the nature of reported imminent threats to U.S. security that necessitated an offensive response, and constraints that prevented seeking authorization from Congress.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Moran, and Braun Introduce PROMISE Act to Hold Big Tech Accountable
Date: February 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) yesterday introduced the Promoting Responsibility Over Moderation In the Social Media Environment (PROMISE) Act, a bill designed to hold Big Tech companies accountable for their promises to not operate their social medial platforms with political bias.
The billionaires who own our nation’s Big Tech companies have every right to be partisan political actors,”
Sen. Lee said.
“They do not have the right to tell consumers that they will provide unbiased platforms, and then use those same platforms to discriminate against Americans with opposing religious, philosophical, or political viewpoints.
“Social media platforms that promise to be free and open marketplaces of ideas should abide by these assurances,”
said Sen. Moran.
“This legislation would hold Big Tech companies accountable for not following their own content moderation policies which prevent them from unfairly discriminating against groups and individuals for their political beliefs.”
“It’s wrong for Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg and others in the Big Tech community to falsely claim their platforms are unbiased and then censor conservatives, and the PROMISE Act will finally hold Silicon Valley accountable,”
said Sen. Braun.
Specifically,
the PROMISE Act
would:
Require a “covered entity” to implement, operate, and disclose information moderation policies that explain the standards, processes, and policies regarding its moderation of information provided by a user or other information content provider. Such policy must include:
Categories of information not permitted on its service or subject to moderation by users or the entity itself
The process used in moderating content
The notification process (if any) utilized to inform users of a moderation action taken, the rationale for the moderation decision, and options for redress (if any)
Prohibits a “covered entity” from making a “deceptive policy statement” with respect to its information moderation policy. A “deceptive policy statement” carries with it a rebuttable presumption that a statement is material and likely to cause injury.
Make violations of the requirements to implement, operate, or disclose an “information moderation policy” or to not make a “deceptive policy statement” constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)).

Title: ICYMI: Sen. Lee’s Breakdown of the Lee-Rubio Child Tax Credit Plan
Date: February 24, 2021

Content:
“Government policy should recognize families’ indispensable contributions to our nation’s long-term health and prosperity. And families should not face a penalty if one parent chooses to stay home with his or kids.
The Lee-Rubio plan would help address the parent penalty by nearly doubling the Child Tax Credit. The plan would also eliminate the stay-at-home parent penalty by turning the childcare credit into a ‘young child’ enhancement that families of all stripes can access.
With $4,500 for young children and $3,500 for children ages six to 17, every family would be better off.
Let’s ensure that families are treated fairly by our tax code.”

Title: Sen. Lee Sets Senate Republican Antitrust Agenda for 117th Congress
Date: February 16, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Upon being assigned the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee issued the following statement today on antitrust matters in the 117th Congress:
“Antitrust law and policy continues to grab headlines and attract attention in Congress, and there appears to be a broad consensus that the status quo isn’t working. With the Senate split 50-50, any effort to reform or update our antitrust laws will need to be a bipartisan effort with buy-in from both sides. I look forward to playing a leading role in that process, including by reintroducing the One Agency Act with new provisions to address the inequities of FCC merger review. I appreciate Sen. Klobuchar’s opening contribution to this bipartisan discussion, and am excited to work through the details with her and others to reach a consensus approach to improving antitrust enforcement for the 21st century.
“We have much to address. The actions of Big Tech continue to divide the nation, undermine fundamental liberties, and distort the market. The Silicon Valley fairytale of innovation and technological progress sold to Americans has turned into a corporatist nightmare of censorship and hypocrisy.
“For over two centuries, conservatives have echoed the voices of America’s founding fathers, warning of the danger of concentrated political power. The greatest threat to liberty has always been state coercion.
“This remains true, but increasingly that threat is rivaled by another: the soft totalitarianism of a corporate shadow state. It is not the government’s monopoly on force that today’s left uses to punish wrong think, but the economic monopolies of multinational corporations. While the means are different, the effect may in some cases be the same.
“We now see forming before our very eyes a world in which the massive tech companies that facilitate so much of our daily lives are no longer content simply to profit off of us; they want also to control what information we are allowed to access.
“As the leading Republican on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee for the last decade, I have repeatedly warned of the dangers posed by Big Tech. But despite those warnings, our antitrust enforcers were asleep at the wheel while Silicon Valley transformed from a center of innovation into a center of acquisition. Instead of competing to be the next Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon, today’s tech startups are pushed by their private-equity backers to sell out to Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon.
“Innovation is supposed to benefit consumers by challenging the market incumbents, not strengthening their monopoly power. But this works only when there is adequate antitrust enforcement, rather than laissez-faire deference to the sort of speculative efficiencies Judge Bork warned against in
The Antitrust Paradox
. Everyone knows that illicitly obtained monopolies lead to higher prices and lower quality for consumers. Now we are seeing that, unchecked, they can also threaten our most basic liberties.
“At the same time, some of my colleagues across the aisle would seize this moment to radically alter our antitrust enforcement regime in a manner that would undermine both the economy and Congress’s legislative prerogative.
“The consumer welfare standard—which ensures that the primary beneficiaries of the antitrust laws are the people, rather than big business—is essential to maintaining free markets. It is also essential to preventing unelected judges from advancing their private political preferences by applying the antitrust laws to non-economic harms. Put another way, it prevents judges from usurping Congress’s legislative role.
“The consumer welfare standard also conforms antitrust law to basic doctrines of fairness and equality under the law. Rather than simply declaring that ‘big is bad’, antitrust law—properly applied—looks to conduct and its effect on consumers in the same way that other laws judge a person’s conduct and not their status. Straying from these guiding principles would cripple our economy at a time when millions are already struggling, and it would undermine one of the foundational principles of our republic.
“For those reasons, any legislative attempt to replace or undermine the consumer welfare standard is a non-starter. It’s also unnecessary. Our current laws are more than up to the task of policing the anticompetitive conduct that has left so many markets bereft of competition. Make no mistake: the consumer welfare standard is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for any business if properly enforced. Our time and resources will be much better spent ensuring that we are adequately enforcing existing laws, rather than pursuing drastic changes with unintended consequences that could wreak havoc on the economy.
“In addition to legislation, it is crucial that Congress continue to exercise its investigative and oversight functions by examining competition throughout the economy. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in both houses of Congress, to look into issues such as:
How pandemic lockdowns harmed competition by killing small businesses;
How competition in healthcare markets is distorted by the Affordable Care Act and other government regulations;
The relationship between antitrust law and patent law, including in the standard-setting context;
Whether vertical integration among media and telecom companies is restricting innovation or output;
Whether app stores owners are restricting competition from developers; and
Competition issues in finance, including whether large private equity firms that hold stakes in competing businesses are distorting competition in those markets.
“There are many more topics one could list. I’m open to them all. We are at an inflection point, and it is crucial that we not waste it.”

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Acquittal of Former President Trump
Date: February 13, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today issued the following statement after the Senate’s acquittal of former President Donald Trump.
“The House managers’ burden in this trial was to prove first, that the Senate should exercise its impeachment jurisdiction in a case against a former president; and second, that he committed the high crime of inciting an insurrection. The House managers did not clear either hurdle.
"No one can condone the horrific violence that occurred on January 6, 2021–or President Trump’s words, actions, and omissions on that day. I certainly do not.
“But, the fact is that the word ‘incitement’ has a very specific meaning in the law, and Donald Trump’s words and actions on January 6, 2021, fell short of that standard. The House rushed its impeachment without an investigation, charged President Trump with a crime it failed properly to allege, and then sat on its poorly worded Article until after he left office.
“Given the politically suspicious process, the Senate should never have exercised jurisdiction over this Article in the first place. Convicting a former official would be an unprecedented and constitutionally dubious step—never before has the Senate convicted an impeached official after that official has left office. The House managers never demonstrated why that step was necessary in this case.
“On the contrary, throughout the trial, the House managers repeatedly relied on hearsay, erroneous media reports, and political rhetoric rather than evidence.
“Faced with the weak presentation of a deficient case demanding unprecedented constitutional action against a private citizen, acquittal was the only option I could deem consistent with the law, the facts, and the Constitution.”

Title: Sens. Lee, King Introduce Bill to Strengthen American Manufacturing
Date: February 10, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Angus King (I-Maine) on Monday introduced the Reinforcing American-Made Products Act, a bill that strengthens American manufacturing by creating one national “Made in USA” labeling standard.
“Now more than ever, Americans care about the ‘Made in USA’ label; and they should because it shows consumers a product is of high quality and supports good jobs here in America,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Unfortunately, some states have made it unnecessarily difficult  for businesses to use the ‘Made in USA’ label and empowered trial lawyers to get rich through differing labeling standards. This bill solves that problem by making one national standard for the ‘Made in USA’ label.”
“When a consumer sees a ‘Made in the USA’ label, they know they’re purchasing a high-quality product and supporting American jobs,”
said Senator King.
“These labels are simple, straightforward ways to help consumers make informed decisions – but confusing differences in state regulations prevent too many American manufacturers from using them. I’m proud to work with Sen. Lee to streamline this process and provide clarity for consumers who want to support American workers and manufacturers.”
The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would ensure that the federal government maintains authority in setting country-of-origin labeling standards and that states do not create a patchwork of different standards governing interstate and exported goods. One state has complicated our country standard, setting a rigid 100 percent threshold and exposing manufacturers to unnecessary litigation. The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would fix that by creating one national standard.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Resolution to Protect D.C. Parents’ Rights, Children’s Health
Date: February 8, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced a congressional Joint Resolution disapproving of the District of Columbia government’s recently passed “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendments Act of 2020.” The law would allow children as young as 11-years old to consent to vaccinations without their parents’ knowledge – a dangerous violation of parental rights and children’s health.
“The D.C. government’s vaccination bill is a threat to District children, their families, and the entire community,”
Sen. Lee said.
“Young children do not know their medical histories, potential allergies, or possess adult
judgment, which is the whole point of having parents make healthcare decisions on behalf of their kids. This new law goes so far as to hide children’s medical vaccinations from their own parents. Congress has the responsibility of overseeing District policymaking, and to protect parents’ rights and children’s health, we should exercise that authority by disapproving this dangerous mistake.”
The “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act of 2020” would strip District of Columbia parents of their rights to make vaccination decisions for their children, and require doctors, nurses, insurance companies, and even public schools to conceal children’s vaccinations from their parents. The D.C. Home Rule Act gives Congress 30 days after passage of certain legislation by the D.C. City Council to disapprove of that legislation, thereby precluding its implementation. The Joint Resolution of Disapproval, if passed, would strike down the proposed law.
Cosponsors include: Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).
Reps. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) and Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) are introducing the companion measure in the House.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Member of the Joint Economic Committee, today released the following statement in response to the U.S. Labor Department January 2021 jobs report:
“The first month of the new year brings news of 49,000 jobs added in January. With more Americans finding work and getting vaccinated, we are now closer than ever before to moving beyond the pandemic. As more of the economy fully reopens, America is poised to gain millions of jobs back this year that were lost to COVID-19, and indications suggest we are at the beginning of a streak of good news.”

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Legislation to Protect Women’s Sports
Date: February 5, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) yesterday led 13 of his colleagues in introducing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation that would protect athletic opportunities for female athletes.
“When transgender athletes compete against women, women’s sports are no longer women’s sports; they become unisex athletic events,”
Sen. Lee
said. “This bill would protect the opportunity of girls throughout America to athletically compete against other girls.”
"As a doctor and a former coach, I find it un-American to allow biological boys to compete against biological girls when it comes to athletics. Growing up, sports taught me that there was a level playing field and that we all had equal opportunity to compete and win,” said
Sen. Marshall
. "Letting biological boys compete in biological girls’ high school and college sports is not equal, it doesn’t level the playing field, and it’s certainly not fair. I want every person, regardless of sex, to have access to opportunity, but this move by the Biden Administration shows no common sense and will bring about the destruction of women’s sports."
“In light of the recent push by Democrats to ignore biological science, I am proud to cosponsor this bill to protect women and girls’ right to play sports on their own terms, without fear of being forced to compete against biological men,”
Sen. Cruz
said
.
“Sadly, this commonsense legislation will likely be opposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Regardless of political correctness, Congress should support fair athletic competition and opportunity for girls and boys alike.”
“Female athletes deserve a fair chance at competition—this means fair victories and fair defeats,” said
Sen. Blackburn
. “Allowing males to compete in women’s sports denies female student athletes a level playing field to compete and achieve.”
“As a former track runner myself, I know the values, perseverance and teamwork you gain from playing a sport,”
Sen. Inhofe
said. “I think about my granddaughters—who all grew up playing sports—having to compete against individuals born as males. We are all equal, but we are not all the same and we need this action to protect the future of women’s sports. I am glad to join Sen. Lee’s bill today to protect athletic competition for all girls, just like my granddaughters.”
Specifically, the bill would ensure that Title IX provisions relating to athletics treat sex as that which is "recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth." Further, if any recipient of federal funding who operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs or activities permits a male to participate in a women's sporting event, they would be found to be violation of the statutory regulations outlined in Title IX.
The full list of cosponsors includes: Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).
Outside organizations in support of the bill include: Concerned Women for American (CWA), American Principles Project (APP), Family Research Council (FRC), Ethics & Public Policy Center (EPPC), Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), Save Women’s Sports, Heritage Action for America (HAFA), Independent Women’s Forum (IWF), United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Family Policy Alliance, and Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF).

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on “Vote-a-Rama” and Passage of HSA Amendment
Date: February 5, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today commented on last night’s Senate budget “vote-a-rama” session, during which three Lee amendments were voted on, including passage of his amendment expanding Americans’ access to Health Savings Accounts.
“Last night was what the Senate should look like all the time,”
Sen. Lee said.
“We debated and voted up-or-down on dozens of amendments offered by Senators from both parties.”
Three of those amendments were offered by Sen. Lee:
Amendment #821, affirming the First Amendment’s protection of Americans’ religious liberty, which failed 50-50;
Amendment #770, protecting jobs and royalty revenues created by oil and gas leases from new regulations designed to cripple the American energy industry;
Amendment #253, expanding access to and qualifications for health savings accounts, which could include increasing HSA contribution limits, and including dietary and nutritional supplements among HSA-qualified medical expenses, which passed 53-47 with bipartisan support and was included in the final budget.
“I am thrilled that a bipartisan majority in the Senate is now on record supporting expanded health savings accounts. HSAs are extremely effective, popular, and cost-effective. They are what real health care reform looks like, and passage of my amendment is an exciting step for American healthcare.”
“Though I opposed the Democrats’ final budget for spending and borrowing too much and reforming too little – I hope last night’s marathon voting session is a sign that the Senate is finally ready to start working again.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Working Families Flexibility Act
Date: February 4, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act, a bill that would give employees more flexibility on how to use their overtime benefits. Sen. Lee was joined by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), along with eleven of their colleagues.
“For many families, especially those with young children, their most precious commodity is time with each other – and that has never been more challenging to balance with work than during the current pandemic,”
said Sen. Lee
. “For decades, federal labor laws have unfortunately restricted the way parents and workers can use their time, while giving special exemptions from these laws to government employees. This is unacceptable: the same work-life options available to government employees should be available to private-sector workers as well, especially during these challenging times.”
“Working parents provide for their families, make ends meet, and take care of all the responsibilities that come with maintaining a household,”
Sen. Capito said
. “Those responsibilities also mean the time spent with their children is all the more important. The Working Families Flexibility Act would lift restrictions on private-sector workers and afford them the same options government workers have when it comes to using their overtime benefits. Now more than ever, moms and dads need the flexibility to maintain this work-life balance at home.”
In 1978, Congress passed the “Federal Employee Flexible and Compressed Work Schedule Act,” providing federal, state, and local governments the ability to give their employees a choice between overtime pay or paid time off for working overtime hours. This legal privilege unfairly discriminates against private-sector workers and impedes those employers who want to offer their employees this flexibility to balance work and family obligations.
The Working Families Flexibility Act fixes this disparity by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide employers with the necessary flexibility to allow their employees to choose either the traditional overtime pay or paid time off for any overtime hours worked.
Other cosponsors include: Senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.), James Risch (R-Idaho), John Barasso (R-Wyo.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).

Title: Lee, Rubio Statement on Child Tax Credit

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) released a joint statement on new proposals to further expand the Child Tax Credit, which they successfully
expanded
in 2017 and tax return data
confirmed
has had a positive effect on millions of American families:
“We are encouraged by recent proposals to increase tax relief for working families. Upon our initiative, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the Child Tax Credit and expanded its eligibility to provide significant tax cuts to working parents with children.
“We have long said that the Child Tax Credit must be further increased to help working families. In the current pandemic relief bill under consideration, we would support increasing the Child Tax Credit to $3,500, and $4,500 for young children.
“However, we do not support turning the Child Tax Credit into what has been called a ‘child allowance,’ paid out as a universal basic income to all parents. That is not tax relief for working parents; it is welfare assistance.
“An essential part of being pro-family is being pro-work. Congress should expand the Child Tax Credit without undercutting the responsibility of parents to work to provide for their families.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces ARTICLE ONE Act to Reclaim Congressional Power
Date: February 4, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced the ARTICLE ONE Act, a bill that would reclaim significant legislative powers delegated to the executive branch by the National Emergencies Act of 1976.
When Congress passed this act in 1976, it gave the president of the United States the ability to exercise unilateral power like a king. Now, more than 40 years later, there are 37 ongoing national emergencies that have no congressional approval or expiration date. And just last week, the majority leader pointed out that the president “can do many, many things under the emergency powers . . . that he could do without legislation,” and suggested that “[i]t might be a good idea for President Biden to call a climate emergency.”
“This kind of lawmaking-by-proclamation runs directly counter to the vision of our Founders and undermines the safeguards protecting our freedom,” Sen. Lee said. “It’s high time that Congress reclaimed its legislative power and restored constitutional balance to our Republic.”
The ARTICLE ONE Act would automatically end all future emergency declarations made pursuant to the NEA after 30 days unless Congress affirmatively votes to extend the emergency. Currently, Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto.
The bill’s full name is the “Assuring that Robust, Thorough, and Informed Congressional Leadership is Exercised Over National Emergencies Act.”
It is cosponsored by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Cancel the Coin Act to Eliminate Debt Limit Loophole
Date: February 3, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after introducing the Cancel the Coin Act earlier this week. The bill would remove the Treasury Secretary’s ability to mint coins of any value.
“If the current budget resolution shows anything, it is that this Administration does not see the ballooning federal deficit as a problem,” Sen. Lee said. “A modern monetary theory-inspired spending spree would be disastrous for the American economy and the American way of life.
“The Cancel the Coin Act removes a legal loophole that allows the Treasury Secretary to bypass the statutory borrowing limit by minting platinum coins of any denomination. In doing so, this legislation ensures the powers to coin money and regulate the value thereof remain firmly in the branch of government in which the Constitution bestows them: Congress.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Parental Rights Bills
Date: February 3, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Parental Accessibility Rights for Emergency and Negligent Treatment (PARENT) Act and the Parental Right to Know Act Wednesday, a pair of bills designed to ensure that parents have access to the policies regarding the care and medical records of their children from hospitals and organizations that use taxpayer funding.
“Parents play the most important role in caring for the health of their children,” Sen. Lee said. “It is critical that they have information about the policies of the health organizations to which they bring their children for care, and that they have the ability to access their medical records. These bills would ensure that parents are afforded the right to remain informed and involved in their children’s care.”
Current law lacks transparency about parental rights regarding both the suspension of care and access to medical records from institutions that use CHIP or Medicaid funds. The result has been that some children have stopped receiving care without the consent of their parents, even resulting in death in some cases; and that parents have also been denied access to their children’s medical records in some cases.
The PARENT Act would require any hospital, clinic, or healthcare facility that receives Medicaid or CHIP funds to include information on their website and in print, upon request by the patient or parent, on the following: policies related to the provision, withdrawal, or denial of life-sustaining procedures, nutrition, or medication; policies related to parental consent of these services; and policies related to the required notification of parents and parental consent for a “do-not-resuscitate” order.
The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mike Braun (R-IN).
The Parental Right to Know Act would require any hospital, clinic, or healthcare facility that receives Medicaid or CHIP funds to include the information on parental access to medical records of minors under the age of 18 on their website and in print, upon request of the patient or parent.
It is co-sponsored by Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Mike Braun (R-IN).

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after voting against the motion to proceed on a budget resolution:
“The $2 trillion dollar Biden stimulus package that the Democrats are starting to ram through this week has nothing to do with recovery from COVID and everything to do with bailing out and rewarding interest groups.”
“A $15 minimum wage is great for Big Tech companies like Amazon, but it is a job killer for small businesses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a $15 minimum wage would force 1.3 million people out of work. How does killing jobs help the economy?”
“The Biden Bailout also includes over $400 billion for state and local governments. This Biden bailout would go straight to wasteful Democratic states like California that have not been honestly funding their retirement systems for decades.”
“I am going to do everything I can this week to make sure that the next COVID spending bill is as fair to Utahns as possible.”

“The economy demonstrated enduring strength in the final quarter of 2020, and this news should be applauded in the midst of the ongoing pandemic. GDP grew at a pace of 4.0 percent, personal income remained above pre-pandemic levels, and Americans are saving more. For the economy to fully recover, however, Americans and their families must feel completely safe resuming the activities they do together. As medical professionals in the United States continue administering life-saving vaccines and treatments, I hope that consumer confidence will continue rising and that we will soon be able to return to the in-person activities that connect us.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Pro-Life Legislation
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced three pieces of pro-life legislation: the Abortion is not Health Care Act, the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act, and the Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act.
“Each human life, born and unborn, has immeasurable dignity and worth. The lives of both an unborn baby
and
her mother matter; and healthcare should heal, protect, and preserve
both
their lives. Our laws and use of taxpayer money should reflect that truth, which is why I have introduced these bills,” Sen. Lee said.
The
Abortion is not Health Care Act
would end the tax deductibility of abortions and clarify that this gruesome practice is not health care. Currently, the IRS categorizes an abortion as “medical care” and allows tax benefits to flow to this immoral practice, subsidizing the killing of hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year. This bill would amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit elective abortion expenses from being considered eligible for a medical expense deduction.
Cosponsors include: Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Kennedy (R-LA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rand Paul (R-KY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tim Scott (R-SC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).
The
Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts
would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion in health savings accounts. Current law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds from health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts for the “medical expense” of abortion. This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to explicitly prevent abortions from getting a special tax-advantage through use of these accounts.
Cosponsors include: Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).
The
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act
would ensure that our foreign aid is not funding or promoting abortions overseas. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City Policy, prohibiting the availability of family planning foreign assistance funds to organizations that provide or promote abortions, or advocate to change abortion laws in a foreign country. Since then, the policy has been alternately rescinded and reinstated with changing administrations.
The Trump Administration reinstated and expanded this policy, renaming it the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy. This bill would permanently codify an expanded version of this policy into law. With President Biden poised to rescind the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, it is crucial that Congress act to codify it. Doing so would affirm the dignity of unborn human lives everywhere, and save countless lives across the globe.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on 4th Quarter Economic Growth
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday in response to the Department of Commerce’s 4th Quarter Gross Domestic Product estimate.
“The economy demonstrated enduring strength in the final quarter of 2020, and this news should be applauded in the midst of the ongoing pandemic. GDP grew at a pace of 4.0 percent, personal income remained above pre-pandemic levels, and Americans are saving more. For the economy to fully recover, however, Americans and their families must feel completely safe resuming the activities they do together. As medical professionals in the United States continue administering life-saving vaccines and treatments, I hope that consumer confidence will continue rising and that we will soon be able to return to the in-person activities that connect us.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Pro-Life Legislation
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced three pieces of pro-life legislation: the Abortion is not Health Care Act, the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act, and the Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act.
“Each human life, born and unborn, has immeasurable dignity and worth. The lives of both an unborn baby
and
her mother matter; and healthcare should heal, protect, and preserve
both
their lives. Our laws and use of taxpayer money should reflect that truth, which is why I have introduced these bills,” Sen. Lee said.
The
Abortion is not Health Care Act
would end the tax deductibility of abortions and clarify that this gruesome practice is not health care. Currently, the IRS categorizes an abortion as “medical care” and allows tax benefits to flow to this immoral practice, subsidizing the killing of hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year. This bill would amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit elective abortion expenses from being considered eligible for a medical expense deduction.
Cosponsors include: Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Kennedy (R-LA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rand Paul (R-KY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tim Scott (R-SC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Ben Sasse (R-NE).
The
Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts
would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion in health savings accounts. Current law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds from health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts for the “medical expense” of abortion. This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to explicitly prevent abortions from getting a special tax-advantage through use of these accounts.

The
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act
would ensure that our foreign aid is not funding or promoting abortions overseas. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City Policy, prohibiting the availability of family planning foreign assistance funds to organizations that provide or promote abortions, or advocate to change abortion laws in a foreign country.

Title: Sen. Lee Joins Effort to End Taxpayer Funded Abortions
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, today joined an effort led by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., to reintroduce the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which would make permanent the Hyde Amendment restrictions on using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.
“The government should not endorse, nor should taxpayers subsidize, a practice that kills hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year. This bill would thankfully end that, and would help us move towards a culture of life upheld in our laws and through our taxpayer dollars,”
Lee
said.
“Using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions is wrong,”
Wicker
said. “Millions of American taxpayers believe unborn life deserves protection in the womb. I am glad to join so many of my colleagues to introduce this legislation, which would guarantee taxpayers that their money will never support the taking of innocent human life.”
Currently, policies that regulate federal funding for abortions, like the long-standing Hyde Amendment, have to be reapproved each year and can be terminated at any time. This bill would eliminate the need for annual action and ensure a permanent, government-wide prohibition on funding for abortions.
In addition to establishing a government-wide ban on federal funding for abortion, the legislation would:
Prohibit funding for health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion with funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law;
Prohibit abortion in federal health facilities (such as DOD and VA hospitals) and ensure that no federal employee provides abortion services in the course of their employment;
Make permanent the provisions of the D.C. Hyde Amendment, or the Dornan Amendment, which clarifies that the federal provisions regarding abortion funding also apply to the government of the District of Columbia;
Ensure that elective abortion is not deductible for tax purposes by amending Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
Ensure that Affordable Care Act premium assistance subsidies provided in the form of refundable, advanceable tax credits are not used to pay for health insurance plans that include abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.
Lee and Wicker were joined by 45 other senators, including: John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Roy Blunt, R-Mo., John Boozman, R-Ark., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., Bill Cassidy, R-La., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., John Hoeven, R-N.D., Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., John Kennedy, R-La., James Lankford, R-Okla., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Jerry Moran, R-Kan., Rand Paul, R-Ky., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, James Risch, R-Idaho, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Tim Scott, R-S.C., Richard Shelby, R-Ala., Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, John Thune, R-S.D., Tom Tillis, R-N.C., Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., and Todd Young, R-Ind.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces PPP Protection Legislation
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday after introducing legislation earlier in the week to ease the regulatory burden on banks participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
“The Paycheck Protection Program has become an essential vehicle for protecting millions of small businesses and hundreds of millions of jobs. The CFPB's unauthorized attacks on banks participating in this program are putting all of these businesses and jobs at risk. Congress needs to act now to prevent CFPB meddling from creating any further delay in PPP lending and loan forgiveness,” Sen. Lee said.
Congress designed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to be a lifeline program that relied on already existing infrastructure in the Small Business Administration and America’s lending institutions. The nation’s banks and other lenders answered the call by rapidly delivering liquidity to firms. Participation in the program was not easy; PPP was a new program with a difficult and evolving roll-out. America’s lenders nevertheless stepped up.
In order to ensure that haste was balanced with scrupulous review of the issuance of these lifeline loans, Congress appropriated additional money for the inspector general of the Small Business Administration to conduct oversight of these loans and verify that they went to legitimate businesses and were used for legitimate ends.
However, nowhere, did Congress authorize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to investigate banks for issuing these loans. Despite the CFPB’s clear and limited statutory role as a bureau protecting the finances of consumers, CFPB has taken it upon itself to scrutinize banks by initiating prioritized assessments for lenders that participated in PPP. CFPB has required banks to respond in a short time frame with detailed information on their involvement in PPP – including all the data on loans they have processed, the demographics of borrowers, loan forgiveness, etc. These assessments have no statutory ground, are a duplicative regulatory burden on our banks, and have impaired the rapid deployment of further PPP support and new second-draw loans.

Title: Lee and Romney Join Effort to Prevent President from Unilaterally Suspending Energy Leases on Federal Lands
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined their colleagues, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), in introducing the
Protecting our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act of 2021
. The
POWER Act
would prohibit the president or his secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Energy departments from blocking energy or mineral leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters without Congressional approval. Text of the legislation can be found
here
.
“President Biden’s energy moratorium has already done considerable damage to Utah’s economy. President’s should not have the unilateral power to kill jobs like this. The
POWER Act
will check the president’s power by giving Congress a say in future leasing disruptions,”
Sen. Lee said
.
“The economic impacts of the suspension of oil and gas leasing on federal lands will be devastating to Utah’s rural communities, tribes, and small businesses,"
Sen. Romney said.
"And they will be detrimental to Utah’s energy industry, which is struggling to stay afloat and keep Utahns employed during the pandemic. Long-term decisions or pauses to energy leases should be considered and approved by Congress, not by the stroke of a pen through executive order.”
The
POWER Act
is also cosponsored by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), Roger Marshall (R-KS), James Risch (R-ID), Dan Sullivan (R-AK) Pat Toomey (R-PA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on President Biden’s Job Killing Energy Order
Date: January 28, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday, after President Biden signed an executive order halting oil and gas leasing on federal lands.
“Today the Biden Administration has taken yet another step to force their elitist coastal values on the rest of America. President Biden’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal lands, will impact states across the west like Utah deeply, affecting education budgets, civil services and much more.
“The University of Wyoming has projected $169M of investment losses in Utah resulting from just a one-year leasing moratorium. This same study predicts $45M of oil and gas production losses and $14M of tax revenue losses. (

)
“The Biden Administration claims to support the American worker. Apparently, that doesn’t extend to American energy producers as a leasing moratorium sends a clear signal that their jobs are not welcome here.
“Jobs will be lost. Families will be forced to relocate. Thriving communities will lose their means to continue. And to achieve what? Advocates of these polices argue that greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced. Nothing could be further from the truth. People around the world who use American fuel will still drive on roads and heat their homes. Countries like Saudi Arabia or Russia will easily make up for lost production but with greater impact to the environment.
“The Biden Administration must immediately call off its moratorium on oil and gas energy development and must be completely transparent in how they conduct all related reviews.”

Title: Sen. Lee Explains Why Senate Does Not Have Impeachment Jurisdiction Over Former Officials
Date: January 26, 2021

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after voting not to table a point of order, noting it is unconstitutional for the Senate to try a former president.
“If the Senate were to adopt a broad interpretation of the impeachment power—one allowing federal officials to be convicted on impeachment charges even after leaving office—the result would not only be problematic, but also contrary to the most natural reading of the text, structure, and historical understanding of the Constitution.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Romney Introduce the Protect Utah’s Rural Economy (PURE) Act
Date: January 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Protect Utah’s Rural Economy (PURE) Act Friday, a bill that would protect Utah from presidential Antiquities Act abuse in much the same way Alaska and Wyoming are currently protected.
“Rural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified decent-paying job, a family to love and support, and a healthy community whose future is determined by local residents – not their self-styled betters thousands of miles away,”
Sen. Lee said.
“That is why I am introducing the Protecting Utah’s Rural Economy Act today, a bill that would protect Utah from future abuses under the Antiquities Act by prohibiting the president from establishing or expanding a national monument in Utah unless the proposed monument has been authorized by an act of Congress and the state legislature.”
“Roughly two-thirds of Utah is owned by the federal government, putting our state at a disadvantage when it comes to decisions on management of our public lands,”
Senator Romney said
. “National monuments in particular have become a political football that gets tossed back and forth as presidential administrations change. Given the recent executive order to review Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, it’s even more important that we work together to end the political back and forth. The legislative process is the best way to achieve this, and I will continue seeking opportunities to work with our federal, state and local elected leaders to come to a permanent solution.”
Passed in 1906, the Antiquities Act was originally intended to protect objects of historic and cultural interest like artifacts and religious sites. Unfortunately, what was once a narrowly targeted tool for preventing looting on federal lands has become a weapon urban elites use against hard working rural Americans.
Two states, Alaska and Wyoming, both received protections from future Antiquities Act designations after millions of acres were restricted in those states. The PURE Act would give Utah’s rural communities a real voice in local land management policies, a voice they currently do not have today.

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley Reintroduce Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: January 25, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) reintroduced an amendment to the United States Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year. This amendment would put a stop to the current “status quo” of Congress spending far more money than the federal government takes in and would place strict limitations on the federal government’s ability to increase taxes, raise the debt limit, and carry out other actions that threaten our long-term fiscal sustainability.
“For far too long, hardworking Americans have been forced to bear the burden of Congress’ inability and unwillingness to control federal overspending,” Lee said. “As our federal debt continues to rise at an alarming rate, the least we can do is require the federal government to not spend more money than it has at its disposal. We expect families, businesses, and state and local governments all to stick to their budgets and live within their means – there is no reason that the federal government should not have to follow the same set of rules.”
“It’s simple math: The federal government should not be spending more taxpayer money than it brings in, outside of war or a national crisis. Families, farmers and businesses across my home state of Iowa and across the entire country make difficult decisions every day to balance the books. It’s the responsible thing to do. Almost every state has adopted some form of a balanced budget requirement, and it is past time that the federal government follows suit,” Grassley said.
The proposed amendment would require Congress to spend no more than it collects during any fiscal year, and limits spending to 18% of the gross national product, the 40-year historical average of total federal receipts. Congress can only run a deficit, raise taxes, or increase the debt limit if agreed to by two-thirds of both the House and Senate. Furthermore, the amendment gives standing to any member of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the balanced budget requirement as long as they have been authorized to do so by a petition signed by one-third of either the House or the Senate.

Title: Utah Elected Leaders Speak Out Against Harmful Biden Order on Federal Lands
Date: January 22, 2021

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT), Reps. John Curtis, Blake Moore, Chris Stewart and Burgess Owens, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Brad Wilson and Attorney General Sean Reyes issued the following joint statement in response to the Biden administration’s action to suspend oil and gas leases on public lands:
“The Biden administration’s arbitrary decision to suspend oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands is a serious mistake that will harm the same small Utah businesses that are already hurting from the pandemic. This action perpetuates the very discord between rural and urban Americans that the President spoke out against in his inauguration speech. Although it is routine for an incoming administration to pause high-level agency decisions while agency leaders get into place, such a widespread suspension of routine permitting decisions normally made in the field is unprecedented.
“The economic impacts of this decision will be felt nation-wide and couldn’t come at a worse time for Utah’s rural communities, tribes, and small businesses. Our energy industry is among the hardest hit by the pandemic. Utahns previously employed in the energy sector have lost their jobs in historic numbers. This decision only exacerbates the problem.
“We encourage President Biden to reconsider this counterproductive step. We are eager to work with his administration to improve management of our public lands, but gratuitously punishing our rural economy is not helpful.”

Title: Utah Delegation, State Officials Oppose Executive Order on Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments
Date: January 21, 2021

WASHINGTON
—The Utah congressional delegation comprised of U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT), Representatives Chris Stewart (R-UT), John Curtis (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Blake Moore (R-UT), as well as state officials including Governor Spencer Cox, Attorney General Sean Reyes, Senate President Stuart Adams, and Speaker of the House Brad Wilson, issued the following statement regarding President Biden’s executive order directing the Department of the Interior to review the boundaries and conditions of the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments.
“For over 25 years Utah has been the center of controversial and divisive unilateral national monument decisions. Roughly two-thirds of our backyard belongs to the federal government, which has meant land management actions have often been done to us rather than with us. A review in name only with predetermined results, which ultimately leads to a unilateral executive order enlarging the monuments’ boundaries, will not solve the root of the problem and will only deepen divisions in this country. We share a sincere desire to find a collaborative, broadly supported solution to the political football of national monuments in Utah, specifically Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments. It is imperative that President Biden bring the State of Utah to the table and work with state and local elected leaders toward a consensus product, including a permanent solution approved by Congress. President Biden championed a message of unity during his campaign, and we stand ready to work across party lines towards a permanent solution.”

“The United States lost a net 140,000 jobs in December, and it was a challenging month for many Americans as COVID-19 cases mounted and friends and family were separated during the holidays. At the same time, the final month of 2020 also provided a beacon of hope as the first COVID-19 vaccinations were administered across the country. As vaccinations help restore American confidence and allow them to return safely to work, it is my hope that the darkest days of the pandemic are behind us and the new year includes safely reuniting with friends, neighbors, family and coworkers.”

Title: Sen. Lee Speaks on Counting Electoral Votes
Date: January 6, 2021

Content:
Mr. President, at the time I prepared my remarks for today—it seems like a lifetime ago; a lot has changed in last few hours. So I’m going to deliver the same remarks, but it has a little bit of a different feel than it would have just a few hours ago.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the family members of those who have been injured or killed today. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to the Capitol Hill Police who valiantly defended our building and our lives.
While it is true that legitimate concerns have been raised with regard to how some of the key battleground states conducted their Presidential elections, this is not the end of the story.
We each have to remember that we have sworn an oath to uphold, protect, and defend this document, written nearly two-and-a-half centuries ago by wise men raised up by God to that very purpose. That document makes clear what our role is and what it isn’t. It makes clear who does what when it comes to deciding presidential elections. You see, because in our system of government, presidents are not directly elected. They are chosen by presidential electors.
The Constitution makes very clear under Article II, Section I that the states shall appoint presidential electors according to procedures that their legislatures develop.
Then comes the Twelfth Amendment. It explains what we’re doing here today, here in the Capitol. It explains that the President of the Senate, the Vice President of the United States, shall open the ballots and the votes shall then be counted. It is those words that confine, define, and constrain every scrap of authority that we have in this process.
Our job is to open and then count. Open, then count. That’s it. That’s all there is.
Now there are of course rare instances, instances in which multiple slates of electors can be submitted by the same state. That doesn’t happen very often. It happened in 1960. It happened in 1876. Let’s hope it doesn’t ever happen again.
In those rare moments, Congress has to make a choice. It has to decide which of the electoral votes will be counted and which will not. That did not happen here, thank heavens, and let’s hope that it never does.
Many of my colleagues have raised objections or had previously stated their intent to raise objections with regard to these. I have spent an enormous time on this issue over the last few weeks. I’ve met with lawyers on both sides of the issue. I’ve met with lawyers representing the Trump Campaign, reading everything I could find about the constitutional provisions in question, and I’ve spent a lot of time on the phone with legislators and other leaders from the contested states.
I didn’t initially declare my position because I didn’t yet have one. I wanted to get the facts first and I wanted to understand what was happening. I wanted to give the people serving in government in the contested states the opportunity to do whatever they felt they needed to do to make sure that their election was properly reflected.
I spent an enormous amount of time reaching out to state government officials in those states, but in none of the contested states—no, not even one—did I discover any indication that there was any chance that any state legislature, or secretary of state, or governor, or lieutenant governor, that had any intention to alter the slate of electors.
That being the case, our job is a very simple one. This simply isn’t how our federal system is supposed to work. That is to say, if you have concerns with the way that an election in the presidential race was handled in your state, the appropriate response is to approach your state legislatures, first and foremost. These protests, hearing from those who have raised concerns, should have been focused on their state capitols, not their nation’s Capitol.
Because our role is narrow. Our role is defined. Our role is limited.
Yes, we are the election judges, when it comes to members elected to our own body. And yes, the House of Representatives are the judges of their own races. We also have the authority to prescribe, as a Congress, rules governing the time, place, and manner of elections for senators and representatives.
There is no corresponding authority with respect to presidential elections. None, whatsoever. It doesn’t exist.
Our job is to convene, to open the ballots, and to count them. That’s it.
Thank you, Mr. President. You have the floor.

Title: Sen. Lee Commends President Trump’s Federal Architecture Executive Order
Date: December 22, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday, commending President Trump for issuing an executive order on Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture:
“As Winston Churchill said, ‘We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.’ And the shape of federal buildings over the last two generations has been abysmal: cold, boring, and contemptuous of America’s public taste and republican traditions. For decades, architectural elites and government bureaucrats have imposed their edifice complex on the American people, marring beautiful communities with ugly federal buildings.
“Federal buildings belong to the American people. And the American people – of every age, race, and ethnicity – prefer classical, humanist architecture in their government buildings. They don’t like the clunky, incoherent eyesores that the current elitist policy has too often yielded. So, it is time for a new policy, what might be called ‘civilian control of federal architecture.’
“Today’s Executive Order establishes a formal preference for the public’s favorite styles in new federal buildings, an oversight board to ensure it is followed, and – most important – requires the government to seek design input from the local communities who will actually see and use these buildings. Contrary to some criticism, the EO also provides for exactly the kind of robust regional and stylistic flexibility that has defined America’s diverse architectural heritage.”
“President Trump deserves credit for taking on elite special interests and fighting for the American people, once again.”

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Government Spending Bill
Date: December 22, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after the Senate approved a $2.3 trillion spending bill.
“For almost a year, Utahns have been fighting through terrible conditions to work, to find work, to serve their neighbors and communities as best they can. Congress has failed to meet their standard of courage and duty. This COVID relief bill - like the one Senate Democrats blocked for months out of pure partisan politics - contains some much-needed items to help Utahns recover including more funding for faster vaccine deployment and an expanded charitable deduction.”
“Unfortunately, the COVID relief bill has been packaged together with a much larger government spending bill that is bursting at the seams with special interest handouts slipped into to 5,593 pages of legislative text in the dark of night. No one who voted for this bill read it. This process has not overcome Washington dysfunction; it is Washington dysfunction. Even during a pandemic this is not how governing should be done.

Title: Sen. Lee Notes Electoral College Certification
Date: December 14, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Monday after presidential electors met and cast votes in their respective states.
“Our election process took a major step today when presidential electors met in their respective states and cast 306 electoral votes for former Vice President Joe Biden—more than the 270 electoral votes he needs to become president-elect. Concerns regarding fraud and irregularities in this election remain active in multiple states, and those concerns need to be addressed by Congress and state and local officials throughout the country. But absent new information that could give rise to a judicial or legislative determination altering the impact of today’s electoral-college votes, Joe Biden will become president of the United States on January 20, 2021.”

Title: Sen. Lee Signs Letter Opposing New Burdens on Small Business
Date: December 10, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined a letter sent to the Senate majority and minority leaders Thursday, objecting to new regulations on small businesses placed into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.
“This provision is outside the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, has not been considered by the appropriate Senate Committees or the full Senate, creates a substantial regulatory burden on millions of small businesses, exposes business owners to significant financial penalties and jail terms, and it threatens their privacy and due process rights,” the letter reads.
“These burdens and penalties would be imposed on America’s small business community in an effort to fight money laundering and other financial crimes. We doubt actual criminals will voluntarily provide incriminating information to FinCEN or that the agency could effectively manage a database the Congressional Budget Office estimates would receive 25 to 30 million initial reports. On the other hand, millions of law-abiding business owners will be subject to new reporting requirements and penalties if they fail to keep their information current and accurate.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after the Federal Trade Commission announced it is suing Facebook for illegally maintaining a social networking monopoly.
“I am glad to see that our antitrust enforcers are finally taking the threats posed by Big Tech seriously,” Sen. Lee said. “If Facebook faced greater competition, it might be more reticent to engage in the draconian censorship it has become fond of. At the same time, the FTC previously cleared both the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, and I hesitate to congratulate it now for trying to clean up its own mess. This is one more reason that antitrust enforcement should be consolidated at the Department of Justice, as I’ve proposed in the One Agency Act. I’ll be following this case closely, and look forward to continuing to exercise oversight in this area.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after voting against a resolution to disapprove of an arms sale to the United Arab Emirates:
“The signing of the Abraham Accords creates a rare and historic opportunity for diplomacy in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates – by committing to and taking action to normalize relations with Israel - demonstrates an appetite in the region that seeks stability and peace, and presents a counterbalancing front against the Iranian regime. I believe the arms sale to the UAE under consideration will contribute to this movement in the region, and will allow the United States to continue reducing our military presence throughout the Middle East. Because of these shared strategic goals, I’ve decided to support the proposed arms sale and oppose the resolutions of disapproval considered by Congress today.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces PROMISE Act to Hold Big Tech Accountable
Date: December 8, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Promoting Responsibility Over Moderation In the Social Media Environment (PROMISE) Act Tuesday, a bill designed to hold Big Tech companies accountable for their promises to not operate their social medial platforms with political bias. The legislation is cosponsored by Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS).
“The billionaires who own our nation’s Big Tech companies have every right to be partisan political actors,” Sen. Lee said. “What they don’t have a right to do is make promises to consumers that they will provide unbiased platforms and then discriminate against conservatives on those same platforms.”
“Tech companies hold significant power over the shape of American discourse and should moderate content shared on their platforms in an open and honest fashion,” said Sen. Moran. “This bill would make certain that interactive internet services are abiding by publicly-available information policies that users can easily access and understand so that users can make informed choices. In addition, this legislation would hold tech companies accountable if they misrepresent their content moderation policies while promoting a competitive marketplace that allows smaller internet companies to continue to thrive.”
Specifically, the PROMISE Act would:
Require a “covered entity” to implement, operate, and disclose information moderation policies that explain the standards, processes, and policies regarding its moderation of information provided by a user or other information content provider. Such policy must include:
Categories of information not permitted on its service or subject to moderation by users or the entity itself
The process utilized in moderating content
The notification process (if any) utilized to inform users of a moderation action taken, the rationale for the moderation decision, and options for redress (if any)
Require a “covered entity” to not make a “deceptive policy statement” with respect to its information moderation policy. A “deceptive policy statement” carries with it a rebuttable presumption that a statement is material and likely to cause injury.
Make violations of the requirements to implement, operate, or disclose an “information moderation policy” or to not make a “deceptive policy statement” constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)).

Title: Senate Passes Bill Fighting Immigration Discrimination and Protecting American Workers
Date: December 4, 2020

Content:
Few ideas are more central to who we are as Americans than the notion that people should be judged based on their own merits as an individual with God-given rights, not on the basis of the color of their skin or where they come from.
As our Founders wrote, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal…” Those words are as much a part of our national creed in this moment as they were when they were written two hundred and forty three years ago, and our laws should reflect their enduring truth.
That is why I have been working to end nationality discrimination in our nation’s employment-based green-card system ever since I arrived in Congress. This Wednesday we took a big step towards ending that discrimination by passing HR 1044, a bill designed to fight discrimination in our nation’s immigration system while also increasing protections for American workers.
Specifically the legislation would:
End country of origin discrimination by eliminating annual country-of-origin caps on green-card visas without increasing the total number of green cards issued each year.
Forbid all employers with workforces consisting of more than 50% temporary visa workers from sponsoring any new temporary visa workers.
Close the B-1 temporary business visitor visa loophole used by many employers to avoid H-1B visa caps.
Levy new fees on all H1-B applications that would be dedicated to investigating fraud in the H-1B system.
Prohibit the adjustment of status for any member of the Chinese Communist Party or People’s Liberation Army.
The House still has to pass this amended version of their original bill, and President Trump still has to sign it. But if this legislation does become law it will be the strongest anti-abuse and anti-discrimination reform passed since the H-1B program was created 30 years ago.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Screening Partnership Reform Act
Date: December 1, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Screening Partnership Reform Act, a bill that would make changes to the Transportation Safety Administration’s Screening Partnership Program.
“Our travel industry needs all the help it can get,” Sen. Lee said. “The Screening Partnership Program is a proven secure way for travelers to save money but it has been underutilized by our nation’s airports. This bill would clear some of the bureaucratic red-tape surrounding this program in an attempt to unleash the potential cost-saving benefits of these private screening contractors.”
Bill Specifics
SPRA would codify reforms to TSA’s cost estimation process by statutorily requiring TSA to account for total costs to the federal government.
SPRA would reform the SPP airport application process by providing certainty for airport operators regarding TSA’s decision-making process. In addition, SPRA gives airport operators a role in the selection of a private screening company for their airport.
SPRA would allow a private screening company to conduct on-site training and certification of private screeners led by either a TSA supervisor or a supervisor from the private screening company who holds certification from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center identical to the credential held by TSA supervisors.
SPRA would allow a private screening company participating in the SPP to annually submit recommendations to TSA on new approaches to screening processes and procedures in order to enhance the screening of passengers and property at the airport.
SPRA would clarify ambiguities in hiring practices and the terms of agreement between TSA and the SPP airport during the transition to private screening.

Title: Sen. Lee Signs Letter Requesting State Led Sage-Grouse Conservation
Date: November 20, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) signed a bicameral letter led by Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID) and Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) to House and Senate leadership urging the continued Endangered Species Act (ESA) listing prohibition for greater sage-grouse.
Without an ESA listing prohibition, greater sage-grouse remain subject to a cycle of activist litigation that costs taxpayers and undermines states’ conservation efforts. In an effort to combat this, a listing prohibition has been included in every annual appropriations bill since 2014 to allow state conservation efforts to proceed.
“[T]his prohibition gives the state conservation plans time to be effectively implemented and show results,” the letter read in part. “Instead of allowing the greater sage-grouse to be another victim of the activism industry that has been built around ESA-related litigation, we want to conserve the species. Using the knowledge and personal buy-in from States and local communities that have invested years in the development and implementation of these plans is the best way to do so.”
Additional signers of the letter included Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), John Barrasso (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MO), Mike Enzi (R-WY), John Hoeven (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Representatives Russ Fulcher (R-ID), Rob Bishop (R-UT), Bruce Westerman (R-AR), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Chris Stewart (R-UT), Mike Conaway (R-TX), Tom Tiffany (R-WI), Liz Cheney (R-WY), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Greg Gianforte (R-MO), Jim Baird (R-IN), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Cook (R-CA), Ken Buck (R-CO), Mark Amodei (R-NV), and John Curtis (R-UT).
Background: The State of Utah has a long history of successful wildlife management and conservation. In the case of the sage-grouse, significant contributions to the science, management and conservation of the species have been achieved under state management authority. Utah currently supports an estimated 6.8% of the total range-wide population of sage-grouse. The statewide population of sage-grouse in Utah has shown a stable-to increasing population trend over the past 20 years.
Full text of the letter is available
here
and below:
Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer and Leader McCarthy:
We write to ask for your support for continuing the Endangered Species Act (ESA) listing prohibition for the greater sage-grouse, a provision that has been enacted in annual spending bills since fiscal year 2015 and is included in the Senate’s Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies spending bill for fiscal year 2021. State-led conservation of the species is working, and the Fish and Wildlife Service has signaled no intent or need to list the species in 2021. Continuing the provision for another year therefore does no harm to the species while saving taxpayers from expensive litigation and freeing up limited appropriations for truly endangered species.
Species conservation is of the utmost importance in the West, and the commitment shown to conserving greater sage-grouse is certainly no exception. The 11 western states with sage-grouse habitat have individually implemented collaborative, science-based conservation plans tailored to address the specific issues of their individual landscapes. These conservation strategies were created with extensive input from diverse stakeholders including scientists, conservationists, previous Administrations, and local industry leaders.
However, despite this scientific and collaborative approach, the greater sage-grouse has been embroiled in a cycle of litigation and listing determinations for decades. The threat of litigation undermines the collaborative process started by the Obama Administration in 2011. With as many as three listing considerations within a ten-year period, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has consistently found State-led strategies to be successful in avoiding the need to list the species. Despite this, conservation efforts have also faced top-down Federal directives that completely disregard local land management expertise and communities. Meanwhile, time and resources that could have been spent working on conservation have been wasted in lawsuits and bureaucracy. Some have argued that a potential listing keeps the pressure on conservation efforts, yet every year that the provision has been incorporated in the bill, funding for sage-grouse conservation has increased because of the commitment and partnerships of Federal, State, and local leaders.
Species conservation is a slow process, and this prohibition gives the state conservation plans time to be effectively implemented and show results. It also provides for on-the-ground decision-making and multiple land uses that communities have come to rely on. Instead of allowing the greater sage-grouse to be another victim of the activism industry that has been built around ESA-related litigation, we want to conserve the species. Using the knowledge and personal buy-in from States and local communities that have invested years in the development and implementation of these plans is the best way to do so.
The continuation of the prohibition against ESA listing for the greater sage-grouse is crucial not only for preserving ongoing State-Federal collaboration, but also for the long-term survival of the species. We appreciate your consideration of this request.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces One Agency Act to Streamline Antitrust Enforcement
Date: November 19, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the One Agency Act Wednesday, legislation that would improve antitrust enforcement by putting all antitrust enforcement under one roof, at the Department of Justice.
“When no one knows who is in charge, bad things happen, and sophisticated players like Facebook, Twitter, and Google—who can afford an army of lawyers, lobbyists, and consultants—can game the system to their own advantage, and thereby avoid accountability for engaging in anticompetitive behavior,” Sen. Lee said. “It’s clear that our current dual agency antitrust enforcement arrangement isn’t working. The Justice Department is more politically accountable, and its structure is better suited to decisive enforcement.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Protect Americans from Attack Drones
Date: November 13, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Enhanced Protection from Unmanned Aircraft Attacks Act Thursday, legislation designed to better protect Americans from malicious drone usage.
“Drones already benefit this nation in so many ways, and I know Americans will keep coming up with new ways for them to help us,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately, there are also those who use this technology for malicious purposes, and law enforcement needs the manpower to counter this threat.”
Currently, Congress has granted exclusive and limited authority to detect and take down drones to only the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Energy.
According to a Blue Ribbon Task Force Report commissioned by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), one challenge in meeting current drone threats is the federal government’s lack of human resources or capital to invest in and operate counter-drone technology at airports. When you consider this issue beyond the airport environment, the challenge becomes even greater.
The Enhanced Protection from Unmanned Aircraft Attacks Act would extend the existing counter-drone authority of the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Energy to allow them to contract with private companies for this work. It would require an update of the Federal Acquisition Regulations within 180 days to reflect the updated counter-drone contract authority.

Title: Senators Ask Google CEO to Explain Apparent Election-Related Disparities
Date: November 5, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) today sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai after a nonpartisan study raised questions about whether Google targeted get-out-the-vote messages specifically to liberal users in the run-up to the election. In testimony before the Senate last month, Mr. Pichai said that Google does not alter any product to promote a specific political viewpoint.
A study of 773 politically diverse computer users in the lead-up to the election by Dr. Robert Epstein found that only liberal users received get-out-the-vote notifications from Monday, Oct. 26 through Thursday, Oct. 29.
“Dr. Epstein’s allegations appear credible and are very concerning. If it is true that Google is targeting messages to help Democrats win elections, then Google has not been truthful to Congress and has deceived countless Americans. These allegations must be taken seriously. Congress must have all the facts and evidence from Dr. Epstein with responses from Google as we consider changes to address these serious issues,”
said Sen. Lee.
“Dr. Epstein’s response to my phone call regarding his monitoring of Google’s election activities contains a number of astonishing revelations. First is the fact that in order to maintain their viewership numbers on Google’s search platform, newspapers and other media outlets share their Gmail communications with Google. Second is that in order to tilt voter participation in favor of Democrat candidates, Google was sending a voting reminder only to individuals it profiled as liberal. And third is that, according to Dr. Epstein, by monitoring the New York Post’s Gmail account, Google became aware that Dr. Epstein had documented their biased vote reminder. Only then did they end the liberal only vote reminder and begin sending the vote reminder to all voters. Google and other social media giants have amassed far too much power, and this example of Orwellian Big Brother manipulation demonstrates that Congress must address this significant threat to our democracy and freedoms,”
said Sen. Johnson.
“Big Tech presents a grave threat to free speech in America and to the integrity of our elections,”
said Sen. Cruz.
“Google has more power than any company on the face of the planet, and Dr. Epstein’s findings raise serious concerns about Google’s abuse of that power and its willingness to manipulate its platform to help Joe Biden win the presidency. Google must provide answers as to why and how it manipulated users to influence this election.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Protections for Good Faith PPP Borrowers and Lenders Act

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protections for Good Faith PPP Borrowers and Lenders Act Monday, legislation designed to protect good faith borrowers and lenders from penalties associated with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
“Lending institutions served an important role in delivering support to employers and employees during a very uncertain and difficult time for our country,” Sen. Lee said. “These good faith actors should not be penalized for changes made to PPP after they had already acted.”
Specifically, the legislation would:
Gives good faith lenders who participated in the PPP protection from penalties and from enforcement actions under the Small Business Act; the False Claims Act; the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act; and other criminal and civil laws
Protect borrowers who do not engage in fraud or misuse of funds from penalties
Remove PPP loans from calculation of assets or balance sheets for regulations based on the size of a lending institution
Remove PPP loans from the regulatory purview of the CFPB

Title: Sens. Lee Tillis Grassley Introduce SMARTER Antirust Reform
Date: October 27, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, Monday, a bill that would require the Federal Trade Commission to go through the same procedures that the Department of Justice must go through when enforcing antitrust law, and would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue merger review decisions expeditiously.
“As I’ve said before, the only people that benefit from uncertainty in antitrust law are antitrust lawyers,” Sen. Lee said. “Both businesses and consumers deserve clarity and certainty when it comes to federal antitrust law enforcement and the SMARTER Act would create a simpler and more equal system.”
“Our antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and promote competition. We ought to be consistent when determining whether proposed mergers meet these goals, regardless of the agency conducting the review. Our legislation creates a more uniform standard for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure greater fairness and simplicity when reviewing proposed mergers and their impacts on consumers,” Grassley said.
“The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice unnecessarily apply different procedures and standards for reviewing proposed mergers,” said Senator Tillis. “This commonsense legislation will streamline the enforcement of our federal antitrust laws by creating a system of consistency that will benefit consumers and businesses.”
The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission share concurrent jurisdiction to review proposed mergers for compliance with the antitrust laws but it is not always clear in advance which agency will review a particular merger.
Although the two antitrust agencies apply the same substantive law to the mergers they review, their procedures differ in important ways.
The SMARTER Act fixes this problem by requiring the Commission to satisfy the same standards that DOJ must meet in order to obtain a preliminary injunction to block a merger and requiring the Commission to litigate the merits of contested merger cases in federal court under the Clayton Act—just as DOJ does—rather than before its own administrative tribunals.
Separately, certain mergers also require approval of the Federal Communications Commission. However, the Federal Communications Commission’s merger review procedures create an open-ended process that fuels uncertainty and is potentially insulated from judicial review. This invites regulatory mischief from both sides of the aisle that only leads to an imbalance in the implementation of regulatory policy. The current process results in an inconsistent merger review process that not only harms the businesses seeking to complete a transaction in a timely manner, but it also hurts workers and consumers alike. The SMARTER Act fixes this problem by requiring the Commission to issue a decision within 180 days of receiving a completed merger application. The merger review process should not invite Congress or a regulatory agency to put a thumb on the scale of a particular transaction, but instead it should enable a fair and timely system that affords due process.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces UNSHACKLE Act to Reform NEPA
Date: October 26, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON. -Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the “Undoing NEPA’s Substantial Harm by Advancing Concepts that Kickstart the Liberation of the Economy” or UNSHACKLE Act on Monday, legislation that would comprehensively reform the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND).
“Environmental planning is essential to sustainable growth, but unfortunately NEPA has become a weapon used by special interests to make much-needed infrastructure and maintenance projects throughout our country prohibitively expensive,” Sen. Lee said. “The UNSHACKLE Act will reform the NEPA process so that federal agencies, state, and local governments are better empowered to carry out NEPA’s original process while also making our nation’s infrastructure and maintenance project affordable again.”
“For years, NEPA’s burdensome requirements have left countless infrastructure projects in a state of judicial and bureaucratic limbo, stunting job creation and economic growth in communities across the country,” Sen. Cruz said. “Providing meaningful reform to streamline the NEPA process will help hard-working men and women return to work on delayed projects and help our economy continue to flourish.”
“The National Environmental Policy Act is a 50 year-old law designed to ensure infrastructure and energy projects consider environmental factors prior to development. Without congressional action, the bureaucracy has turned NEPA compliance into an overly complicated process where permitting often takes longer than building the project itself. Leave it to the bureaucracy to turn a law meant to help something move forward into rules that are only good for holding something up,” Sen. Cramer said. “The UNSHACKLE Act will empower state and local governments while providing legal certainty and clear limitations to the federal bureaucracy.”
The UNSHACKLE Act is comprehensive NEPA legislation that combines five other previously introduced NEPA reform acts into one bill. Those other bills are:
The NEPA Data Transparency and Accountability Act
The NEPA State Assignment Expansion Act
The NEPA Agency Process Accountability Act
The NEPA Accountability and Enforcement Act
The NEPA Legal Reform Act

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces NEPA Legal Reform Act
Date: October 21, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the NEPA Legal Reform Act Wednesday, legislation that would make it harder for special interests to delay much-needed infrastructure projects with nuisance lawsuits.
“Environmental planning is absolutely essential to sustainable growth, but unfortunately NEPA has been turned into a weapon used by special interests to delay much-needed infrastructure and maintenance projects throughout our country,” Sen. Lee said. “The NEPA Legal Reform Act is common sense policy that will reduce nuisance lawsuits, make infrastructure projects more efficient and affordable, all while preserving the necessary environmental planning process.”
Specifically, the bill would:
Judicial Standing Requirements - Require a plaintiff bringing a NEPA related claim to demonstrate the plaintiff has personally suffered (or will likely personally suffer) a “direct, tangible harm.
Statute of Limitations - Set a 150-day statute of limitations for all NEPA related claims beginning the day after the final agency action has been taken under the NEPA process
Temporary Injunctive Relief Reform - Codify the elements of a preliminary injunction issued by SCOTUS in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. 555 US __ (2008) and require proof of each element by “clear and convincing” evidence; and require an additional finding of extraordinary circumstances that warrant the preliminary injunction; and require the court to consider the preliminary injunction’s effects on public health, safety, the environment, and jobs.
Permanent Injunction Relief reform - Codify the elements of a permanent injunction issued by SCOTUS in Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 (2010) and require proof of each element by “clear and convincing” evidence; require an additional finding of extraordinary circumstances that warrant the injunction; and require an injunction to be “as narrowly tailored as possible to correct an injury” and “the least intrusive means necessary to correct the injury.”
Bonding Requirement - Require the court to fully apply Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for all preliminary injunctions granted for a NEPA related action. Rule 65(c) requires a security to be posted according to what “the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”

Title: Highlights from Sen. Lee’s Opening Statement
Date: October 12, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered opening remarks at Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing today. A full video and transcript of the speech can be found here. Below are some highlights:
“We’ve heard this morning a number of arguments. They are essentially policy arguments, many of them geared toward actual policies, in some cases actual pieces of legislation.”
“If you were watching today’s hearing, and some of the statements made by some of my colleagues, in fact if you were to look at any of the countless posters put up in here, you would think that this was a political discussion, a policy discussion, a legislative discussion. You in fact are not being reviewed for a legislative position, or policy making position.”
“One might also have the impression from watching this morning’s proceedings so far that the Supreme Court of the United States is a remarkably bitter, cynical, and overwhelmingly partisan place. It is not… Despite its flaws, and despite the fact that it sometimes makes mistakes, the Supreme Court of the United States sits atop something that is the envy of the entire world: a judicial system, that despite the fact that it is run by human beings and is therefore imperfect, is the best judicial system that has ever existed on planet earth.”
“These tactics of creating fear and uncertainty and doubt, these tactics that result in relentless protests outside of the one branch of government that isn’t political, astound me; but they dismay me and they disappoint me. They reflect the fact that we have allowed for the politicization of the one branch of the federal government that is not political.”

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Reform to Help Veteran Careers
Date: October 9, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference Thursday, encouraging them to adopt a Senate-led proposal on the 180-day rule which has only served to hurt veterans and their families without providing any protection for taxpayers.
“The 180-day waiting period required for military servicemembers retiring from active duty but who wish to continue serving their country through civilian employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) has proven to be an artificial barrier to entry for highly skilled veterans,” Sen. Lee said.
“These highly-qualified individuals are needed most, can least afford to wait, and are otherwise perfect fits for these jobs. The House and Senate both included provisions addressing this issue in the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and I along with a group of my Senate colleagues believe we have put forward a solution for the conference process that will bring reasonable, needed reform to the 180-day rule.”
The 180-day rule was originally adopted to prevent high ranking DOD personnel from carving out civilian employment opportunities for themselves. Unfortunately this rule has disproportionately hurt rank-and-file servicemembers.
Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), James Lankford (R-OK), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) also signed the letter.

Title: Lee and Toomey Issue Statement Regarding an Additional Round of Taxpayer-Funded Grants for Airlines
Date: October 8, 2020

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) issued the following statement detailing their concerns regarding another round of taxpayer-funded grants for the passenger airline companies:
“For the past six months, the American taxpayers have spent $25 billion covering the payroll obligations of passenger airlines. No other Fortune 500 companies – including restaurant groups, transportation firms, hotel chains, or entertainment businesses – have received taxpayer-funded grants. The excess capacity of the airline sector will not be resolved in the near future and continuing to force the entire payroll obligation onto the taxpayers is not sustainable.
“No one wants to see layoffs, but we have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer resources are used in an appropriate and equitable manner. Rather than collect another round of grant funding, airlines should start (or in some cases continue to) take advantage of the low-interest, long-term loans from the federal government under the CARES Act. The favorable terms of these loans will make it possible for the airlines to repay the taxpayers once air travel picks back up.
“Consideration of legislation providing grants to the airlines should not happen unless there are adequate protections for taxpayers and the opportunity to offer related amendments.”

Title: Sen. Lee Responds to Netflix Defense of “Shameful” Movie Promotion
Date: October 5, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Monday after reading Netflix’s response to an earlier letter Sen. Lee sent Netflix about the movie Cuties.
“Just over three weeks ago, I joined a chorus of concerned Americans in expressing our outrage and disgust at the film, Cuties, distributed by Netflix. I wrote to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to share these concerns and request that Netflix explain whether or not the potential exploitation of young girls depicted in the film violated federal law. I later discussed my concerns in more detail with Netflix employees by phone. I have to say that I am unsatisfied by Netflix’s response.
“Asked whether the sexualization of young girls depicted in Cuties constituted criminal conduct, Netflix offered only conclusory statements in denial. I am not convinced.
“But setting aside the legal question, there is a more pressing moral question. Netflix itself acknowledges that the conduct of the young girls in Cuties “is inappropriate, shameful, and a hallmark of a cultural failing.” I couldn’t agree more. What I cannot understand, however, is how Netflix can condemn the conduct depicted in Cuties, while celebrating the film and filmmakers who asked several underage girls to stand in front of a camera and engage in that same “inappropriate, shameful” conduct for all the world to see.
“I reiterate my call for Netflix to cease distributing Cuties. Until it does so, Netflix lacks the moral standing to speak to any cultural issue.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Poverty Measurement Improvement Act
Date: September 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Poverty Measurement Improvement Act Wednesday, a bill that would improve the accuracy of poverty measurement by requiring the Census Bureau to supplement its existing poverty data with additional data from other federal agencies.
“This bill has one goal, to protect the most vulnerable by making sure our limited government resources are being used as efficiently as possible,” Sen. Lee said. “We spend over $1 trillion on means-tested welfare programs every year, so we need to make sure that money is being spent effectively.”
The Census Bureau’s current population survey does not capture all the income and benefits that low-income Americans receive. The survey’s participants dramatically underreport both income and receipt of funds. This necessarily understates the anti-poverty effect of the federal government’s poverty alleviation spending.
The Consumer Expenditure survey, which measures spending, is administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the past twenty years, the vast majority of low-income households—70 percent—report their spending to be higher than their income. The data on receipts of means-tested benefits is readily available, but the CPS data is not cross-checked against this actual administrative data.
This bill would require the Census Bureau to supplement their existing poverty data with new data collected from other federal agencies.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces NEPA Accountability and Enforcement Act
Date: September 17, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the NEPA Accountability and Enforcement Act Thursday, a bill that would set a maximum two-year deadline for agencies to complete the NEPA process.
“The NEPA environmental review process has unfortunately become a weapon used by special interest groups to throttle much needed infrastructure investments across the country. The average time to complete an Environmental Impact Statement is over 4.5 years with more than a quarter of all reviews taking more than 6 years,” Sen Lee said. “This bill will cut through unnecessary delays and deliver better projects on time to millions of Americans that need them.”
Bill Specifics:
Shot-clock on the NEPA Process
-Federal agencies would have one year to issue an Environmental Assessment (EA), Categorical Exclusion (CE), or a notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
-If an EIS is necessary, the federal agency would have one more year to complete the EIS with an overall shot clock of two years for an agency to complete the NEPA process.
-If OMB determines that the head of a federal agency missed these deadlines, OMB would reduce the “account for salaries and expenses of the office of the head of the Federal agency” by 0.5% for each violation with additional 0.5% reductions taking place every additional 90 days thereafter until the process is completed.
Shot-clock on Project Permits
-Would require a federal agency to approve or deny any permit or authorization for a project within 90 days of completion of the project’s NEPA process. If the agency fails to act within 90 days, the permit would be deemed approved.
-Agencies would provide all denials with (1) evidence for the denial, (2) recommendations for corrections, and (3) an opportunity to correct the violation without having to undertake the NEPA process again.

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Letter Calling for Further Investigation into Chinese Goods Produced by Slave Labor
Date: September 17, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to President Trump and Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan Thursday, calling for a further investigation into goods made from slave labor in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
“There is significant, publicly available evidence suggesting that religious and ethnic minority citizens in Xinjiang are being forcibly detained, indoctrinated, and conscripted into labor against their will. Most recently, according to media reports, Uyghurs have been forcibly transported to work in factories in COVID-19 infected areas to keep supply chains running. Disturbing reports of forced acts of sacrilege, anti-religious statist indoctrination, and forced abortions and sterilizations abound from the region,” the letter reads.
“We were pleased to see this week that CBP invoked its Section 307 authority to block the importation of certain goods from Xinjiang. While we applaud all that you have done to combat Chinese aggression and abuses of natural rights, we encourage you to continue to investigate the region to determine whether any additional withhold release orders ought to be issued,” the letter continues.
Other senators signing the letter include: Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Martha McSally (R-AZ), John Thune (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), John Hoeven (R-ND), and John Cornyn (R-TX).

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Help Military Families
Date: September 17, 2020

Content:
WASHGINTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act Thursday, legislation that would give military spouses with valid professional licenses in one state, reciprocity in the state where their spouse is currently serving on military orders.
“Military families consistently rate Utah as a top destination to serve and a big reason why is the work our state has done to make sure professional military spouses licensed in one state can also work in Utah. The American people absolutely depend on the brave men and women of our nation’s Armed Services, and the families of those brave men and women deserve all the support we can give them. This bill helps do that by making it easier for military spouses to work when they have to transition to a new duty station.”
Senators cosponsoring the bill include: Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Martha McSally (R-AZ), John Boozman (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Risch (R-ID), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mitt Romney (R-UT), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Thom Tillis (R-NC).

Title: Sen. Lee Reflects on Google Antitrust Hearing
Date: September 16, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday, following Tuesday’s hearing on Google’s possible violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act:
“I was very pleased with how yesterday’s hearing went. I and the other subcommittee members all put tough questions to Google and had a mostly productive discussion, which is what we wanted to happen.
“I say mostly productive because, while the members put good questions to Google, I have to say I wasn’t satisfied with many of its answers. A lot of it felt scripted and not exactly responsive to the questions we asked. Specifically, Google’s witness was evasive about the number of competitors that really compete with Google.
“As any antitrust lawyer will tell you, it’s not the number of competitors, but their size and market share that matters. No one can compare to Google in that respect. In fact, my office has heard from publishers who do use a large number of advertising tools, but still get 99% of their ad revenue from Google. Second, Google didn’t seem to tell the whole story about its ad pricing. That pricing is not transparent; a publisher doesn’t know what an advertiser bid on a specific ad, and advertisers don’t know how much of each bid goes to the publisher. And while Google claimed its margin is competitive with other ad platforms, that doesn’t mean much if it is manipulating the auction process, to ensure that Google always wins.
“Finally, Google also didn’t seem to understand my question about what’s called 'quality-adjusted price' in antitrust parlance. That gets to the idea that advertisers may be spending less per ad, but more overall in order to achieve an actual sale.
“My takeaway from the hearing was that Google has a commanding share of every piece of the ad stack, and it appears to be using its leading market positions in search and online video to engage in tying on the advertiser side of its business, essentially forcing the vast majority of demand onto its platform. In turn, publishers are also forced to use Google’s platform because there really isn’t any other option.
“Antitrust analysis depends heavily on the facts, and we simply don’t have them all here. I am glad that the Department of Justice is seriously investigating these allegations, and hope it will pursue an appropriate remedy if necessary.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces NEPA Process Accountability Act
Date: September 16, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the NEPA Agency Process Accountability Act Wednesday, a bill designed reduce delays and paperwork while also promoting better environmental decision making.
“The NEPA process has become a bureaucratic nightmare that makes it impossible for American taxpayers to invest in timely and efficient infrastructure projects. This bill will streamline the environmental review process by reducing duplicative paperwork and unnecessary analysis, thus reducing the cost and time needed to complete needed infrastructure projects.”
Specifically the bill:
Limits on Alternatives Considered by Agencies
-Would prohibit all agencies from considering alternatives to the proposed action if the alternative considered is not “technically or economically feasible to the project sponsor” or if the alternative is not within the jurisdiction of the federal agency.
Consolidating NEPA Documents
-For projects that require the preparation of an EIS, would require an agency to only produce one EIS, one EA (if applicable), and one record of decision.
-For projects that do not require the preparation of an EIS, would require an agency to only produce one EA or FONSI.
Categorical Exclusion Sharing
-Would allow a federal agency to (without further compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act) use a categorical exclusion (CE) approved by: (1) another Federal agency and the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ); or (2) an act of Congress.
-If an agency chooses to use a Categorical Exclusion in this manner, they would have to, consistent with CEQ regulations: (1) carefully review the Categorical Exclusion to make sure it fits the action the agency wants to exclude, and (2) consider whether there are extraordinary circumstances for the proposed project that warrant the drafting of an EA or EIS instead of a CE.
Allow Agencies to Reuse Previous NEPA Analysis and Work
-Would allow federal agencies to use applicable findings and research from a prior NEPA process and incorporate those previous findings and research into an agency’s current NEPA analysis under some scenarios.
Authorizes the Adoption of Applicable State Environmental Documents
-Would authorize a federal agency to adopt a document prepared under a State law as the EIS or EA for a proposed action in order to comply with NEPA as long as the federal agency determines applicable state’s law: (1) provides the same level of environmental analysis as NEPA; and (2) allows for the opportunity of public comment.
Permits Third Parties to Prepare NEPA Documents for Agencies to Adopt
-Would create a process for the selection of a “qualified third party” chosen by a project sponsor to prepare an environmental document for the federal agency. The selection process includes requirements that: (1) the project sponsor submit a written request to the federal agency, (2) a 30-day shot clock for the agency to approve or deny the written request, and (3) requirements that the agency determine that the third party has no conflicts of interest and is qualified to prepare a NEPA document.
-Would allow a federal agency to adopt the “qualified third party” environmental document as long as: (1) the document was prepared at the project sponsor’s expense, and (2) the federal agency provides oversight of the document’s preparation and independently evaluates the environmental document for compliance with NEPA.
Multi-Agency Projects
-For projects that require approvals from multiple agencies, would create a regulatory process that agencies must follow to select a lead agency, select cooperating agencies, and coordinate the preparation of the one EIS or EA.
NEPA Data Reporting Requirements
-Would require federal agencies to annually report to Congress: (1) the number of CEs, EAs, and EISs issued in the last fiscal year, (2) the time it took to approve such proposed actions, and (3) the number of proposed actions that are under NEPA review as of the date report is issued.
-Would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the CEQ to jointly develop a methodology to assess the comprehensive costs of the NEPA process. Would require federal agencies to adopt OMB/CEQ’s methodology and report (1) the comprehensive cost of the NEPA process for each proposed action completed within the reporting period, and (2) for pending NEPA actions, the amount of money currently expended for the project and the estimated future costs to the complete the analysis.
Eliminates EPA Review of all EISs
-Would repeal Section 309 of the Clean Air Act, which requires mandatory EPA comment on all EIS’s from all federal agencies, instead allowing EPA to voluntarily comment on an EIS if they choose to do so.
Flexibility for Unexpected Circumstances
-Would allow a federal agency or a project sponsor to consider options to mitigate the new or unexpected circumstances or conditions in order to avoid significant effects without having to presumptively redo the entire NEPA process.

Title: Sen. Lee’s Spectrum Valuation Act Passes Committee
Date: September 16, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Senate Commerce Committee passed Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) Spectrum Valuation Act Wednesday, legislation that would require the federal government to estimate the value of electromagnetic spectrum currently assigned to federal agencies.
“Congress has a clear responsibility to ensure that federal spectrum is being managed effectively and appropriately,” Sen. Lee said. “By simply calculating the value of federal spectrum allocations, Congress and the Administration would be better equipped to identify highly valuable federal spectrum bands, and thus manage each federal spectrum allocation more efficiently. That means we can better manage how government agencies use their spectrum to fulfill their mission requirements as well as identify the potential inefficiencies.”

WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Friday, asking the CEO to explain why his company’s film “Cuties” doesn’t constitute a criminal exploitation of minors.
“While I have concerns with the movie’s young actresses’ influence on other young girls, my larger concern is with the possibility that the inappropriate scenes might encourage the sexual exploitation of young girls by adults,” the letter reads. “The federal government currently spends hundreds of millions of dollars combating child trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and child pornography both domestically and abroad,” the letter continues.
“My staff is reviewing the film and the pertinent law to determine whether to refer the presentation of this film to the United States Attorney General for investigation. It would be most helpful if you could provide my office with an explanation on your views as to whether or not the potential exploitation of minors in this film constitutes criminal behavior by Friday, September 18, 2020,” the letter concludes.

Title: Senator Lee Introduces Pro-Business Fixes to Struggling Fed Program
Date: August 11, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has introduced an amendment to improve the Main Street Lending Program (MSLP) to better address the financial needs of businesses and banks as part of COVID-19 relief measures.
Congress previously authorized the MSLP during the second relief measure, granting authority to the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to help banks lend to businesses in need of liquidity during the downturn by guaranteeing approximately $600 billion in loans. But unfortunately, due to certain requirements of the program, the MSLP has failed to provide businesses the liquidity they need and discouraged banks from participating as lenders.
Under MSLP’s current requirements, the minimum loan size is $250,000, an amount that is far too large to be useful to most small businesses. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has set the interest rate for the program’s loans to be LIBOR plus 3% – a rate that is unattractive to most businesses as lower interest rates are available outside the program, and which does not allow lenders to compete to lower interest rates. Finally, the lenders must pay the Fed a 1% servicing fee that is at least as large as the servicing fee lenders are allowed to charge borrowers, making it less attractive to banks and more difficult for them to compete for borrowers by lowering their own service fees.
As a result, of the more than 10,500 lending institutions that exist in the U.S., only about 300 are currently participating in the program. So far, MSLP purchased less than one-tenth of one percent of its total loan capacity, despite the widespread need for liquidity among businesses across the nation.
“Instead of refilling the Paycheck Protection Program or creating other costly programs that are not targeted to need, we should make a program that we have already paid for work. That is why I have drafted the Main Street Lending Program Proliferation and Promulgation Act, or MSLPPP. This amendment would make simple tweaks to ensure the MSLP works for businesses by providing banks the option to offer more generous terms,” said. Sen. Lee.
The Main Street Lending Program Proliferation and Promulgation Act would:
Remove the minimum loan size to allow businesses to borrow an amount that meet their needs.
Remove the minimum interest rate while allowing the Fed to set a cap
Remove the Fed’s 1% servicing fee

Title: Lee, Johnson Ask Google for Answers About Political Bias on Platform

WASHINGTON — U.S. Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), members of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai Thursday asking for answers regarding alleged political bias within the company’s search function.
“At the [House Committee on the Judiciary] hearing, many Members of Congress questioned you regarding alleged political bias within the search function of your platform. You reiterated several times in your verbal testimony that ‘any work we (Google) do around elections is non-partisan,’ and any form of political bias occurring on the platform ‘goes against Google’s core values.’ Unfortunately, for you and the democratic discourse in this country, there are numerous examples to support that the contrary is occurring,” the senators wrote.
“The integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance. Voters depend on platforms like Google to research and gather information about elections—who the candidates are, what those candidates support, voter registration deadlines, election dates, polling locations, etc. If it is true that Google is using its market power and search algorithms to surreptitiously influence election results, that would be a serious violation of the public trust.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Murphy Introduce Bill to Prohibit Export of UAS
Date: August 6, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Rand Paul (R-KY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Chris Coons (D-DE) today introduced legislation that would amend the Arms Export Control Act to prohibit the export of certain weaponized unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).
Since 1987, there have been restrictions placed on the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles, rockets, and unmanned air vehicles by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The MTCR is an informal, voluntary agreement among 35 countries to use export controls to slow the ability of adversarial nations to acquire equipment for weapons of mass destruction. The agreement – of which the U.S. is a participant and founding member – has proven successful in making it more difficult for nefarious state actors like Iran and North Korea to acquire weapons delivery systems.
On July 24
th
, the Trump administration announced a unilateral change to the United States’ export policy for UAS, downgrading the classification of a certain subset of UAS systems in order to facilitate their export. While there are some NATO and Indo-Pacific allies who are interested in buying these systems, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have expressed repeated interest in these parts, which would only better enable them to continue the war in Yemen.
The bill would address this problem by prohibiting the export, transfer, or trade of covered unmanned aircraft systems while allowing exceptions for NATO members, Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea.
“It is long past time we end U.S. participation in this unauthorized and unjustified war in Yemen,”
said Lee.
“I am concerned that making it easier for the United States to export weapon-capable UAS systems to Saudi Arabia and the UAE further entrenches the U.S. role in the war in Yemen and perpetuates an incentive structure for keeping rather than drawing down U.S. presence in the Middle East, which is why I am joining Senator Murphy in co-sponsoring this legislation.”
“Selling weaponized drones into the Middle East could come with disastrous consequences. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) has worked for decades to stop the sale of deadly missiles and drones to countries like Iran and North Korea, and the president is willing to blow it up in order to continue the blank check approach he has taken with Saudi Arabia and the UAE,”
said Murphy.
“If we allow Trump to start selling drones, we set a dangerous precedent that allows and encourages other countries to sell missile technology and advanced drones to our adversaries. In addition, the president’s action will only further enable the Saudis to continue killing more innocent civilians in Yemen by supplying them with advanced US-made drones. Congress can stop Trump in his tracks by making some of the limits of the MTCR legally binding. Doing so will protect innocent civilians, stop an arms race from spiraling out of control, and strengthen U.S. national security and our interests abroad.”

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Letter Asking Justice Department to Immediately Investigate Meat Processing Plant Merger
Date: July 30, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), five other senators, and six members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Justice Department Antitrust Division Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim Wednesday, asking him to immediately open an investigation into the acquisition of a Mountain States Rosen (MSR) lamb processing facility in Greeley, CO.
“MSR is a cooperative owned by more than 145 American families. Reports tell us that its Greeley facility is the second largest lamb packaging plant in the United States, processing approximately 350,000 lambs annually, over 6,000 per week, with an annual capacity of nearly 800,000. MSR accounts for about one-fifth of the entire U.S. lamb market,” the letter reads.
“We understand that [the current buyer] is not the first potential buyer to express interest in the MSR facility. An earlier interested buyer intended to continue operating MSR’s Greeley facility and even expand its capacity. However, it appears that after submitting a winning bid during bankruptcy proceedings, JBS is preparing to completely shut down all lamb processing at the site. It is our understanding that JBS intends to permanently destroy all of the lamb processing equipment as soon as this week,” the letter continues.
“We urge you to immediately open an investigation into this acquisition and demand that JBS cease from any irreversible actions that might harm the ability of American sheep ranchers to get their products to market until the Department can determine how best to protect competition in this significant part of America’s food supply,” the letter concludes.
Senators joining Sen. Lee on the letter include: Sens. Steve Daines (R-MT), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mitt Romney (R-UT), John Thune (R-SD), Michael Rounds (R-SD).
Representatives signing the letter include: Reps. Chris Stewart (R-UT), Greg Gianforte (R-MT), Rob Bishop (R-UT), Devin Nunes (R-CA), Dusty Johnson (R-SD), and Liz Cheney (R-WY).

Title: Sen. Lee Asks Big Tech to Justify Content Moderation Policies
Date: July 30, 2020

WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to the CEOs of Alphabet, Facebook, Squarespace, and Twitter Thursday asking each company to identify and justify their content moderation process.
“I am specifically concerned about corporations using their power unilaterally to silence opinions they dislike and thus warp the public debates their platforms present to the American people,” the letter reads.
Sen Lee goes on to ask the Big Tech CEOs 11 questions including:

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Letter to Trump Regarding Medicaid ‘MOE’ Concerns in FFCRA
Date: July 30, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), along with Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Mike Braun (R-IN) today sent a letter to President Trump expressing their concerns regarding the Medicaid “maintenance of effort” (MOE) provision that was included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).
You can read a full copy of
the letter
here and below:
“We write to highlight our concern with the Medicaid ‘maintenance of effort’ (MOE) provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). This provision gravely threatens the integrity of state budgets and threatens the very purpose of the Medicaid program: to serve the truly needy.
“The Medicaid ‘MOE’ provision, perhaps better described as state budget handcuffs, requires states to maintain all persons enrolled in state Medicaid programs—regardless of whether they qualify for the program. The text says that states may not receive increased federal financial assistance unless everyone on the program, even someone who is or becomes ineligible, is:
‘treated as eligible for such benefits through the end of the month in which such emergency period ends unless the individual requests a voluntary termination of eligibility or the individual ceases to be a resident of the State.’
“The ‘emergency period’ is expected to last well into next year according to the Congressional Budget Office, and could be much longer. Because of this provision, states may be required to keep ineligible individuals on the Medicaid program, even after they return to work, or even if they gained access to the program fraudulently.
“We are concerned that this provision will threaten the integrity of state budgets. In FFCRA, Congress also authorized an additional temporary 6.2 percent federal match. However, Medicaid spending already accounts for one out of every three state dollars. As Medicaid enrollment is projected to spike by as much as 70 percent or more compared to 2019 levels, with states needing to fund as much as $128 billon, this provision adds to the states’ already existing financial burden by requiring states to keep those who are not actually eligible for benefits enrolled in the program.
“As this provision stretches state budgets, it may also divert state resources from the truly needy towards those who are ineligible for the program. That is unacceptable. Moving forward, we must correct this statutory provision and instead grant states more flexibility so they can focus their resources on the truly needy.
“Thank you for your attention to this matter. We stand ready to work with you to remedy the problems this provision has caused and enact a solution that will safeguard state budgets and the program’s integrity.”

Title: Sen. Lee Announces Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing on Online Advertising Market
Date: July 27, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights Chairman Mike Lee (R-UT) announced a hearing will be held at 2pm on September 15, 2020, titled, “Stacking the Tech: Has Google Harmed Competition in Online Advertising?”
Google is the dominant player in online advertising, a business that accounts for around 85% of its revenues and which allows it to monetize the data it collects through the products it offers for free. Recent consumer complaints and investigations by law enforcement have raised questions about whether Google has acquired or maintained its market power in online advertising in violation of the antitrust laws. News reports indicate this may also be the centerpiece of a forthcoming antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. This hearing will examine these allegations and provide a forum to assess the most important antitrust investigation of the 21st century.
“Like many Americans across the political spectrum, I have been concerned by the exercise of market power held by Google and other tech giants,” said Sen. Lee. “This hearing will be an opportunity to dig deeper into those concerns, building off of earlier Antitrust subcommittee hearings. It will hopefully reaffirm the wisdom of focusing on better enforcement rather than the radical transformation of the antitrust laws demanded by the extreme left.”
"Google is a force online, dominating internet search and technology services that deliver targeted ads to consumers. For years, we have heard complaints that Google has used multiple acquisitions and its unmatched advantage in consumer targeting to undermine rivals and limit competition. As the Justice Department and several state enforcers investigate Google’s conduct in digital advertising markets, it is critical that the Antitrust Subcommittee focus on the lack of competition in these online markets and the impact on consumers,” Klobuchar said.

Title: Sen. Lee Leads Letter on First Amendment Fairness
Date: July 24, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and nine Republican colleagues sent a letter to President Trump Thursday, asking him to do everything in his power to prevent state and local governments from discriminating against Americans seeking to exercise their First Amendment right to practice their religion.
“As you are aware, there continue to be reported cases of state and localities prohibiting religious entities, including houses of worship, from reopening safely despite compliance with safety precautions found in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance such as social distancing, building and surface sanitization, use of mask, etc. This discriminatory behaviour violates our Constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom, specifically the free exercise guarantee,” the letter reads in part.
“We, therefore, respectfully request that you consider taking additional measures within your authority to ensure churches, houses of worship, and religious institutions are able to reopen with appropriate CDC implemented guidelines,” the letter continues. “Your resolve and leadership on this issue would deliver a strong message in these most troubling
times.”
In addition to Sen. Lee,
the letter
is signed by Sens. Mike Braun (R-IN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), James Lankford (R-OK), and Tom Cotton (R-AR).

Title: Senate Passes NDAA With Lee-Backed Amendments
Date: July 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – On Thursday, the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 with several adopted amendments supported by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).
“I am committed to working for my fellow Utahns who bravely serve in the armed forces and ensuring their voices are heard in Congress,” Sen. Lee said. “These amendments are win-wins for the state of Utah, the members of our nation’s armed forces, and the American taxpayers.”
Included in the legislation was Sen. Lee’s Allied Burden Sharing Report amendment, which would require the Department of Defense (DoD) to submit a report on the contributions made by our allies to the common defense. This bill would allow Congress to perform its oversight over U.S. agreements with our allies to know whether they are paying their share of the costs associated with our mutual defense strategy.
Sen. Lee also worked with Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) to include language in the bill that would require the DoD to hire veterans into civilian positions without having to wait the arbitrary six months currently mandated. This destructive 180-day hiring restriction has posed an artificial barrier to entry for highly skilled veterans who are needed most and can least afford to wait, a problem that this legislation would correct.
Additionally, Sen. Lee worked with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) to include an amendment requiring the DoD to report on our nation’s Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program. This program was established by the DoD to provide the U.S. with state-of-the-art defense capabilities for chemical and biological warfare environments, and much of their critical work is undertaken at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. The passage of this amendment will ensure that Congress better understands the mission-essential work done by this program to keep our troops safe from chemical and biological contaminants.

Title: Sen. Lee Strengthens Utah Manufacturing with ‘Made in USA’ Labeling Win
Date: July 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) secured passage of the Reinforcing American-Made Products Act Wednesday, a bill that strengthens Utah manufacturing by creating one national “Made in USA” labeling standard.
“Now more than ever Americans care about the ‘Made in USA’ label and they should because it shows consumers a product is of high quality and supports good jobs here in America,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately, some states have empowered trial lawyers to get rich off of differing state standards and this bill solves that problem by making one national standard for the ‘Made in USA’ label.”
The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would ensure that the federal government maintains authority in setting country-of-origin labeling standards and that states do not create a patchwork of different standards governing interstate and exported goods. One state has complicated our country standard, setting a rigid 100 percent threshold and exposing manufacturers to unnecessary litigation. The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would fix that by creating one national standard.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces State Based NEPA Reform
Date: July 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the NEPA State Assignment Expansion Act Thursday, a bill that would allow states to assume the regulatory burdens of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process.
“Utah has had an agreement with the Department of Transportation to take on all responsibility and liability for complying with NEPA for years, and it has been a huge success,” Sen. Lee said. “This legislation would bring that success to other federal agencies thus reducing regulatory burdens and delays for infrastructure projects throughout the state and the nation.”
In 1970, Congress passed NEPA to ensure federal agencies were analyzing the environmental consequences for proposed federal actions or projects. In the 50 years since NEPA’s enactment, its process has substantially deviated from its original purpose and goals, evolving into an increasingly complex, bureaucratic process that has dramatically increased the cost and timeline to complete projects.
The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program permits all states to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the assignment of NEPA responsibilities for Federal highway projects. States that assume these Federal responsibilities become solely responsible and liable for carrying out these responsibilities in the place of the Federal Highway Administration.
Utah is one of seven states who have assumed this responsibility with great success, providing an opportunity for states to leverage their unique understanding of their own state to better carry out NEPA’s requirements.
This bill requires each federal agency to set up a program similar to the existing Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program so that any state may voluntarily assume the applicable agency’s NEPA responsibilities.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces NEPA Data Transparency and Accountability Act
Date: July 22, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the NEPA Data Transparency and Accountability Act Wednesday, a bill that would empower Americans to know the bureaucratic costs of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by requiring each federal agency to report to Congress on their NEPA activity every year.
“What was meant to be a good-government planning process has, over 50 years, become a weapon used by those who oppose economic development to delay and prevent infrastructure projects throughout the country,” Sen. Lee said. “This legislation would allow Americans to understand the true costs of the antiquated NEPA system.”
Enacted in 1970, NEPA was designed to ensure federal agencies were analyzing the environmental consequences for proposed federal actions or projects. Over the past 50 years its process has substantially deviated from its original purpose and goals, evolving into an increasingly complex, bureaucratic process that has dramatically increased the cost and timeline to complete projects. Some studies put the average delay from NEPA alone at over five years per project.
The NEPA Data Transparency and Accountability Act would:
Require each Federal agency to annually report to Congress: (1) the number of categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental impact statements issued in the last fiscal year, (2) the time it took to approve such proposed actions, and (3) the number of proposed actions that are under NEPA review as of the date the report is issued.
Require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the CEQ to jointly develop a methodology to assess the comprehensive costs of the NEPA process and require each federal agency to adopt that methodology and report (1) the comprehensive cost of the NEPA process for each proposed action completed within the reporting period, and (2) for pending NEPA actions, the amount of money currently expended for the project and the estimated future costs to complete the analysis.

Title: Sens. Lee, Leahy Demand Answers From Trump Administration On Potentially Unauthorized And Illegal Mass Surveillance Programs
Date: July 21, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to Attorney General William Barr and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Tuesday, demanding information on whether and how the Trump administration has halted mass surveillance programs authorized by now-expired Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provisions under the USA FREEDOM Act. The senators also demanded information on whether the administration is conducting surveillance that bypasses their statutory authorities, under any illegal claim of inherent surveillance powers.
Past administrations have tenuously relied on Executive Order 12333, issued in 1981, to conduct surveillance operations wholly independent of any statutory authorization. With the expiration of three duly-passed statutory surveillance authorities, the executive branch may be secretly relying on this or other alleged inherent powers to continue its intelligence collection efforts. This would constitute a secret system of surveillance with no congressional oversight potentially resulting in programmatic Fourth Amendment violations on a tremendous scale.
“Congress and the American people have a right to know if this or any other administration is spying on people in the United States outside of express congressional approval, with no or diminished guardrails,” wrote the senators.
The senators continued:
“The rights of all Americans depend on their government exercising its power responsibly, adhering to the rule of law, and upholding its duty to act transparently. Any surveillance conducted in the absence of statutory authorities and congressional oversight would be extraordinarily concerning and illegal.”
Leahy and Lee authored the USA FREEDOM Act in 2015, which provided the first major overhaul of executive surveillance authorities in decades. In May, the senators also authored an amendment to H.R. 6172, the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020, to strengthen the amici process and improve the disclosure of exculpatory evidence in the FISA court system. That amendment was overwhelmingly approved in the Senate by a vote of 77 to 19 and the underlying legislation, with the Lee-Leahy amendment included, then passed the Senate by a vote of 80 to 16.

Title: Sen. Lee Backs Bipartisan Bill to Reform Civil Asset Forfeiture Laws
Date: June 26, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON
–
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Angus King (I-ME), and Mike Crapo (R-ID) to reintroduce the bipartisan Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act, S. 4074, to protect property owners’ rights, defend innocent Americans, and restore the Fifth Amendment’s role in civil forfeiture proceedings.
“The federal government has made it far too easy for government agencies to take and profit from the property of those who have not been convicted of a crime. The FAIR Act will uphold the Fifth Amendment and ensure government agencies no longer profit from taking American citizens’ property without due process. It will guard against abuse while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime,”
said Sen. Paul.
“Any seizure of property must be based on clear and convincing evidence,”
said Sen. King.
“When financial motivations are allowed to enter the decision-making process associated with civil asset forfeiture, we run the risk of losing our focus on the pursuit of justice. This is unacceptable – it is past time to reform these laws, and refer to the due process principles that are enshrined in the Bill of Rights.”
“Requiring Americans to prove their property should not have been taken by the government, rather than the government proving guilt, undermines our system of justice,”
said Sen. Crapo.
“Commonsense restraints must be instituted to end civil asset forfeiture abuses. The FAIR Act would put the burden of proof where it should be—on the government, not innocent Americans.”
“While we certainly want to ensure that law enforcement has the tools they need to fight crime, the federal government should not be wrongfully taking our citizens’ private property and denying them due process under the law,”
said Sen. Lee.
“The FAIR Act provides some much-needed protections for Americans’ Fifth Amendment rights.”
Senator Paul will also offer this reform as an amendment to any police reform bill the Senate considers.
You can read the legislation
HERE
, and you can find more information below:
S. 4074, The Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act
:
Eliminates “Equitable” Sharing:
The federal “equitable” sharing program allows state law enforcement officers to turn seized property over to federal officials for forfeiture — and get up to 80% of the proceeds of the forfeited property. The FAIR Act ends “equitable” sharing and ensures that law enforcement cannot ignore state law.
Restores Principle of “Innocent Until Proven Guilty”:
Under current law, federal law enforcement agencies may take property
suspected of involvement in crime without charging the property owner with a crime. The FAIR Act places on the government the burden to show that a property owner consented to his property being used in a crime by a third party (or that the property owner
was willfully blind to the criminal activity).
Requires Clear and Convincing Evidence:
The FAIR Act would require that the government prove its case by the higher standard
of clear and convincing evidence, instead of a current standard that only requires a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant’s property was used for an illegal purpose.
Protects the Right to Counsel:
Under current law, property owners can receive appointed counsel due to indigency only if (1)
they request it, and (2) their home has been seized. The FAIR Act would ensure that owners have the opportunity to receive representation in all civil forfeiture proceedings.
Removes the Profit
Incentive:
Law enforcement should be motivated by public safety, not financial rewards. The FAIR Act would restore the rule in which the proceeds of forfeiture go to the Treasury’s General Fund, where Congress can appropriate the money for any purpose.
Reforms IRS Seizures:
The FAIR Act requires that the IRS prove that the defendant knowingly deposited funds with criminal intent
before they can seize the property. It also requires that a probable cause hearing be held no later than 14 days after the IRS seizes funds under the pretense of a structuring violation.
Enacts Strong Reporting
Requirements:
The Department of Justice will be required to compile and publish the percentage of its seizures that were subjected to civil and criminal asset forfeiture.
Awards Treble Damages to a Successful Plaintiff:
Currently, forfeited property is often not worth the cost of litigation. Trebling
the damages would provide both a disincentive for forfeiture to occur in the first place and an incentive for plaintiffs to bring an action in court.
Eliminates IRS and Customs Carveouts for Basic Protections Otherwise Granted by Federal Law:
Today, in U.S. Customs and IRS
cases, property owners are denied basic protections provided by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA), due to Congress specifically making exceptions for those two agencies in that law. The FAIR Act would remove these carveouts for Customs and the IRS.
Eliminates All References to Administrative Seizures in the U.S. Code:
Administrative forfeitures happen automatically when property owners fail to challenge a seizure in court for any reason, including the inability to afford a lawyer or a missed deadline to file a claim. The seized property is simply presumed “guilty” without a neutral arbiter such as a judge determining whether it should be permanently taken from its owner. According to the Institute for Justice, administrative forfeitures account for 88 percent of all forfeitures. This provision would effectively force the government to go to court to keep property it has seized.

Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Approves Durbin, Lee Inspector General Access Act
Date: June 25, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee today on a 21-1 vote reported the Inspector General Access Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) that would expand the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (IOG) to include alleged DOJ attorney misconduct. Currently, the DOJ Inspector General (IG) has no authority to investigate professional misconduct by DOJ lawyers. DOJ is the only agency whose IG has such a jurisdictional carve-out. The Inspector General Access Act would simply strike this loophole, which leads to an unfair double standard where every DOJ employee – including FBI and DEA agents, U.S. Marshals, and federal prison guards – can be investigated by the DOJ IG except DOJ lawyers. Companion legislation passed the House of Representatives unanimously last year.
“This is a simple bill that would close a glaring loophole in the law,” Durbin said. “This is not a partisan issue. None of us know whether the Attorney General next year will be appointed by President Trump or President Biden. But we should all agree that whoever the Attorney General is, he or she should be subject to independent oversight. I’m thankful to Senator Lee for his leadership and partnership on this important bill.”
“Our federal government inspectors general do a valuable job providing the information voters and lawmakers need to hold federal government agencies accountable,” Lee said. “Unfortunately, the Department of Justice OIG currently does not have the power to review the conduct of DOJ attorneys, an oversight which this legislation corrects.”
The Inspector General Access Act solves the problems that have long prevented independent oversight of DOJ prosecutors by simply striking the jurisdictional carve out in § 8E of the Inspector General Act. As a result, DOJ’s Inspector General would be fully empowered to investigate allegations of professional misconduct against Department lawyers. In addition to enhancing oversight and public accountability at DOJ, this simple, common sense reform will bring DOJ in line with the practices in other federal agencies where allegations of attorney professional misconduct are already subject to investigation by Inspectors General.
Along with Durbin and Lee, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).
The bill is supported by a broad coalition of advocates from across the political spectrum, including the ACLU, the American Conservative Union, Freedom Works, the Project on Government Oversight, and the Due Process Institute.

Title: Sen. Lee Cosponsors Bill Expanding Federal Tax Deduction for Charitable Giving
Date: June 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today introduced the bipartisan
Universal Giving Pandemic Response Act
to expand the current above-the-line deduction for charitable giving made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March, The bill would ensure that Americans who donate to charities, houses of worship, religious organizations, and other nonprofits are able to deduct that donation from their federal taxes at a higher level than the current $300 deduction.
Specifically, the bill would make available—for tax years 2019 and 2020—an above-the-line deduction for charitable giving on federal income taxes valued at up to one-third of the standard deduction (around $4,000 for an individual filer and $8,000 for married joint filers).
“The Coronavirus continues to disrupt all of our lives, but it also presents three unique challenges to our nation's charitable organizations,” said Lee. “First, charitable organizations that help our most vulnerable communities are seeing increased demand for their services. Second, the virus has complicated how these organizations deliver their services. And third, most charities have suffered a decline in donations as Americans have felt the financial pain of less work and unemployment. Congress can help by allowing all taxpayers to claim a greater portion of the charitable deduction for tax years 2019 and 2020. This would help more Americans donate to charitable organizations.”
“Nonprofits uphold Americans in our times of greatest need. Now it is time for Americans to uphold nonprofits in their moment of need,” said Lankford. “Our families need strong nonprofits to meet their essential needs. They are the private safety net before the public safety net. Our nation’s charities help millions of people both in Oklahoma and across the nation access food, shelter, clothes, employment assistance, and mental and physical health services without forcing them to wait on the government. This proposal incentives additional giving during a time of crisis in our nation. I am proud of the incredible work our bipartisan group of senators has done to help ease the federal tax burden for those who give to charities.”
“As we face three national crises—a pandemic, recession, and the wounds of structural racism—Americans have responded with a tremendous spirit of generosity,” said Coons. “People of all means are trying to help by giving what they can to help our nation heal and recover, but there’s a divide among Americans who give. One in seven Americans saves their receipt for a tax deduction. The other six, typically of lesser means, do not. That’s unjust, and it’s ineffective. If more Americans were acknowledged for and supported in their donations, there would be more giving, period. That’s why I am proud to support The Universal Giving Pandemic Response Act to substantially increase the 2020 emergency charitable giving incentive, to adequately reflect the magnitude of goodwill that so many are showing, and many others are capable of as we work to overcome these crises together.”
“COVID-19 has once again demonstrated how important non-profit and faith-based services are to our communities,” said Shaheen. “Since day one, non-profit organizations have been working tirelessly to help those in need despite steep declines in donations. Congress has the power to encourage charitable giving through the tax code to make sure these organizations have the resources they need to continue their vital work and weather the financial challenges they face. I’m glad to partner with Senator Lankford and this bipartisan coalition to create an above-the-line deduction for all charitable contributions. This is a common-sense measure that Senate Leadership should act on quickly.”
“Earlier this year as the CARES Act was being drafted, I worked with my Senate colleagues to ensure non-profits and churches would receive support,” said Scott. “Thankfully, a new above-the-line charitable giving deduction was created to foster additional giving. I am glad to continue working with my colleagues on this issue to increase this deduction and ensure our nation’s non-profits continue receiving the support they so badly need, especially during this difficult time.”
“Nonprofits are on the front lines of this crisis, but as demand for their services soars, many of these organizations are struggling to keep their doors open,” said Klobuchar. “This bill will expand the universal tax deduction for charitable giving to help nonprofits continue to serve their communities during the pandemic.”

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on FTC Contact Lens Regulation
Date: June 23, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after the Federal Trade Commission issued a new regulation designed to improve competition in the contact lens market.
“I have urged the FTC to pursue updates to its Contact Lens Rule for years and am looking forward to thoroughly reviewing these updates issued today,” Sen. Lee said. “It is essential that consumers be made aware of their rights regarding access to their contact lens prescription allowing them to shop for lenses in a competitive market.”
Sen. Lee sent a letter to the FTC asking them to investigate anticompetitive practices in the contact lens market back in 2016. “The rights of contact lens consumers are being repeatedly and openly violated by prescribers who refuse to comply with the FTC’s Contact Lens Rule, which requires doctors to give patients a copy of their prescription so that patients can choose for themselves where they purchase their contact lenses,” Sen. Lee wrote at the time.

Title: The Facts about Google, Antitrust, and the First Amendment
Date: June 19, 2020

Content:
Many of you have asked about claims made by Tucker Carlson that Sen. Mike Lee “has taken the side of big tech companies over your constitutional rights.”
Nothing could be further from the truth.
To better understand what is really going on, please do read the following fact check of Tucker Carlson’s claims below.
Tucker:
“Thanks to a special carve out Google has received from the United States Congress, something called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Google itself is not responsible for the content on its platform because the Congress says it doesn’t have to be.”
Reality:
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed by Congress in 1996. Google didn't even exist until 1998. Since Section 230 was passed two years before Google even existed it is impossible for it to be a “special carve out Google” received from the government. Section 230 protects online platforms (like a website, app, etc.) from being liable for the content created by someone on their online platform. Under Section 230, all companies operating online platforms are responsible for their own content that they create on their platform. But they are not responsible for the content that is created by another person or company who uses their platform. The person who creates the content is responsible for the content.
Tucker:
“Immunity is a very nice thing to have if you are a big company, Fox News doesn’t have it. But again, thanks to Congress Google does have immunity.”
Reality:
Section 230 applies to all companies equally. When Fox News operates its website, they do in fact have the exact same Section 230 protections that Google does. FoxNews.com has a comments section. And just as Google would be immune from any slanderous comments made by a commenter in a YouTube comments section, FoxNews.com is also immune from any slanderous comment made by a commenter in their comments section.
Tucker:
“We would love to ask Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) about this… Why do we ask him? Because Lee chairs the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is the man that could do something to protect you from Google.”
Reality:
Section 230 is telecommunications law. It has nothing to do with antitrust law. The Communications Decency Act is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Antitrust Subcommittee. If people believe Section 230 is the key to protecting the American people from Google then they should look to amend communications law, not antitrust law.
Sen. Lee does share Tucker’s concern about liberal progressive bias at Google, Facebook, Twitter, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and National Public Radio.
What the NBC News’ “Verification Unit”
tried to do to The Federalist
is absolutely a threat to honest and open speech in the United States. Conservatives should speak out against progressive attempts to silence conservative voices.
And Sen. Lee did exactly that.
But our nation’s antitrust laws, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, were not designed, nor are they equipped, to regulate political bias in technology or media companies.
If we are going to be successful in protecting Americans constitutional rights against progressive activists that want to silence Americans they disagree with, we need to be accurately informed about what the real dangers to our civil rights are. If we waste our time misunderstanding when laws were passed, why they were passed, and what they actually do, we will only make it easier for progressives to win.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on NBC’s Attempt to Use Google to Silence Other Media Outlets
Date: June 17, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday in response to an NBC News attempt to silence The Federalist.
“The Federalist is an essential, transparent news media outlet that publishes a diverse array of voices. It employs dogged, must-read reporters who seek the truth by following the facts, and resists the adolescent groupthink that defines so much of the mainstream political press. It analyzes and criticizes politicians and ideas across the ideological spectrum. And its coverage of the world outside politics - of culture, sports, religion and more - is some of the best on the Internet. The Federalist is the type of journalistic organization NBC should aspire to become when it grows up.
“Meanwhile, by acquiescing to this Orwellian sting operation, Google has leant its corporate credibility to a fraudulent, partisan hit job.
“As progressive liberal activists and their journalist collaborators increase their campaign to silence voices that don’t toe their party line, it is incumbent that Google transparently explain how exactly it handled NBC’s attempt to silence The Federalist so that its corporate policies don’t become a weapon for these online mobs.
“If Google thinks websites should be punished for content generated by users on their own sites, that might be a good question for Congress to consider.”

Title: FCC Responds to Sen. Lee Letter on Ligado 5G License Decision
Date: June 16, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) replied to a letter sent by Sens. Mike Lee, Brian Schatz, Ron Johnson, Edward J. Markey, Ted Cruz, Mark R. Warner, John Thune, and Chris Coons earlier this month, asking the FCC to address issues surrounding the agency’s decision to modify Ligado’s 5G spectrum license. The letter asked 13 questions designed to provide the FCC with a fair opportunity to explain the basis of their decision after the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing opposing the FCC’s unanimous, bipartisan decision without hearing testimony in support.
“I appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions and clear up some misinformation that has been disseminated regarding the Commission’s Ligado Decision,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai notes. “[W]e found that Ligado’s modified application could support 5G and Internet of Things services through an innovative approach to make more efficient use of underused spectrum in the 1525-1536 MHz portion of the mobile satellite band while protecting GPS users in the nearby 1559-1610 MHz radionavigation satellite band.”

Title: Sen. Lee Thanks Interior for Transferring Water Projects to Utah
Date: June 16, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) thanked Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman for notifying Congress of the federal government’s intent to transfer ownership of two federal water projects in Utah to local water user organizations.
“It’s not every day that the federal government gives land back to local communities, but we are 90 days away from such a minor miracle becoming reality,” Sen. Lee said. “For far too long local communities have been deprived of the right to own, control, and manage these projects that they have paid for and that are essential to the life of the community. I want to thank Secretary Bernhardt and Commissioner Burman for their outstanding leadership in making this day a reality. I hope these are just the first of many transfers to come.”
The two projects, which will be transferred to local control after a 90-day congressional waiting period, are the Emery County Project in east-central Utah and the Uintah Basin Replacement Project in northeastern Utah.
Upon conveyance of title, the Moon Lake Water Users Association will take ownership of the Uintah Basin Replacement Project, and the Emery County Water Conservancy District will take ownership of the Emery County Project. The two water projects have been fully paid for by the water districts they are being transferred to. Although ownership would change, these water users will continue to manage these facilities to meet current needs in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and within the terms of the title transfer agreement.

Title: Sen. Lee Signs Bipartisan Letter Questioning Juniper Networks Over Secret Government Backdoors
Date: June 11, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), along with 13 members of the U.S. House, signing a letter asking Juniper Networks to explain how an NSA-designed backdoor appeared in its products and how the key to this backdoor was later changed by unknown parties.
Juniper first revealed a security breach in late 2015 in which unauthorized code was added to its products. Cybersecurity experts subsequently determined that Juniper had added an NSA-designed algorithm to its products as far back as 2008, and that the breach that Juniper revealed in 2015 involved an unknown entity changing the key to the existing backdoor.
According to the experts, this backdoor could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries to decipher encrypted data transmitted between Juniper-manufactured equipment, which is widely used by the U.S. government and private sector. However, despite promising a full investigation, Juniper has never publicly accounted for the incident.
“It has now been over four years since Juniper announced it was conducting an investigation, but your company has still not revealed what, if anything, it uncovered. The American people — and the companies and U.S. government agencies that trusted Juniper’s products with their sensitive data — still have no information about why Juniper quietly added an NSA-designed, likely-backdoored encryption algorithm, or how, years later, the keys to that probable backdoor were changed by an unknown entity, likely to the detriment of U.S. national security,” the members wrote.
The letter comes in the midst of Attorney General William Barr’s efforts to pressure technology companies to weaken their encryption and assist government surveillance.
“Juniper’s experiences can provide a valuable case study about the dangers of backdoors, as well as the apparent ease with which government backdoors can be covertly subverted by a sophisticated actor,” the members continued.
The members asked Juniper to answer a list of detailed questions by July 10. A copy of today’s letter is available

Title: Sen. Lee to Participate in Conference Call with Utah Charities
Date: June 8, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee will answer questions during a conference call hosted by the Utah Nonprofits Association Monday, a call that will focus on what Congress can do to help charitable organizations cope with the challenges created by COVID-19.
“The Coronavirus continues to disrupt all of our lives, but it also presents three unique challenges to our nation's charitable organizations,” Sen. Lee said. “First, charitable organizations that help our most vulnerable communities are seeing increased demand for their services. Second, the virus has disrupted how many of these organizations deliver their services. And third, most charities have suffered a decline in donations as Americans have felt the financial pain of less work and unemployment.”
“Congress can help by allowing all taxpayers to claim a greater portion of the charitable deduction for tax years 2019 and 2020. This would help more Americans donate to charitable organizations.”

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on Eviction of Utah National Guard from D.C. Hotel
Date: June 5, 2020

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser evicted 200 Utah National Guard specialists from their hotel just hours after the soldiers came off duty protecting the people of D.C.
“Evicting Utah National Guard personnel from their hotels after a late-night shift risking their lives to protect Washington is a shameful, petty, discrediting decision by Mayor Bowser.
“Our Utah guardsmen are consummate professionals who are not complaining in the slightest. But their labor and sacrifice on behalf of Washingtonians deserves better than this embarrassing spectacle. If Mayor Bowser has a problem with President Trump she should take it up with him, not take it out on National Guard personnel in the middle of a dangerous deployment in her city,” Sen. Lee finished.
The 200 Utah National Guard specialists, who were deployed to Washington on short notice earlier this week, finished their all-night Thursday shift protecting D.C. at 3 am on Friday. They were forced out of their hotel by 11 am. They have another shift Friday evening at 6 pm until 2 am Saturday morning.

Title: Sen. Lee Seeks FCC Comment on Modification of Ligado’s Spectrum License
Date: June 4, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Thursday to ensure that Members of Congress and the American public are better informed about the FCC’s decision to modify Ligado’s spectrum license.
Recently, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing that opposed the FCC’s decision to issue the Ligado license but they failed to call any witnesses or solicit any testimony in support of the license modification despite the fact that the FCC’s decision garnered the bipartisan support of every FCC Commissioner. Sen. Lee’s letter asks eleven questions designed to provide the FCC with a fair opportunity to explain the basis of their decision.
“There is no doubt that in order for the United States to meet its demand for spectrum, we need an effective spectrum strategy that continues to enable innovation while avoiding harmful interference identified by science-based engineering and technical analysis. We look forward to hearing back from you,” the letter reads.

Title: Sen. Lee Urges Administration To Phase Out Regulations Suspended Due To COVID
Date: June 3, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) signed a letter with Sens. David Perdue (R-GA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) asking Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought to phase out all federal regulations that have been waived during the COVID-19 crisis and allow the rules to go back through the regulatory review process to determine if they need to be maintained, modified, or permanently repealed.
“As the United States begins to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and their employees will continue to face obstacles as they work to navigate a new and more challenging environment,” wrote the senators. “We think it is essential that the federal government do more to provide a roadmap for businesses that is paved without unnecessary roadblocks and burdensome regulations.”
The senators cited several regulations that have been waived to improve COVID-19 response efforts and provide greater flexibility during the pandemic. For example, because overly burdensome rules were suspended, doctors have been able to practice medicine across state lines and provide telehealth services for Medicare patients.
“We urge you to sunset all federal regulations that have been waived and continue to be waived during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the rules to go back through the regulatory process to determine whether these regulations should be temporary or permanent,” continued the senators. “It is imperative the federal government continues to lessen the burden of unnecessary regulations in a systematic manner moving forward since we do not know where the next crisis may strike.

Title: Sen. Lee and Colleagues Introduce Bill to Let States Approve and Distribute Diagnostic Tests During Public Health Emergency
Date: May 19, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – As states begin to safely re-open and Americans return to work, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) cosponsored the Right to Test Act – legislation to let states approve and distribute diagnostic tests when the state or federal government has declared a public health emergency. The bill was written by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and cosponsored by Sens. Lee, Mike Braun (R-IN), and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA).
This legislation will empower states to reduce testing delays and more rapidly respond to the evolving health needs of their communities as they work to curb the spread of COVID-19 and future health threats.
“Our federal bureaucracy simply has not moved fast enough during this crisis,” Sen. Lee said. “We need to empower the creativity of Americans to solve this crisis and allowing states to cut through regulatory delays will do just that.”
“As states navigate the next steps in their response to the coronavirus pandemic, it’s essential that Congress remove bureaucratic barriers that limit the availability of tests,” Sen. Cruz said. “The Right to Test Act is a commonsense solution that will empower states to more effectively reduce the spread of this virus.”
“Testing is so important to getting the American economy booming again, and we can’t afford more bureaucratic setbacks when it comes to getting those tests to Americans and businesses,” Sen. Braun said. “I’m proud to add my name to Senator Cruz’s Right to Test Act to allow states to be agile in responding to their communities in a way the federal government cannot.”
“As we enter a new phase in our response to the coronavirus pandemic, strengthening testing capabilities remains a top priority,” Sen. Loeffler said. “The Right to Test Act will empower states to expand their diagnostic capacity in future pandemics without needless delay and will bolster America’s flexibility to provide tests for those who need them.”

WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined 27 other senators in signing a letter to leadership urging the Senate to take action to provide businesses with regulatory relief in the wake of the economic crisis caused by the global pandemic.
“In contrast to unsustainable increases in federal spending, the easing of regulatory burdens – estimated to cost businesses as much as $1.9 trillion – will have broader macroeconomic effects by promoting competition and private investment,” the Senators write. “We stand ready to work with you to adopt commonsense regulatory relief in an effort to promote long-term economic recovery following the COVID-19 healthcare crisis.

Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:
We applaud your bipartisan leadership and cooperation in responding to the unprecedented health and economic crisis that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In that spirit, we write to urge the consideration of statutory changes to significantly reduce red tape, paperwork, and other regulatory requirements as an important step to respond to COVID-19 in general, and economic recovery in particular.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there have been massive changes around the world to cope with the pandemic.  Domestically, we have seen federal, state, and local governments struggle to protect at-risk populations through social distancing, mandatory business closures, and various shelter-in-place strategies.  These measures do appear to help “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 infections, but they are taking a devastating toll on the economy, jobs, and people’s lives.
Since March 5, 2020, the Senate has passed four packages of legislation to respond to this extraordinary health and economic disaster.  Moving forward, we must include statutory changes that permit regulatory relief for businesses small and large across every sector of the economy.
Regulatory reform, whether through paperwork reduction or removing outmoded compliance requirements, is the most efficient means of promoting economic recovery.  This approach avoids the pitfalls of waste, fraud, and abuse that always accompany increased government spending.  In contrast to unsustainable increases in federal spending, the easing of regulatory burdens – estimated to cost businesses as much as $1.9 trillion – will have broader macroeconomic effects by promoting competition and private investment.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.  We stand ready to work with you to adopt commonsense regulatory relief in an effort to promote long-term economic recovery following the COVID-19 healthcare crisis.

Title: Senate Passes Lee-Leahy FISA Amendment
Date: May 13, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after the Senate voted 77-19 to adopt the Lee-Leahy Amendment to USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020.
“If men were angels, no government would be necessary. But men are not angels so our government will always need oversight and accountability to make sure it doesn’t abuse its power. The Lee-Leahy Amendment just passed by the Senate will help bring some much-needed oversight and accountability to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. More work still needs to be done, but this is good reform in the right direction, and I look forward to final passage of this FISA reform legislation.”
The Lee-Leahy amendment will strengthen third-party oversight of the FISA process. Specifically, it requires FISA court judges to appoint an amicus curae (a neutral third-party observer) in any case involving a “sensitive investigative matter” so long as the FISA court does not determine it to be inappropriate.
The amendment will also empower the amicus to raise any issue with the court at any time and give both the amicus and the FISA court access to all documents and information related to the surveillance application.
Final passage of the legislation is expected Thursday.

Title: Sen. Lee Signs Letter Asking President Trump to Reject State Bailouts
Date: April 30, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –
Today, Sens. Mike Lee, Rick Scott, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Enzi sent a letter to President Trump urging the Administration to reject states’ efforts to receive taxpayer dollars for non-Coronavirus related expenses, like bail-outs for unfunded pensions or to backfill lost revenue.
Read the Senators’ letter
HERE
or below.
April 30, 2020
The Honorable Donald J. Trump
President
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. President:
We write to thank your administration for taking bold steps to combat the Coronavirus and keep Americans safe. As our efforts to respond to – and ultimately defeat – the Coronavirus continue, state and local governments are at the front lines of this war. They are working tirelessly to protect our communities – an enormous task in this difficult time, and have received federal funding through the CARES Act specifically directed to aid in their efforts to keep families safe.
Unfortunately, we are hearing reports that some states and localities are advocating that a potential future Coronavirus response measure be used as a piggy bank for unrelated expenses that have nothing to do with responding to the Coronavirus. As your administration works with Congress on any additional phases of Coronavirus response, we urge you to reject efforts by some states to use federal tax dollars for reasons unrelated to combatting Coronavirus. We believe additional money sent to the states for “lost revenue” or without appropriate safeguards will be used to bail out unfunded pensions, reward decades of state mismanagement, and incentivize states to become more reliant on federal taxpayers. Again, we are supportive of funding to respond to the Coronavirus and protect our frontline workers, but we cannot allow states and localities to get a blank check from American taxpayers to fund areas of their budget that have nothing to do with the Coronavirus.
States like New York are calling for billions in unrestricted aid — not just money for Coronavirus recovery, but for pre-existing state programs and debts. New York’s rainy day fund is one of the lowest in the nation, and the state owes over $450 billion in unfunded pension and post-employment benefits. Other states are in even worse shape. Illinois has already requested a $40 billion bailout, most of which would go to pension and budget shortfalls caused by decades of fiscal mismanagement.
And let’s not forget, this year’s federal budget deficit will be the largest in the history of our nation, in excess of the cumulative deficits for the first 200 years of our country’s existence. We will end the year with in excess of $25 trillion in federal debt.
Americans expect that their tax dollars will be used for Coronavirus response, not to backfill decades of bad fiscal policy. As we continue to work to help families across the nation, we respectfully ask that you oppose bailouts for states.
America has faced many crises throughout our history – crises that demanded difficult decisions. Coronavirus is no different. Governments at every level must work together to spend taxpayer dollars wisely to end the Coronavirus crisis.

Title: Sens. Lee, Klobuchar Call on Law Enforcement to Investigate Meat Supply Chain
Date: April 27, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, and Mike Lee (R-UT), Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, wrote a letter to the Justice Department, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), calling on the agencies to identify problems and implement appropriate solutions to help ensure that our country’s food markets work for consumers, as well as our farmers, ranchers, and packers.
“With many restaurants now closed, food suppliers have struggled to adjust to new consumption patterns to the detriment of consumers, as well as participants up and down the meat supply chain. Livestock producers – especially independent livestock producers – are feeling the pain of these disruptions acutely,” the senators wrote.
“We urge you to work to identify the root causes of these disruptions so we can work together to implement appropriate solutions.”
The full text of the letter can be found
HERE
and below:
Dear Attorney General Barr, Chairman Tarbert, and Secretary Perdue:
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed troubling vulnerabilities in our meat supply chain that are harming both American livestock producers and consumers. We urge you to work to identify the root causes of these disruptions so we can work together to implement appropriate solutions.
As Americans have gone to buy groceries during this pandemic, they have often been confronted by higher prices for beef and pork products, or in some circumstances, nearly empty meat cases. With many restaurants now closed, food suppliers have struggled to adjust to new consumption patterns to the detriment of consumers, as well as participants up and down the meat supply chain. Livestock producers – especially independent livestock producers – are feeling the pain of these disruptions acutely.
Since the initial phases of the nationwide shut-down, we have seen once again the disparate impact catastrophic events have on cattle and hog producers as compared to their meat packer and processor counterparts. Livestock prices have fallen dramatically since the first weeks of the crisis, with live cattle futures falling by 29 percent and hog futures falling by 39 percent between the middle of January and the first week in April while beef and pork prices at the grocery store rose dramatically. As during past market disruptions, we saw producers’ margins fall to unsustainable levels while packers’ margins increased.
In more recent weeks, the spread of the virus has forced closures at major meat packing facilities. While some facilities have closed temporarily, others have been shuttered indefinitely. These closures, and the resulting uncertainty, force producers to make difficult decisions that could threaten our food supply or result in unnecessary increased costs for consumers. During this worldwide pandemic when unprecedented numbers of families are standing in food lines, we cannot afford to waste available food resources that could be utilized if only there were available options for processing and packing.
We recognize the complex nature of these markets and the potential multi-faceted causes of these supply chain disruptions that disproportionately impact independent livestock producers, such as the dominance of formula pricing – which bases livestock pricing on low volume cash markets – or highly concentrated meat packing markets with high entry barriers for new competitors. There have also been allegations of potential market manipulation or anticompetitive conduct.
In light of the above, we ask that each of you, in your respective capacities, investigate the vulnerabilities in these markets that have been exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and identify areas of concern, regulations that can be modified or relaxed, any verifiable antitrust violations, and/or structural changes in the trading market to help ensure that our country’s food markets work for consumers, as well as our farmers, ranchers, and packers.
We look forward to working with you on this important issue.

Title: Sen. Lee Delivers Floor Remarks on the Need for Senate to Reconvene
Date: April 22, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) yesterday spoke on the Senate floor on the essential need for the Senate to reconvene and take up legislation to reopen the American economy.
“We've seen health care providers working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
We've seen the president and his staff at the White House working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.
We've seen the Centers for Disease Control and members of the public health community who have continued to work tirelessly.
Farmers and truck drivers and grocery store employees and pharmacists working to make sure that we continue to have access to the things we need in order to live.
We've seen members of the news media working overtime, even if, as is the case for many of them, they do so only to blame all of this – rather unfairly, in my opinion – on the President of the United States.
We see parents working both their jobs, both of them, and from home, and simultaneously homeschooling their children.
And yet, Congress is in recess.
This, Mr. President, is simply unacceptable. If COVID-19 requires Congress to act, then it requires Congress to convene.”

Title: Sen. Lee Signs Letter to Ensure Protection for Faith-Based Entities
Date: April 15, 2020

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY
–
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined a group of 17 senators Tuesday that signed a letter to Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jovita Carranza, Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), to thank them for the recently issued
interim final rule
on protections for faith-based entities during the continued rollout of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and related federal economic relief. The Administration also issued an
FAQ for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) programs
to clarify that faith-based entities, including houses of worship, are eligible for the PPP and EIDL and will not need to sacrifice their religious beliefs to comply.
The letter also asks the Administration to ensure that no otherwise-qualified, faith-based entity is denied relief due to its affiliation with other entities as an aspect of its religious practice. Additionally, the letter asks that the Administration allow for maximum participation by faith-based entities and monitor the action of lenders to ensure faith-based entities are not discriminated against.
“It was Congress’ intent that the $349 billion in loans for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities that was authorized under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) as well as the expansion of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL) would help businesses and nonprofits, including those with faith missions, stay afloat and keep employees on their payrolls during this time,” wrote the senators
.
“As such, we were glad to see the additional guidance and clarification issued on April 3, 2020 to make it clear to lenders and borrowers that faith-based entities are able to participate in these two loan programs.”
“As we repeatedly brought to your attention, without these assurances, many of our nation’s most impactful faith-based entities would have been unable to participate in the PPP due to undue restrictions on their sincerely held religious beliefs, thereby forcing them to choose between abandoning their faith mission or closing their doors to both employees and the communities they serve.”
Senators signing the letter included: Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Braun (R-IN), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Richard Burr (R-NC), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Todd Young (R-IN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), John Thune (R-SD), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Enzi (R-WY), and Rick Scott (R-FL).

WASHINGTON - Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Friday, in response to the U.S. Labor Department’s March 2020 jobs report.
“The unemployment report this morning understates the challenges Americans are now facing. It was going to take a once-in-a-century emergency to disrupt our booming economy. But that’s what we have on our hands. People are losing jobs every day, and millions of families and businesses are just hanging on.
“The good news is, help is on the way. Emergency business loans are coming available, and desperately needed relief checks will be direct-deposited soon.
“But for now, our task remains the same: support families, businesses, and our health care system through this crisis, so that we can all get back to work as soon and as safely as possible.”

Title: Sen. Lee Highlights Important Information for Supplemental Security Income Recipients
Date: March 31, 2020

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued a note to all Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients Tuesday, describing how SSI recipients can access the COVID-19 relief made available from the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act
. The following note is from the Congressional Research Service:
In general, individuals who did not file a federal income tax return for 2018 or 2019 and who did not receive Form SSA-1099 are ineligible for the recovery rebate in 2020.
Many SSI recipients are
not required to file a federal income tax return
. SSI payments, as well as payments from analogous social benefit programs (i.e., programs based on need), are not considered gross income for federal tax purposes under a limited
general welfare exclusion
. A
2017 study
found that 11% of nonfilers in 2006 had SSI income, compared with 1% of filers.
SSI recipients who did not file a federal income tax return for 2018 or 2019 and who did not concurrently receive Social Security benefits (i.e., did not receive Form SSA-1099) are not to receive the recovery rebate in 2020.
Such individuals are to receive the rebate if they subsequently file a 2019 tax return (the filing date has been
extended to July 15
) or file a 2020 tax return in 2021.
An SSI recipient who is claimed as a dependent on a taxpayer's return is ineligible for the rebate.
The Internal Revenue Service is encouraging anyone
who has not filed a federal income tax return for 2018 or a previous year
to act now.
The CARES Act requires the Treasury Department and the
Social Security Administration
to provide information regarding the availability of the recovery rebate, including information for individuals who may not have filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019.
As with any tax refund, the recovery rebate is
not countable as income or resources for a 12-month period
in determining eligibility for, or the amount of assistance provided by, any federal program, such as SSI, or any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds.
So if you receive SSI, did not file a tax return in 2018, and need a COVID-19 relief payment, you can still file a 2018 return and become eligible now.

Title: Sens. Lee and Leahy Comment on DOJ OIG Interim FISA Report
Date: March 31, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General released a Management Advisory Memorandum to FBI Director Christopher Wray identifying concerns with the FBI’s compliance with the “Woods Procedures” for FISA applications relating to U.S. persons.
Woods Procedures are vitally important to the integrity of the entire FISA process, as they are designed to ensure that the government presents a complete, accurate assessment of the facts to the FISA court. Based on a sampling of 29 FISA applications in eight field offices across the nation, the IG concluded that “we do not have confidence that the FBI has executed its Woods Procedures in compliance with FBI policy.” Woods files were missing from four of the 29 applications, and the other 25 applications had an average of 20 issues discovered per application.
Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following comment:
“We have been working to reform our nation’s surveillance authorities for years, and, as we predicted, this damning initial report makes clear our work is not done. The significant errors that the Inspector General uncovered in his 478 page report in December on the origins of Crossfire Hurricane do not appear to be isolated incidents. The FBI appears to have a widespread problem in failing to disclose all of the exculpatory evidence in its possession to the FISA court. The disclosure of all exculpatory information to a court is one of the most basic due process rights guaranteed to all Americans, regardless of whether the court operates in the open or behind closed doors.
“This report also comes at a critical time. In the coming months the Senate will consider extending important surveillance tools authorized in the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, which we co-authored and ushered through the Senate. At that time, we will offer an amendment to both expand amicus protections and address the issues identified by the Inspector General to ensure that agencies provide all evidence, including exculpatory evidence, to the FISA Court in their applications. The FISA process needs real reforms, not window-dressing."
"We look forward to reading the Inspector General's final report from his ongoing audit of the FISA process."

WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Sunday afternoon:
“Upon learning that my colleague Sen. Paul tested positive for COVID-19, I consulted the Attending Physician of the U.S. Congress Dr. Harding. She advised me that because I have no symptoms or other risk factors, a COVID-19 test was not warranted. However, given the timing, proximity, and duration of my exposure to Sen. Paul, she directed me to self-quarantine for 14 days. That means no traveling or voting. But I will continue to make sure Utah’s voice is heard as we shape the federal response to the Coronavirus through phone, text, email and whatever other means are available.”

Title: Sen. Lee Outlines Corona Response Priorities
Date: March 19, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday as he continued to work with Senate colleagues on an economic response to the Coronavirus.
“If there is any state that is best prepared for the one-two punch of a global pandemic and a generational earthquake, it is Utah. We will rise to this occasion. We will beat this virus. And we will rebuild from the damage from the earthquake that hit us Wednesday.”
“All of us can do our own part to help our community through these times. For some, that means staying at home, practicing responsible social distancing. For others it means being on the front lines providing medical care and tests to those affected by the virus. And for some it means cleaning up, assessing, and rebuilding our infrastructure as we recover from the earthquake.”
“Here in Washington I am working with my colleagues to make sure the federal government’s response helps all Utahns who need it. That means fighting for broad-based action to help all Americans through the social and economic disruptions this emergency is creating.
“Americans are all in this epidemic together. So the federal response – from loan guarantees to tax reforms to regulatory relief to direct aid to families – should be as inclusive as possible, rather than carved out only for select special interests.”

Require the federal government to reimburse states for the full costs of expanding the eligibility that is above and beyond each state’s current unemployment insurance law; and
Require the federal government to reimburse employers who employ fewer than 500 employees and who voluntarily provide paid leave to employees who cannot work due to coronavirus in an amount equal to the unemployment benefits described above.

Title: Lee-Leahy Introduce Bipartisan FISA Reform Bill
Date: March 9, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the “USA FREEDOM Extension and Amici Curiae Reform Act” Monday, a bill that provides federal law enforcement the tools they need to protect Americans from foreign powers while also better protecting the civil liberties of all Americans.
“Our Founding Fathers knew well the danger of a government with the power to snoop through the private communications of law-abiding Americans. They included the Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights to limit the government’s ability to spy on its citizens,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill brings much needed common sense reforms to our federal government’s foreign surveillance programs so that Americans’ civil liberties are not violated again.”
“I have been working with Senator Lee for years to rein in our nation’s surveillance authorities, which are still clearly too susceptible to abuse,” Sen. Leahy said. “Our legislation today would end the mass collection of call detail records, improve transparency and accountability, and increase privacy and civil liberties protections for all Americans. Recognizing that passing broad surveillance reform can take time we are also introducing a bill that pairs a short extension with significant reform of the amicus curiae process. We look forward to fighting for the comprehensive FISA reform Americans deserve.”
On March 15th, three provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are scheduled to expire:
The “business records” provision (50 U.S.C. §1861),
The “roving wiretaps” provision (50 U.S.C. §1805(c)(2)(B)), and
The “lone wolf” provision (50 U.S.C. §1801(b)(1)(C)).
With these authorities set to expire within a week, Sens. Leahy and Lee introduced a short three-month extension of the FISA authorities that is coupled with significant reform of the FISA amicus curiae process, the USA FREEDOM Extension and Amici Curiae Reform Act.This bill:
Ends the Call Detail Records program.
Strengthens First Amendment protections by changing the standard for surveillance under Section 215 based on First Amendment protected activities from “solely” to “substantially”.
Prohibits collection of business records without a warrant if law enforcement would require a warrant for the same search.
Requires a showing of probable cause that a known U.S. person is an agent of a foreign power or has been or will soon be involved in an act of terrorism or in clandestine intelligence activities in violation of the law for Section 215 warrants.
Excludes the following from the definition of “tangible things” under Section 215: cell site location information, global positioning system (GPS) data, internet web browsing information, internet search history and medical and health-related records.
Requires disclosure of decisions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) to include opinions that address the meaning of “specific selection term”, involve amicus curiae, or address the prohibition on obtaining authority for a search that would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant.
Requires that a court-appointed amicus have an expertise in privacy and civil liberties.
Requires the FISC to appoint an amicus curiae in cases involving a “sensitive investigative matter” defined as involving a public official, candidate, religious or political organization or staff thereof, or news media within the United States or a matter the FISC finds to be of similar sensitive nature.
Expands amicus duties from raising general privacy and civil liberties arguments to include raising “legal arguments regarding any colorable privacy or civil liberties interest of any aggrieved United States person”.
Allows amicus, once appointed, to raise any issue with the court at any time. Also, allows amicus to petition FISC to certify a question of law to the FISCR and may seek certiorari from the Supreme Court to review any FISCR decision.
Provides amicus with access to all court documents, including relevant decisions and precedents relied upon by the government.
Requires the government to turn over any “material” information “including any exculpatory information” as part of its application.
Requires the Inspector Generals of the intelligence community and DOJ to audit FISA applications from the preceding year.
Finally, the bill extends the expiring Section 215 business records provisions, the roving wiretaps provisions and the lone wolf provisions through December 2023.

Title: Conservative Lawmakers Sign Brief Supporting Religious Liberty
Date: February 11, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) and over two dozen other lawmakers signed an amicus brief Monday, supporting Our Lady of Guadalupe School and St. James Catholic School in their religious liberty cases before the Supreme Court. From the brief:
“The teaching of religious principles and customs is at the very core of faith for many, if not most, religions. Yet in the two opinions under review, the Ninth Circuit barely addressed the importance of this aspect of religion. Quite to the contrary, the court minimized the significance of ‘teaching from a book’—a striking position given that most of the world’s major religions consider the teachings found in holy books to be the very essence of their faith.”
…
“In Hosanna-Tabor, this Court unanimously held that a ministerial exception under the Religion Clauses exists. In this case, the Court should take the opportunity to hold that the exception includes those who execute the profound duty of teaching the faith to the next generation, whether they be called priest, pastor, imam, rabbi, teacher, or nothing at all. Anything less would imperil the religious pluralism of the United States.”
In Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, a Los Angeles-area Catholic school chose not to renew the contract of a teacher that a new principal believed was not successfully implementing the school’s fifth grade religion curriculum. The teacher then sued the school for age discrimination. The school then claimed that since the teacher was responsible for religious instruction, the school’s decision not to renew the teacher’s contract was protected by the First Amendment’s ministerial exception from anti-discrimination laws.
In St. James Catholic School v. Biel, a Catholic school chose not to renew the contract of a fifth grade teacher after working for months to improve her performance. Ms. Biel subsequently sued the school. Due to the teacher’s responsibility for teaching, promoting and fostering Catholic identity in her fifth-grade students, St. James Catholic school argued that their decision to not renew her contract was protected by the First Amendment’s ministerial exception from anti-discrimination laws and the district court agreed.
Amicus signatories include:
Sens. Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), James M. Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Thom Tillis (NC).
Reps. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Rick Allen (R-GA), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Brian Babin (R-TX), Robert Latta (R-OH), Doug Collins (R-GA), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Mark Meadows (R-NC), Andy Harris (R-MD), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Vicky Hartzler (R-MO), Jody Hice (R-GA), Steve King (R-IA), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Steven Palazzo (R-MS), Adrian Smith (R-NE), and Chris Stewart (R-UT.)

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act
Date: February 10, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act Monday, a bill that would codify President Trump’s 2017 executive order prohibiting the availability of foreign aid to organizations that provide or promote abortions.
“The administration’s ban on funding overseas organizations that promote abortion has already saved and will continue to save countless lives across the globe,” Sen. Lee said. “The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act would save countless more lives by making this ban on abortion promotion permanent.”
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City Policy, prohibiting the availability of family planning foreign assistance funds to organizations that provide abortions, promote or counsel for abortions, or advocate to change abortion laws in a foreign country.
Since then, the policy has been alternately rescinded and reinstated with changing administrations. President Trump reinstated this policy, renamed the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, to prohibit any foreign assistance funding from being granted to groups who perform abortions or promote abortion. The State Department also expanded this policy under Secretary Pompeo by refusing to fund foreign NGOs that give money to other foreign NGOs engaged in the international abortion industry.
This bill acknowledges the sanctity of life of all people, including the unborn in other countries, and seeks to ensure that citizens of the United States are not made complicit in abortion through taxpayer funding to non-profits and non-governmental organizations that act overseas. The United States should administer its foreign aid programs with respect for the inherent dignity of each and every human life.
Cosponsors include: Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Tom Cotton (R-AK), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Roy Blunt (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Richard Burr (R-NC), and Mike Rounds (R-SD).
Virginia Foxx (R-NC) has introduced companion legislation in the House.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday ahead of his vote to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment. From his speech:
“At the end of the day, this government does in fact stand accountable to the people. This government is of, by, and, for the people. We cannot remove the 45th President of the United States for doing something that the law and the Constitution allows him to do, without doing undue violence to that system of government to which every single one of us has sworn an oath. We’ve sworn to protect and defend that system of government. And that means standing up for the American people, and those who they have elected to do a job recognized by the Constitution. I will be voting to defend the president’s actions. I will be voting against undoing the vote taken by the American people some three and a half years ago. I will be voting for the principle of freedom. For the very principles that our constitution was designed to protect. I urge all of my colleagues to reject these deeply, factually and legally, flawed articles of impeachment… to vote not guilty.”

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Not Needing More Witnesses
Date: January 31, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after voting not to hear from witnesses at President Trump’s impeachment trial:
“We have heard from 13 witnesses via video during this trial. We have heard hours of argument. We have received hundreds of pages of legal briefs and thousands of pages of supporting documents. We know what happened: President Trump directed his staff to ask President Zelensky to issue a statement announcing an investigation into ‘Burisma and the 2016 elections.’ President Zelensky declined. Ukraine received its aid anyway, and President Zelensky met with President Trump. That’s it. That’s what happened. No new witness would change or contradict these facts. That is why I voted to move on without hearing from additional witnesses.  Like any other trial court, the Senate – here sitting as a court of impeachment – has both the authority and the obligation to decline to hold a full trial where the material facts of the case are not in dispute.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee issued the following statement Wednesday after President Trump signed the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA):
“The USMCA is a huge win for all of Utah, especially the more than 120,000 Utahns whose jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada. Utah dairy farmers, manufacturers, and the agriculture community will all benefit from continued free and fair trade with our immediate neighbors to the north and south. This update to our trade policy moves the U.S., Mexico, and Canada further into the 21st century, setting mutually beneficial standards regarding the treatment of digital services and e-commerce.”
World Trade Center Utah president and CEO Miles Hansen added:
"More than 121,000 Utah jobs depend directly on trade with Canada and Mexico. In 2018 alone, Utah companies exported nearly $2.7 billion to Canada and Mexico. With the passage of USMCA, we look forward to not only maintaining, but expanding our trade and investment ties with our closest international trade partners."
And from the Utah Manufacturers Association:
“USMCA is a win for manufacturers of all sizes—from small family businesses to large well-known manufacturing companies. The USMCA will finally provide Utah manufacturers the certainty they need to continue growing the economy and assist in creating significant jobs both in the state and across the country that depend on foreign trade. The Utah Manufacturers Association is proud to have been a part of discussions with our representatives in Congress to shape the USMCA. Utah manufacturers will greatly benefit from this agreement as will the Utah economy.”

Title: Romney and Lee Introduce Resolution Recognizing Utah’s Fight for Women’s Suffrage
Date: January 17, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a Senate resolution recognizing the leading role of Utahns in the fight for women’s suffrage and celebrating the sesquicentennial of the first votes by women under the equal suffrage law of Utah on February 14, 1870. Congressman Bishop (R-UT) introduced a companion resolution in the House of Representatives that is being cosponsored by the other members of the Utah delegation.
“Utah led the charge in the women’s suffrage movement by granting women the right to vote nearly 50 years before the rest of the country, and Utah was the first place where women cast ballots,” Senator Romney said. “With this resolution we recognize the leadership of the women’s suffrage movement in Utah and the right of every American citizen to vote.”
“Utah has a proud but largely unknown history of being a leader in the women’s suffrage movement,” Senator Lee said. “Heroes like Martha Maria Hughes Cannon, first woman elected to a state legislature, deserve to have their stories shared more widely so they can inspire future generations to reach their potential.”

Title: Reps. Cloud, Case, and Sen. Lee Request Debt Servicing Costs Estimates
Date: January 15, 2020

Content:
Today, Congressmen Michael Cloud (TX-27), Congressman Ed Case (HI-01), and Senator Mike Lee (UT-R) sent a bicameral, bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Budget Committees, asking them to require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to include debt servicing costs whenever they produce an official cost estimate.
From the letter: “Our nation’s outstanding public debt recently surpassed $23 trillion, as reported by the Treasury Department on October 31, 2019. It was only nine months ago that the U.S.’s outstanding public debt reached $22 trillion. It is the responsibility of the House and Senate Budget Committees to oversee and help rein in uncontrolled spending.
“Requiring debt servicing costs is simply a start to reducing our massive national debt, but it’s an important reform. Congress should weigh the real cost of legislation instead of ignoring costs to make new programs seem like they’re not as expensive.”
Rep. Cloud, Rep. Case, and Sen. Lee issued the following joint statement regarding the letter:
“When Congress does not understand the true cost of a proposal, it is more likely to make decisions that endanger our ability to address future needs. Including debt servicing costs in legislative cost estimates will better equip lawmakers to make informed spending decisions. Members of Congress and congressional staff would benefit from this information, which can help better inform the development of legislation and voting decisions. It’s past time Congress puts an end to reckless spending.”
Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said, “Our nation’s long-term fiscal situation is increasingly dire. Debt is rising faster than economic growth, and interest payments are the fastest-growing part of the budget. Our latest projections show that interest payments will reach over $800 billion within ten years. The federal government will spend more on interest than on children by 2021 and more on interest than on Medicaid by 2023. Given the ever-growing impact of interest costs, it is critical that they be included in budgetary estimates for legislation—and there is no reason anyone should oppose this increased level of transparency. Thank you to Senator Lee and Representatives Cloud and Case for leading an effort, along with a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers, to ask for a common sense and overdue fix to this problem.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Abortion is Not Healthcare Act
Date: January 9, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced the Abortion is Not Healthcare Act, a bill that would prevent the tax deductibility of abortions.
The IRS currently categorizes abortion as “medical care” and allows taxpayers to include abortions as qualifying out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax returns.
“The government should not offer tax benefits for a procedure that kills hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year, nor should taxpayers subsidize such a practice. This undermines the truth that all human beings have dignity and worth, and that the purpose of healthcare is to heal and care for them – not kill them,” said Sen. Lee. “Our bill would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion and clarify that this gruesome practice is not healthcare.”
Specifically, the bill would amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit abortion expenses from being considered as eligible for a medical expense deduction.
Joining Sen. Lee in support of the bill are sixteen original co-sponsors: Sens. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Rick Scott (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Steve Daines (R-MO), Ben Sasse (R-NE), David Purdue (R-GA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Pat Roberts (R-KS), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Parental Rights Bills
Date: January 8, 2020

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) recently introduced the Parental Accessibility Rights for Emergency and Negligent Treatment (PARENT) Act and the Parental Right to Know Act, a pair of bills designed to ensure that parents have access to the policies regarding the care and medical records of their children from hospitals and organizations that use taxpayer funding.
“Parents play the most important role in caring for the health of their children,” Sen. Lee said. “It is critical that they have information about the policies of the health organizations to which they bring their children for care, and that they have the ability to access their medical records. These bills would ensure that parents are afforded the right to remain informed and involved in their children’s care.”
Current law lacks transparency about parental rights regarding both the suspension of care and access to medical records from institutions that use CHIP or Medicaid funds. The result has been that some children have stopped receiving care without the consent of their parents, even resulting in death in some cases; and that parents have also been denied access to their children’s medical records in some cases.
The PARENT Act would require any hospital, clinic, or healthcare facility that receives Medicaid or CHIP funds to include information on their website and in print, upon request by the patient or parent, on the following: policies related to the provision, withdrawal, or denial of life-sustaining procedures, nutrition, or medication; policies related to parental consent of these services; and policies related to the required notification of parents and parental consent for a “do-not-resuscitate” order.
The bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO), James Lankford (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Mike Braun (R-IN).
The Parental Right to Know Act would require any hospital, clinic, or healthcare facility that receives Medicaid or CHIP funds to include the information on parental access to medical records of minors under the age of 18 on their website and in print, upon request of the patient or parent.
It is co-sponsored by Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Mike Braun (R-IN).

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Impeachment
Date: December 19, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday, responding the partisan impeachment of President Trump by the House of Representatives:
“Yesterday was a sad day for our republic. A president of the United States was impeached along partisan lines for purely partisan political reasons.”
“President Trump has done nothing wrong. All he did was ask the Ukrainian government to investigate a corrupt Ukrainian energy company. There was nothing wrong with that request. In fact, the Obama administration tried to get Ukraine to investigate the exact same energy company. The only difference is that Trump succeeded where Obama failed. Ukraine is finally investigating Burisma.”
“Unfortunately, we have known this day was coming since Tuesday, November 6, 2018–the day Democrats took control of the House. Speaker Pelosi tried to hold her colleagues off as long as she could, but the Democratic base simply hates President Trump too much, and the pressure to impeach him—for any reason at all—apparently became overpowering.”
“This day was a long time coming. It is a sad day but definitely not a surprise.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party secured a new majority in the Parliament of the United Kingdom:
“Prime Minister Johnson is due a hearty congratulations after his party’s historic win in yesterday’s parliamentary elections. I am confident he will get Brexit done for the British people.

Title: Sens. Lee, Cruz, Blackburn, and Scott Introduce Head Start Improvement Act
Date: December 5, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced the Head Start Improvement Act of 2019 Thursday, a bill that would improve the Head Start program by eliminating much of the program’s federal bureaucracy and giving the money directly to states through block grants.
“Nothing is more important to the future of our society – nor more critical to fulfilling our national commitment to equal opportunity – than the care and upbringing of the next generation,” Sen. Lee said. “Washington should respect the proven ability of communities and states to develop unique solutions for their children. Our Head Start Improvement Act is a step in that direction.”
How It Works:
Block grants the Head Start funds directly to states, territories, and federally recognized Indian Tribes
Eligible grantees receive an allotment of the Head Start funds in proportion to the number of children aged 3-5 from families with incomes below 100% of the poverty line residing within the State
Requires states to provide a 20% match to all federal funds granted
Allows states to use funding for state school choice programs
Requires all funds to be used for prekindergarten education, administration of the programs, and to provide direct technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research and training
Directs the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress comparing the different approaches used by the grant recipients

Title: Let's encourage self-sufficiency by reforming our safety net
Date: December 5, 2019

Content:
When welfare reform first inserted work requirements into our welfare system in 1996, some on the Left predicted doom for America’s most vulnerable families. New York Democratic Sen. Patrick Moynihan predicted that we would “find children sleeping on grates, picked up in the morning frozen.” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg said that we would see “children begging for money, children begging for food, 8- and 9-year-old prostitutes.” And Massachussets Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy called the bill “legislative child abuse.”
Fortunately, none of those hysterical prognostications came true. Between 1996 and 2000, single-mother welfare caseloads fell by 53%, their employment rate increased by 10 percentage points, and their poverty rate fell by 10%. And the consumption-based poverty rate among single-parent families has continued to fall since then — from 23% in 1995, to 15% in 2000, to 9% in 2010.
It goes to show that we can be compassionate and smart at the same time. Our welfare programs need to provide a hand up, not a handout. We must pair government assistance with the tools for work-capable individuals to achieve self-sufficiency.
Unfortunately, previous administrations have created loopholes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, that undermined the work requirements at the heart of welfare reform.
The number of SNAP recipients used to rise during recessions and then quickly fall as the economy recovered. But due to eligibility loopholes instituted under President Barack Obama, that didn’t happen after the most recent recession. A full ten years after the recession ended in 2009, the share of the U.S. population receiving SNAP is 40% higher now than when the recession began in 2007.
There are an estimated 1.3 million jobs currently open in our thriving economy. We, as a nation, can and should do better in moving more Americans to self-sufficiency.
To that end, the Trump administration finalized a new regulation this Wednesday designed to close one of the largest loopholes some states are using to undermine welfare reform.
Under current regulations, states can request full or partial waivers from work requirements if they can show that an area has an unemployment rate of 10% or a rate 20% higher than the national average. In 2018, five states and the District of Columbia used this loophole to avoid work requirements, and as a result, 44% of able-bodied adults without dependents lived in an area in which the work requirements were not in effect.
Work requirements have a proven record of success in moving people from welfare to self-sufficiency. In 2015, Maine began enforcing work requirements for food stamps despite partial waiver eligibility. It saw an 80% drop in its work-capable caseload in just three months. Thirteen counties in Alabama saw similar results when they implemented work requirements for food stamps in 2017.
Additionally, the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project has found that work is a critical source of social capital for struggling communities. Many individuals consider work “a source of meaning and purpose, belonging, pride, friendship, and community.”
The Trump administration has taken laudable steps to improve work in SNAP, but Congress should be doing more. That is why I will reintroduce the Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act this Congress, which will make changes to the law to strengthen work and protect the integrity of our safety net. I hope that my colleagues will join me in pursuing the goal of getting more Americans off of the sidelines and back to work.

Title: Sens. Lee, Durbin Introduce Smarter Sentencing Act
Date: November 14, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON — Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and others introduced legislation Wednesday that would modernize federal drug sentencing polices by lowering certain mandatory drug sentences.
“Our current federal sentencing laws are out of date and often counterproductive,” said Sen. Lee. “The Smarter Sentencing Act is a commonsense solution that will greatly reduce the financial and, more importantly, the human cost imposed on society by the broken status quo. The SSA will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses, while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to their families and communities.”
“Mandatory minimum penalties have played a large role in the explosion of the U.S. prison population. These mandatory minimums have too often led to sentences that are unfair, fiscally irresponsible, and a threat to public safety,” Durbin said. “The First Step Act was a critical move in the right direction, but there is much more work to be done to reform our criminal justice system. The Smarter Sentencing Act gives federal judges the authority to conduct individualized reviews to determine the appropriate sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses. I will keep fighting to get this commonsense, bipartisan legislation through the Senate with my colleague, Senator Lee.”
Lee and Durbin first introduced the Smarter Sentencing Act in 2013. Several important reforms from the Smarter Sentencing Act were included in the landmark First Step Act, which was enacted into law last year. The central remaining sentencing reform in the Lee-Durbin legislation would reduce mandatory minimum penalties for certain nonviolent drug offenses. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementation of this provision would save taxpayers approximately $3 billion over ten years.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces National Labor Relations Board Reform Bill
Date: October 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Protecting American Jobs Act Thursday, a bill that would strip the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of its power to prosecute and adjudicate labor disputes.
The NLRB, an independent federal agency consisting of five political appointees, was established to carry out the National Labor Relations Act. However, it has historically ignored traditional standards of due process, operated under lengthy and bureaucratic procedures, and caved to political pressures.
The Protecting American Jobs Act would transfer the power to hear labor disputes back to federal courts, in line with the court system established by the Constitution. The NLRB would retain the power to conduct investigations, but would not be allowed to prosecute them.
“For far too long the NLRB has acted as judge, jury, and executioner, for labor disputes in this country,” Sen. Lee said. “The havoc they have wrought by upsetting decades of established labor law has cost countless jobs. This common sense legislation would finally restore fairness and accountability to our nation’s labor laws."
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rand Paul (R-KY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).

Title: Bipartisan Letter Urges Leadership to Have Full Senate Consider ARTICLE ONE Act
Date: October 18, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of 15 senators sent a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) Thursday, requesting that the “Assuring the Robust, Thorough, and Informed, Congressional Leadership is Exercised Over National Emergencies Act” (ARTICLE ONE Act) be considered by the full Senate as soon as possible.
“The ARTICLE ONE Act’s proposition is simple but fundamental: Congress cannot continue to cede its powers to another branch, regardless of who is President or which party holds a majority,” the senators wrote in the letter. “The ARTICLE ONE Act is a small, nonpartisan step toward re-establishing the appropriate checks and balances between the Congress and the Executive that results in a federal government that is truly accountable to the people.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Krysten Sinema (D-AZ), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tom Udall (D-NM), Rob Portman (R-OH), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and Tom Carper (D-DE) all signed the letter.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act
Date: October 17, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) re-introduced the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act Thursday, a bill designed to repeal the wage subsidy law requiring all federally-funded projects worth more than $2,000 to pay workers the “prevailing wage” rate on non-federal projects in the same locality.
“The Davis Bacon Act exemplifies how big government hurts the people it purports to help, gives unfair advantages to favored special interests, and squeezes the middle class,” Sen. Lee said. “The Davis-Bacon Repeal Act would remove these government-imposed obstacles to economic opportunity facing low-skilled workers, and return wasted taxpayer dollars back into the hands of the American people.”
Joining Senator Lee in support of the “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” are six original cosponsors: Sens. Perdue (R-GA), Cruz (R-TX), Johnson (R-WI), Cornyn (R-TX), Blackburn (R-TN) and Scott (R-SC).

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Drone Integration and Zoning Act
Date: October 16, 2019

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Drone Integration and Zoning Act Wednesday, a bill to establish a regulatory framework for drones based on the principles of local governance and cooperative federalism.
“The FAA cannot feasibly or efficiently oversee millions of drones in every locality throughout the country,” Sen. Lee said. “The reason that the states have sovereign police powers to protect the property of their citizens is because issues of land use, privacy, trespass, and law enforcement make sense at the state and local level. The best way to ensure public safety and allow this innovative industry to thrive is to empower the people closest to the ground to make local decisions in real time and that is exactly what the Drone Integration and Zoning Act does.”

Title: Fighting Fake News on H-1B Reform
Date: October 2, 2019

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after Lou Dobbs falsely claimed on cable television that S. 386 “would double the size of H-1B visas.”
“I 100% agree with the White House that the H-1B program should not be used to displace or replace American workers. That is why S. 386 contains strong new anti-fraud provisions to make sure employers cannot abuse the H-1B system to undercut American workers,” Sen. Lee said.
“S. 386 is also ‘number neutral’, meaning it does not increase the number of visas, H-1B or otherwise in anyway, and under no circumstances will it become a vehicle for increasing overall immigration levels. What it does do is end the discriminatory current policy that punishes green card applicants from large countries. Our immigration system should not be in the business of discriminating against immigrants based on their country of origin and S. 386 solves that problem,” Sen. Lee finished.

Title: Sen. Lee Calls for Clarity in Antitrust Enforcement
Date: September 18, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after yesterday’s Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on antitrust.
“Yesterday’s oversight hearing illustrated the dysfunction that comes with having two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement.” Sen Lee said.
“We need robust investigations and enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially in the tech arena. That objective is likely to be hindered if the agencies are stumbling over each other trying to investigate the same companies for the same conduct,” Sen. Lee continued. “Such efforts will be wasteful and could very well undermine their ability to enforce the antitrust laws. I wouldn’t recommend that they get any additional resources until they demonstrate their willingness to put the interests of consumers above their bureaucratic gamesmanship.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Romney Comment on Emergency Funding Diversions Impacting Utah
Date: September 4, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) issued the following statements Wednesday after the Air Force informed both senators that funding appropriated by Congress for military construction projects at Hill Air Force Base would instead be spent to construct a wall on the southern border, as a result of the February 2019 emergency declaration. Lee and Romney
previously urged
the Department of Defense to protect funding for these Utah projects.
"Congress has been ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades and it is far past time for Congress to restore the proper balance of power between the three branches,” Sen. Lee said. “We should start that process by passing the ARTICLE ONE Act, which would correct the imbalances caused by the National Emergencies Act.”
“In April, Senator Lee and I expressed our significant concerns to the Secretary of Defense regarding the potential diversion of funds for critical military construction projects in Utah,” Romney said. “I’m disappointed that despite those concerns, two key military construction projects totaling $54 million will be delayed as a result of the February 2019 emergency declaration. Funding the border wall is an important priority, and the Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels in Congress, rather than divert already appropriated funding away from military construction projects and therefore undermining military readiness. Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle, and I plan to work with the delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah’s service members and our national security strategy.”
The Air Force informed Sens. Lee and Romney that $26 million was being diverted from Hill AFB Composite Aircraft Antenna Calibration Facility and another $28 million from the Utah Test and Training Range Consolidated Mission Control Center. The Administration has indicated it plans to request replacement funding for these projects in its FY2020 budget request. Congress would then have to re-appropriate the funds.
The ARTICLE ONE Act, introduced by Sen. Lee and cosponsored by Sen. Romney, would automatically end all future emergency declarations made pursuant to the NEA after 30 days unless Congress voted affirmatively to extend the emergency. Currently Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto.

Title: Sens. Lee, Klobuchar Announce Hearing on Digital Platform Mergers
Date: September 3, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, will hold a subcommittee hearing September 24th examining concerns relating to acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors by digital platforms.
“Acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors by dominant digital platforms can be pro-competitive, but they also run the risk of eliminating the very competition that may challenge the incumbent firm’s leading position in the future,” Sen. Lee said.
“We are holding this hearing to gain a better understanding of the various concerns raised by these transactions and to examine how the antitrust agencies analyze such mergers. In addition to the hearing, the Subcommittee also is interested in soliciting input from policy analysts, market participants, and other stakeholders on whether legislative action relating to such mergers is needed to ensure digital markets remain competitive,” Sen. Lee finished.
“This is an important hearing. In recent years we have seen a record number of mergers that have raised serious competition issues,” Sen. Klobuchar said. “Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world. They face little competition and there are numerous examples of the companies purchasing startup competitors in various lines of business. These companies’ practices can limit options for consumers, distort prices, and stifle innovation. With virtually no meaningful pushback from our government, these companies have reshaped the meaning of American privacy, the purchasing of goods and services, and the workings of our elections and our democracy.”
“To respond to these concerns I have continually advocated for (1) changes to our laws; (2) aggressive enforcement of the laws on the books; and (3) adequate funding for the FTC and DOJ antitrust division. I will be asking questions about the effects of tech company mergers on competition and steps to address these problems,” Klobuchar finished.
The hearing, along with the oversight hearing on September 17th with representatives from the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division, will explore issues relating to competition in technology markets and the antitrust agencies’ efforts to root out anticompetitive conduct.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on Qualcomm Antitrust Stay
Date: August 23, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a lower court antitrust ruling that would have forced Qualcomm to end certain patent licensing practices.
“Today’s decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay a district court ruling relating to the Federal Trade Commission’s case against Qualcomm highlights yet again the oddity of us having two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement,” Sen. Lee said.
“Here, we have the FTC prosecuting the case while her sister agency, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, has told the Court of Appeals that the district court ruling will harm rather than benefit competition,” Sen. Lee continued. “This kind of dysfunction and confusion illustrates why having two agencies at loggerheads does not make for effective antitrust enforcement.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Resolution Affirming INF Treaty Withdrawal
Date: August 1, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a resolution Thursday concurring with President Trump’s February 2, 2019 notice to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.
“For years now, Russia has repeatedly and routinely violated their commitments under the INF treaty,” Sen. Lee said. “For arms control to work, all parties must be committed, lawful participants. Russian non-compliance has prevailed without consequence for far too long and the United States should not remain unilaterally bound to a one-sided agreement.”
“Our withdrawal from the INF Treaty sends a clear message that we will not stand idly by while Russia works to openly violate treaties and international norms,” resolution cosponsor Sen. Enzi (R-WY) said. “I applaud the Administration’s actions and am committed to working with our NATO allies to appropriately respond to Russia’s behavior.”
“I support the withdrawal of the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Russia has designed, tested and deployed weapons in direct violation of the treaty,” resolution cosponsor Sen. Barrasso (R-WY) said. “Arms-control treaties are only effective when both parties abide by their terms in a transparent way. It is not in the United States’ interest to be the only country honoring this agreement.”
The Obama administration tried for years to raise the issue of INF non-compliance, but the Russians repeatedly refused to admit violating the treaty. After its own attempt to bring Russia back into compliance, the Trump administration announced on October 20, 2018 that the United States would withdraw from the INF treaty.
The INF Treaty’s withdrawal clause, found in Article XV of the agreement, requires six-month notice by the withdrawing party before withdrawal becomes official. This means the INF Treaty will end on August 2, 2019.
Even though the president has the Article II power to withdraw from the INF treaty on his own, Congress, per its role in treaty ratification, has an obligation to weigh in on the executive branch’s decision to withdraw the United States from a treaty.
Cosponsors: Sen. Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. Blackburn (R-TN), Sen. Braun (R-IN), Sen. Rubio (R-FL) Sen. Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Sullivan (R-AK), Sen. Graham (R-SC), Sen. Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Sen. Cramer (R-ND), Sen. Barrasso (R-WY), Sen. Johnson (R-WI), Sen. Blunt (R-MO), Sen. Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Wicker (R-MS), and Sen. Cruz (R-TX).

“Everyone now admits there is a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. But short of decriminalizing illegal immigration, Democrats don’t seem to want to do anything about it,” Sen. Lee said. “That is why this effort by Sen. Graham to reform the asylum loopholes that are driving this crisis is so important. But given the very narrow nature of this emergency legislation, and the other border security problems it does not address, it should absolutely not be paired with any measures that would make the border crisis worse by extending legal status.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act
Date: July 30, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) Act Tuesday, a bill that brings transparency, accountability, and competition to higher education.
“Too many young people today feel as though they have to choose between going into debt or not getting the education they need to get a good job. It doesn’t have to be that way,” Sen. Lee said. “The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act would not only make the cost of higher education more affordable, but would also make it easier for students to customize their own education and gain the skills they need to compete in today’s economy.”
"Education policy should be dictated at the local and state levels, and not by an out of touch bureaucracy in Washington. Many students have aptitudes and career goals that do not require and are not enhanced by college," Congressman Rooney said. "Perhaps this is why only about one-half of college students today manage to graduate within six years. Higher education should respond to the needs of our economy and today’s job market. This legislation allows states to accredit innovative non-traditional programs like online courses, apprenticeships, or vocational schools to better prepare today’s students for the modern workforce."
The bill is divided into four parts. The first title allows states to create alternative accreditation systems that can accredit any institution that provides postsecondary education programs that can be applied to a degree, credential, or professional certification. This title would also give states with alternative accreditation systems the flexibility to determine clock hour and minimum program length requirements, allowing short-term workforce development programs and nontraditional educational providers to be eligible for federal student aid. The second title requires higher education institutions participating in federal student loan programs to publish relevant outcome information in a readily accessible format, giving students access to the information they need to make informed decisions about which institutions to attend.
The third title would simplify federal student loans into one option and the fourth title would create a new financial “skin-in-the-game” requirement for universities, rewarding them for each Pell Grant graduate, but requiring them to repay a percentage of the overall amount of loans made, taking into account loan default rates and the average national unemployment rate.
The HERO Act is being sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Francis Rooney.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on DOJ’s T-Mobile/Sprint Decision
Date: July 26, 2019

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after the Department of Justice announced approval of the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.
“The Department of Justice Antitrust Division has determined that the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, subject to certain divestitures and conditions, will be pro-competitive. I’m hopeful that the transaction will better position the merged firm to compete with Verizon and AT&T in the future, particularly as these carriers seek to roll out nationwide 5G networks,” Sen. Lee said. “That said, I have concerns whenever government joins hands with industry to cobble together a would-be competitor, particularly one who so stridently opposed the merger earlier this year. Time will tell whether this market intervention was sound, but it will no doubt invite similar gamesmanship in future antitrust reviews.”

Title: Sen. Lee Responds to DOJ Review of Online Platforms
Date: July 24, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday in response to the Department of Justice’s Tuesday announcement that the Department’s Antitrust Division would begin a review of market-leading online platforms.
“The recent announcement by the Antitrust Division that it will conduct a review of competitive conditions in the online marketplace further highlights the absurdity of having two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement. Indeed, what’s evident from this latest institutional tug-of-war is that the Antitrust Division and FTC are now actively battling each other to take the lead in pursuing Big Tech,” Sen. Lee said.
“While it is laudable that our antitrust enforcers are seeking to root out potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech industry, their duplicative reviews will inevitably waste government resources and lead to the agencies taking contradictory positions on the same issues. Moreover, without clear guidance, dual enforcement will leave industry in confusion as to what to expect from regulators or even what laws will specifically apply to their operations,” Sen. Lee continued.
“In such an important area of the economy as technology, effective antitrust enforcement is critical. I look forward to exploring these issues when the Antitrust Subcommittee holds is oversight hearing on September 17,” Sen. Lee finished.

Title: Sen. Lee Locks in Vote to Pass 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund
Date: July 18, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) secured unanimous consent Thursday for the Senate to vote on two amendments and final passage of 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund next week.
“The men and women who responded to the horrific events of September 11, 2001 are among the great heroes of American history,” Sen. Lee said. “Since 2011, the 9/11 Victims Fund has always had finite authorizations, and by all accounts it has an excellent record avoiding waste and abuse. These two things are not coincidental. They go together,” Sen. Lee continued.
“That is why I would like to offer a simple amendment to this bill that would authorize $10.2 billion in additional funding for the 9/11 Victims Fund over the next 10 years. That is the amount that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated is necessary for covering all valid claims between now and 2029,” Sen. Lee said.
“Mr. President, this is something that we could vote on in a matter of minutes, fifteen minutes or so, and then move on to final passage. We could in fact accomplish all of this today, before we adjourn for the weekend. This is in fact what I would prefer. I think finishing our work on this bill to protect victims and first responders is worth a half hour of our time,” Sen. Lee continued.
Other senators did not want to vote for the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund today, so Sen. Lee agreed to schedule votes on final passage, and his amendment, next week.

“David has the judicial temperament, more than perhaps any other potential candidate, for this or any other judgeship like this and I am honored to know him and it is without reservation that I recommend him strongly for this position and look forward to voting him out of committee and on the floor to have him confirmed.”

Title: Rubio, Lee: 2018 Tax Data proves expanded Child Tax Benefited Millions of American Families
Date: July 11, 2019

Content:
Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) released statements after the Tax Foundation’s
report
on 2018 tax return data showed the positive impact the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) had for millions of American families. Their efforts
secured
a provision in the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 that doubled the CTC from $1,000 to $2,000, expanded eligibility, and increased the refundability of the CTC from $1,100 to $1,400. The data from 2018 tax returns makes it clear the benefits of this effort. The number of people who received the CTC doubled, benefiting American families in every income bracket, with the exception of top income earners.
“There is no greater job than being a parent, but the cost of raising a family in the 21st century has become an obstacle for too many working Americans,”
Rubio said
. “You cannot have a strong country without strong families. Our successful push to double and expand the child tax credit provided significant tax relief to more working moms and dads across the country, and this new data shows it. I was proud to partner with Senator Mike Lee, Ivanka Trump, and members of the pro-family coalition on this important effort.
“As I said during the tax reform process: this is only the beginning,”
Rubio added
. “We must continue our work to orient our economic policies toward stable and prosperous families, including by further expanding the child tax credit and enacting a program for paid family leave.”
“Doubling the child tax credit delivered immediate and significant tax relief to the Americans who needed it most: working moms and dads,”
Lee said
. “Twice as many parents took the credit in 2018 as did before our reforms. Families in every income bracket below the super-rich saw the value of the child credit more than double, and the greatest beneficiaries were middle class families.
“I once again commend the president, Marco Rubio, Ivanka Trump, and the rest of the coalition fighting for family tax reform. In light of this great news, Republicans should start working to increase the child credit again as soon as possible.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Romney Introduces Early Action Against Ozone Act
Date: June 25, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced the Early Action Against Ozone Act Tuesday, a bill that would allow the Environmental Protection Agency to work with local governments to lower pollution before they violate the Clean Air Act.
“Local governments that want to work with the EPA to lower pollution shouldn’t have to wait till pollution is already a problem in their communities before they are credited for reducing emissions,” Sen. Lee said. “The Early Action Against Ozone Act would empower local communities to work with the EPA before ozone levels reach unhealthy levels in their communities.”
“Ozone is a serious threat to human health. Under current law, the EPA can only work with local governments when ozone levels have already reached unhealthy levels,” Sen. Romney said. “Our bill will authorize the EPA to engage in partnerships with those local communities which are at risk of elevated ozone emissions before those unhealthy levels have been reached. Prevention is less expensive and more conducive to protecting the health of Utahns and all Americans.”
In 2002, the EPA initiated the Early Action Compact (EAC) Program to give communities at risk of violating the EPA’s ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) the option of entering into a cooperative early action agreement with EPA before they actually violated the NAAQS. This program had success: 13 out of the 14 areas that voluntarily opted into this program were successful in improving air quality and avoiding a “non-attainment” designation entirely.
Unfortunately, EPA scrapped the EAC Program in 2017 due to ligation, which argued that the program was outside EPA’s authority under the CAA. This bill would give clear authorization and direct EPA to implement a similar program to the EAC so that other areas throughout the country can have the option of taking early action to improve air quality.

Title: Sen Lee Backs President Trump's Iran Decision
Date: June 21, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday after talking with President Trump about his current Iran strategy:
“After speaking with President Trump this afternoon, I am convinced he made the right call last night. It is clear the Iranian regime is a threat, and that such threats cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking like President Obama’s reckless deal with Tehran. But neither does every provocation call for a military response.”
“Economic sanctions on Iran are working. Tehran has had to cut back support for international terrorist organizations, their criminal nuclear program, and their oil exports are plummeting. The Iranian economy has been crippled, and the Iranian people know it is their own leaders’ fault.”
“Iran’s recent provocations are a transparent attempt by a desperate regime to distract the Iranian people from the true source of their hardship. They are playing a game that has served violent autocrats for decades, at the expense of America’s interests. Changing the regime’s behavior is the right goal, but it’s not at all clear air strikes will achieve it. They may unintentionally strengthen the regime by unifying the Iranian people. President Trump is finally changing the rules of the game, and is winning.”
“If and when Iran’s provocations do demand a military response, that is a constitutional decision for the American people’s representatives in Congress. For now, the president’s Iran strategy is prudent, aggressive, and effective. I fully support it, and his decision last night.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Native Species Protection Act
Date: June 13, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Native Species Protection Act Thursday, a bill that would allow states to manage species that exist entirely within their border.
“There are real benefits to protecting endangered species from extinction, but the federal law intended to establish such protections – the Endangered Species Act – is in serious need of reform,” Sen. Lee said. “The Native Species Protection Act is a commonsense reform that would limit the damage caused by federal mismanagement of protected species and their habitats, while empowering state and local officials to pursue sensible conservation plans with their communities.”
The Native Species Protection Act clarifies that noncommercial species found entirely within the borders of a single State are not subject to regulation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 or any other provision of law enacted as an exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
Sens. Ted Cruz (R-UT) James Inhofe (R-OK), and Ron Paul (R-KY) cosponsored the bill.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Miracle Mountain Designation Act
Date: June 11, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Miracle Mountain Designation Act Monday, a bill that celebrates the survival of Elk Ridge City, Utah during the Bald Mountain Fire.
“Adversity always brings out the best in Utahns, and the tragic fires in Utah County last fall were no different,” Sen. Lee said. “I am proud to help honor the faith and hope of the Elk Ridge community by naming the peak where the fire halted ‘Miracle Mountain’.”
In September of this year, the Bald Mountain Fire burned nearly 2,000 acres of land in Utah, threatening the city of Elk Ridge, Utah. But miraculously the fire halted as it neared a local unnamed peak. Since the fire, locals have come to call that peak “Miracle Mountain”. Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) introduced a bill to rename the peak in the House last year. This Senate version of the bill is cosponsored by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).

Title: Sens. Lee and Hawley Introduce the Take Care Act
Date: June 5, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON –
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Take Care Act Wednesday
, a bill designed to promote accountability and effective administration by restoring the original understanding of the President’s constitutional power to remove his subordinates.
“For nearly 150 years after the Founding, it was well-established that Article II of the Constitution gave the President complete power to remove upper-level executive branch officers,” Sen Lee said. “But following the Supreme Court’s deeply flawed decision in Humphrey’s Executor, Congress has, since the New Deal era, gradually created an immense, headless fourth branch of government that is outside the President’s control and thus totally unaccountable to the American People. It’s time for a course correction.”
“For too long, massive federal agencies have been regulating our lives and our businesses without any democratic accountability,” Senator Hawley said. “The Take Care Act is an important step in reining in these bureaucrats by bringing them back under the control of the elected branches of our government.”
The Take Care Act would reform the administrative state by eliminating all existing restrictions on the President’s power to remove upper-level executive branch officers. Further, it limits the creation of future removal restrictions by requiring Congress to expressly establish such restrictions by statute.
The bill also eliminates certain other impediments to the President’s directive authority, such as restrictions on the White House’s review of independent agency communications. In short, the bill fully restores the original understanding of the President’s power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.
Alongside Chevron deference and open-ended delegations of legislative authority to agencies, restrictions on the removal power are among the most troubling ways in which the modern administrative state contradicts the original constitutional design. The Take Care Act thus complements other important conservative regulatory reform initiatives, such as the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, and the ARTICLE ONE Act, that Senator Lee supports.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on Antitrust Investigations
Date: June 4, 2019

Content:
Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday, responding to news stories discussing potential antitrust investigations of high-tech firms.
“Antitrust is a highly technical inquiry, not something that lends itself to easy generalizations or blanket condemnations,” Sen. Lee said. “This is why such investigations are best left to the antitrust agencies rather than Congress.”
“That said,” Sen. Lee continued, “the leaks coming from various government agencies about possible antitrust investigations only undermine the effectiveness of our nation’s antitrust laws. They also call into question why we have two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement. The substantive antitrust issues faced by tech firms share many similarities and there is a real danger that a divergence in enforcement policy between the Antitrust Division and the FTC will only result in confusion. We should be seeking more harmony in antitrust enforcement, not less.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Feinstein Introduce Due Process Guarantee Act
Date: June 3, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act Monday, a bill to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely, without charge or trial.
“Holding U.S. citizens and green card holders indefinitely, without charge or trial, is a clear violation of American values,” Feinstein said. “We made that mistake when we detained Japanese-Americans during World War II and we must never repeat it. We have a court system that is fully capable of trying and convicting terrorism suspects using existing laws. There’s simply no legitimate reason to detain Americans without due process.”
“America should never waver in vigilantly pursuing those who would commit, or plot to commit, acts of treason against our country,” Lee said. “But the federal government should not be allowed to indefinitely imprison any American on the mere accusation of treason without affording them the due process guaranteed by our Constitution. By forbidding the government from detaining Americans without trial absent explicit congressional approval, the Due Process Guarantee Act strikes the right balance between protecting our security and the civil liberties of each citizen.”
In recent years, some have argued that the indefinite detention of Americans is permissible under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Due Process Guarantee Act clarifies that the 2001 AUMF and other general authorizations cannot be construed as acts of Congress that permit indefinite detention. U.S. citizens captured on foreign soil while fighting for al Qaeda or ISIS, could still be detained.
The bill also expands the Non-Detention Act of 1971 to include green card holders in addition to citizens.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act
Date: May 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act Thursday, a bill that would empower local managers of wilderness areas to decide whether to allow and how to regulate non-motorized travel in wilderness areas.
“The National Wilderness Preservation System was created so that the American people could enjoy our country’s priceless natural areas,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill would enrich Americans’ enjoyment of the outdoors by expanding recreational opportunities in wilderness areas.”
The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibits the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, motorboats, and other forms of mechanical transport. Current Department of Interior policy considers non-motorized mountain bikes to be “mechanical transport.”
This bill would insert language to the Wilderness Act to ensure that the rules restricting “mechanical transport” do not include forms of nonmotorized travel in which the sole propulsive power is one or more persons.
Additionally, the bill would grant local officials the authority to determine whether, where, and when to allow permissible forms of nonmotorized travel over particular trails.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Government Spectrum Valuation Act
Date: May 23, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Government Spectrum Valuation Act Monday, a bill designed to estimate the value of electromagnetic spectrum assigned to each federal agency as a first step towards meeting the nations spectrum needs.
“The United States is in the midst of a ‘virtual renaissance’ that is full of opportunities for innovation that could transform the quality of life for millions of Americans.” Sen. Lee said. “The Government Spectrum Valuation Act will help us better make decisions on how to free up the radio frequency we need to make this future a reality.”
Specifically, the Government Spectrum Valuation Act would require over the next three years (and every three years thereafter) that the NTIA coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the FCC to estimate the value of electromagnetic spectrum between 3 kilohertz and 95 gigahertz for licensed or unlicensed uses that is assigned or allocated to each federal agency as well as report the value in Presidents budget and each federal agency’s statement.

Title: Senate Conservatives Ask Appropriators to Hold the Line on Life Protections
Date: May 22, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Twenty-five conservative senators sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday, asking the committee to preserve all existing pro-life and religious freedom protections in all future appropriations bills produced by the committee.
“The unborn are the most vulnerable members of our society, yet they are under attack,” the letter reads. “In 2015 alone, 638,169 unborn children lost their lives to abortion. This is a terrible tragedy, and we must continue to prevent federal funding from supporting the unjust practice of elective abortion.”
The letter also asks the Appropriations committee not to weaken any of the pro-life or religious liberty actions taken by the Trump administration. “President Trump has committed to veto any legislation that weakens current pro-life Federal policies and laws. Similarly, we remain committed to ensuring that no such legislation ever makes it to the President’s desk and will carefully review each appropriations bill to verify that they preserve pro-life and religious liberty protections that the Senate’s pro-life majority has supported for decades.”
The 25 senators who signed the letter include: Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Michael Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), James Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), Rob Portman (R-OH), James Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Michael Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

Title: Romney, Lee, Braun, Toomey Introduce Legislation to Require Congress to Budget for Natural Disasters
Date: May 21, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Pat Toomey (R-PA) today introduced the Budgeting for Disasters Act, legislation that would require future disaster funding to fall within statutory budget limits. A summary of the legislation is available
here
.
“It is long overdue for Congress to start planning ahead for natural disasters,”
Romney said
. “By building disaster spending into the annual budget process, instead of busting our spending limits and adding to our national debt, our bill will both ensure that funding is available for disaster assistance and save taxpayers billions of dollars every year.”
“The federal government should not be able to avoid difficult financial realities by simply marking funds as ‘emergency’ or ‘disaster relief,’”
Lee said
. “We’ve seen in the last 5 years that Congress would rather borrow and spend instead of cutting wasteful, unnecessary programs and saving for a rainy day. While this bill would only impact a small portion of total federal spending, it is a step in the right direction.”
“In the private sector we budget for rainy days or offset unexpected expenditures with spending cuts and the same principles should apply to Congress,”
Braun said
. “By incorporating disaster spending into the annual budget we can help Americans with disaster assistance without the process becoming a pathway for runaway spending on unrelated projects.”
"Since 2011, disaster aid packages have exceeded the statutory spending caps by a quarter of a trillion dollars,”
Toomey said
. “Since disaster aid funding has become an annual exercise, Congress and the president should be able to provide assistance while respecting budgetary rules. Setting an annual appropriation for disaster aid is a good place to start."
The Budgeting for Natural Disasters Act would:
Remove the disaster relief and wildfire suppression upward adjustments to discretionary spending caps;
Raise the threshold to waive a point of order that an emergency designation is outside the budget caps from 60 votes to 67 votes;
Require a GAO study to review the relationship between emergency, disaster, and wildfire spending, including recommendations to reform qualifications for emergency spending;
Take effect during fiscal year 2020, allowing Congress sufficient time to implement changes.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Agency Accountability Act
Date: May 14, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Agency Accountability Act Tuesday, a bill designed to increase transparency, oversight, and accountability over the executive branch.
“Congress has given far too much power and authority to the executive branch and it is far past time for us to start taking it back,” Sen. Lee said. “By forcing government agencies to get approval from Congress before spending government money, the Agency Accountability Act is an essential element of any effort to rein in executive branch overreach.”
Specifically, the Agency Accountability Act would direct any agency that receives a fee, fine, penalty, or settlement to deposit that money into the general fund of the Treasury. Exceptions are made for the Postal Service, Patent and Trademark Office, as well as loan guarantee and insurance programs.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Aviation Empowerment Act
Date: May 10, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Aviation Empowerment Act Thursday, a measure intended to address the outdated rules and regulations of the FAA which stifle innovation within the general aviation sector.
“Innovation is key to competition and accessibility,” Sen. Lee said. “The growing record of aviation cost-sharing services in other countries shows they can be safe and effective. It is past time we enable such services in our country."
Specifically, the Aviation Empowerment Act reverses the FAA’s ban on online flight-sharing platforms by allowing a pilot who wants to share flight expenses to communicate with the public regarding an aircraft flight in any manner the pilot determines appropriate. It would also modify the prohibition on private pilot compensation by creating a new “personal operator” category, which would allow a pilot who has a private pilot certificate to: 1) receive compensation for flying persons or property and 2) not be subject to certain commercial airliner operation regulations as long as that private pilot only flies an aircraft with 8 or fewer seats.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act
Date: May 6, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Air Traffic Control Safe Operations and Readiness Act Monday, a bill designed to decrease the number of applicants that flunk out of the air traffic control academy.
“When employers look to hire a new employee, common sense suggests they should look for qualified candidates with job-relevant experience,” Sen. Lee said. “Currently federal law forbids the FAA from doing this for half of their air traffic controller hire. This is ridiculous. We need to let the FAA hire experienced candidates that have the best skills to keep us safe.”
The ATC SOAR Act would restore common sense hiring to the FAA by eliminating the requirement that approximately 50% of open controller positions go to “off the street” applicants and would instruct the FAA to give preference to veterans, national guard members, and candidates with previous controller experience or training.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Military Humanitarian Operations Act
Date: May 6, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced Military Humanitarian Operations Act Monday, a bill designed to ensure that presidents cannot use humanitarian crises as a loophole around the War Power Act.
“The Founders placed the power to declare war squarely in the legislative branch so that it would reside in the body most accountable to the people,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately, some presidents have used humanitarian crises as a justification for the unilateral use of military force. For example, in 2011 the executive branch cited the prevention of “an imminent humanitarian catastrophe” as a central tenant for unilateral authorization of engagement in Libya, a mission that well-exceeded the 60- day limit set by the War Powers Act. We need to close this separation of powers loophole.”
The Military Humanitarian Operations Act would require the president to secure congressional authorization before deploying U.S. armed forces for a military humanitarian operation. Military rescue missions of U.S. citizens (including military and diplomatic personnel) abroad, humanitarian missions in response to natural disasters where no combat hostilities are reasonably anticipated, and armed forces training exercises are exempted.

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces Global Trade Accountability Act
Date: May 2, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Global Trade Accountability Act Thursday, a bill that would subject unilateral actions by the president to increase trade barriers to congressional approval.
“Congress has ceded far too much law making power to the Executive branch including the power to unilaterally raise tariffs,” Lee said. “Sudden hikes in trade barriers could wreak havoc on many small and midsize manufacturers in my home state of Utah that rely on imports and globally connected supply chains. Congress must be involved in any decision that would increase barriers to trade.”
The Global Trade Accountability Act would require both chambers of Congress to affirmatively approve of any “unilateral trade actions” by the president before they could take effect. The bill would only cover unilateral trade actions by the President to increase trade barriers. “Unilateral trade actions” in this legislation are defined as any increases in tariffs or duties, tightening of tariff-rate quotas or quantitative restrictions on imports, and other restrictions or prohibitions on imports.

Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Senator Sanders, Senator Paul, Congressman Ro Khanna, and others on a letter asking President Trump to sign a resolution pursuant to the War Powers Act calling for the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen after the House passed it earlier on Thursday.
“The Founders placed the power to declare war squarely in the legislative branch so that it would reside in the body most accountable to the people. With passage of this resolution, we have reasserted Congress’s constitutional role over declaring war and over putting American blood and treasure on the line. It is long past time that we end U.S. involvement in this unauthorized, unjustified, and immoral war that has caused immense human suffering. Today’s vote in the House sends this resolution to the president’s desk, and I encourage President Trump to sign this legislation.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Working Families Flexibility Act
Date: April 4, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee reintroduced the Working Families Flexibility Act Thursday, a bill that would give employees more flexibility on how to use their overtime benefits.
“For many families, especially those with young children, their most precious commodity is time,” said Sen. Lee. “But today, federal labor laws restrict the way moms and dads and everyone else can use their time. For decades, Congress has given a special exemption from these laws to government employees. This is unacceptable. The same work-life options available to government employees should be available to private-sector workers, as well.”
In 1978, Congress passed the “Federal Employee Flexible and Compressed Work Schedule Act” providing Federal, State, and local governments the ability to give their employees a choice between overtime pay or paid time off for working overtime hours. This legal disparity unfairly discriminates against private-sector employees and impedes those employers who want to offer their employees this flexibility to balance work and family obligations.
The Working Families Flexibility Act fixes this disparity by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide employers with the necessary flexibility to allow their employees to choose either the traditional overtime pay or paid time off for any overtime hours worked.

“NATO and other mutual defense agreements have a purpose,” Sen. Lee said, “but the United States cannot and should not bear the greatest brunt of the financial burden in global alliances and defense partnerships. The information included in this report would be instrumental in informing Congress’ oversight of our own military and defense spending and would help educate lawmakers on the return on investment we receive in exchange for our contributions and commitments. For security alliances and partnerships to be most effective, all parties must pull their weight.”
The report would be submitted annually to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Title: Sens. Lee And Paul Introduce The Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act
Date: March 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act Thursday, a bill that give would give farmers and ranchers the freedom not to participate in Department of Agriculture check-off programs.
“If farmers and ranchers want to get together and pool their resources to better promote their products, then that is the free market at its best,” Lee said. “But as soon as the power of the federal government is used to force people into a program they do not want to participate in, then that is crony capitalism at its worst.”
Check-off programs are funded through compulsory fees on producers of milk, eggs, beef, and a multitude of other agricultural products. The programs and associated boards regularly receive criticism for their lack of transparency, apparent conflicts of interest, misuse of their power, anticompetitive behavior, and other related issues.
The Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act would allow farmers and ranchers to participate in check-off programs if they desire to while ending the tax on those producers who would prefer not to participate in these programs.

Title: Sens. Lee, Booker Introduce Commodity Check Off Reform Bill
Date: March 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2019 (OFF Act) Thursday, a measure intended to bring much needed transparency and accountability to the federal government’s commodity check off programs.
Checkoff programs are mandatory participation programs under the US Department of Agriculture. These programs are funded through compulsory fees on producers of eggs, beef, pork and a multitude of other agricultural products. The programs and associated boards have received criticism in the past for a lack of transparency, apparent conflicts of interest, misuse of their funding and anticompetitive behavior.
“Checkoff programs force farmers to pay into a system that sometimes actively works against their interests," said U.S. Senator Mike Lee. "On top of that, the boards for these programs have come under fire for a lack of transparency and for misuse of their funds. The Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act is common sense reform that would help farmers see exactly where the fees they pay are going and ensure that their hard-earned money is not being used against them.”
"Federal checkoff programs need to start working again for the family farmers and ranchers who are required to pay into them,” said U.S. Senator Cory Booker. “This bipartisan legislation will bring much needed reforms by prohibiting conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices, and requiring more transparency in these programs.”
This bill is a direct response to the egg board scandal and past checkoff program misconduct, and the changes proposed by this legislation are designed to improve checkoff board behavior and avoid similar conduct in the future.
To improve the practices of checkoff programs, the Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2019 would:
Clarify and fortify the prohibition on checkoff programs from contracting with organizations that lobby on agricultural policy
Establishes program standards that prohibit anticompetitive behavior and engaging in activities that may involve a conflict of interest
Requires transparency through publication of checkoff program budgets and expenditures, and means for audits of compliance

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) made the following statement Thursday after the White House communicated it would not support the ARTICLE ONE Act, a bill that would reclaim legislative powers for Congress from the executive branch.
“Congress is supposed to be the first among the federal government’s three co-equal branches,” Sen. Lee said. “For decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch. While there was attention on the issue I had hoped the ARTICLE ONE Act could begin to take that power back. Unfortunately, it appears the bill does not have an immediate path forward, so I will be voting to terminate the latest emergency declaration. I hope this legislation will serve as a starting point for future work on this very important issue.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces ARTICLE ONE Act to Reclaim Congressional Power
Date: March 12, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the ARTICLE ONE Act today, a bill that would take back significant legislative powers given to the executive branch by the National Emergencies Act of 1976.
Specifically, the bill would automatically end all future emergency declarations made pursuant to the NEA after 30 days unless Congress voted affirmatively to extend the emergency. Currently Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto.
“If Congress is troubled by recent emergency declarations made pursuant to the National Emergencies Act, they only have themselves to blame,” Sen. Lee said. “Congress gave these legislative powers away in 1976 and it is far past time that we as an institution took them back. If we don’t want our president acting like a king we need to start taking back the legislative powers that allow him to do so. The ARTICLE ONE Act will go a long way to restoring the balance of powers in our republic.”

Title: Sens. Ernst, Lee Put Forward Paid Parental Leave Plan That is Budget Neutral and Flexible for Parents
Date: March 12, 2019

Ernst, Lee Put Forward Paid Parental Leave Plan That is Budget Neutral and Flexible for Parents
The plan would enable parents to stay home with their newborns without creating a massive mandated government program
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are putting forward a paid parental leave plan that is budget neutral and flexible for parents who choose to opt in.
Their legislation, the CRADLE Act, would allow parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid leave by giving them the option to postpone activating their Social Security benefits. The plan provides every new mom and dad the flexibility to stay home with their newborns during the critical first months after birth, without creating another massive mandated government program or adding to our ever-growing deficit.
“It’s past time we modernize our family leave policies to reflect the evolving needs of today’s workforce and to reduce the barriers that pose challenges for parents balancing family and work. Millions of working moms and dads in Iowa, and across the country, face huge hurdles in taking time off to spend with their newborns. As a mother, I understand how important it is for children to bond with their parents in the first precious few weeks after birth,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Our proposal is a path forward for a budget neutral paid leave option that gives parents greater flexibility without imposing a new government entitlement or mandate.”
“Families are the bedrock of our society. If young people can’t afford to marry and start a family then the American dream literally has no future,” Senator Mike Lee said. “We need to make sure our existing social insurance programs are doing all they can to work for working families. The CRADLE Act will give working families the flexibility they need to make sure Social Security is working for them.”
Background:
The CRADLE Act would allow both natural and adoptive parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid leave benefits by giving them the option to delay activating their Social Security benefits for two, four or six months. Expectant parents would simply fill out a form to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) of their intention to take paid leave before an expected birth or adoption. Then, after the birth or adoption, the SSA would begin payments two weeks after parents applied for their baby’s social security number.
To be eligible, parents must meet certain work requirements, and benefit levels would be determined by using the same formula used for determining Social Security Disability benefits. The formula is progressive, meaning that monthly benefits would be more generous to those least likely to have the luxury of an employer-sponsored benefit.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Open America’s Water Act of 2019
Date: March 7, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Open America’s Water Act of 2019 Thursday, a bill which would repeal the Jones Act and allow all qualified vessels to engage in domestic trade between U.S. ports.
“Restricting trade between U.S. ports is a huge loss for American consumers and producers. It is long past time to repeal the Jones Act entirely so that Alaskans, Hawaiians, and Puerto Ricans aren’t forced to pay higher prices for imported goods—and so they rapidly receive the help they need in the wake of natural disasters.”
In 1920, Congress passed the Merchant Marine Act (more widely known as the Jones Act), which requires all goods transported by water between U.S. ports to be carried on a vessel constructed in the U.S., registered in the U.S., owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed primarily by U.S. citizens.
The Cato Institute estimates that after accounting for the inflated costs of transportation and infrastructure, the forgone wages and output, the lost domestic and foreign business revenue, and the monetized environmental toll the annual cost of the Jones Act is in the tens of billions of dollars. And that figure doesn’t even include the annual administration and oversight costs of the law.

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley, Murkowski, Blackburn, and Rubio Introduce Inspector General Access Act
Date: March 6, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Inspector General Access Act of 2019 today, a bill that would expand the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General to include alleged DOJ attorney misconduct.
“Our federal government inspectors general do a valuable job providing the information voters and lawmakers need to hold federal government agencies accountable,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately, the Department of Justice OIG currently does not have the power to review the conduct of DOJ attorneys, an oversight which this legislation corrects.”
“Federal prosecutors wield tremendous authority to enforce our laws. Any abuse of that authority should be thoroughly and independently investigated to uphold the public trust. Leaving those investigations to other Department attorneys opens the door to real or perceived conflicts of interest, which must be avoided. The Inspector General Access Act ensures that allegations of misconduct by DOJ lawyers are reviewed by independent department watchdogs instead of other DOJ attorneys,” Grassley said.
“The American people rightly expect that all government employees, including federal prosecutors, are held to the highest ethical and professional standards,” said Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) “To that end, our nation’s inspectors general provide an important public service by making sure Congress has all the information it needs to hold agencies accountable. It simply doesn’t make sense that current law excludes the conduct of DOJ attorneys from the same level of accountability.”
“Inspectors General play an integral role in independently evaluating and investigating alleged instances of waste, fraud, and abuse across federal government agencies and programs, including allegations of employee misconduct,” Rubio said. “However, current law does not allow the DOJ Inspector General to review the conduct of DOJ attorneys. This bill rectifies that by providing the DOJ Inspector General with the appropriate authority to independently and transparently evaluate allegations of misconduct by DOJ attorneys.”
The Inspector General Access Act solves the problems that have long plagued oversight of DOJ lawyers by simply striking the jurisdictional carve out in § 8E of the Inspector General Act. As a result, DOJ’s Inspector General would be fully empowered to investigate allegations of professional misconduct against department lawyers. In addition to enhancing oversight and public accountability at DOJ, this simple, common sense reform will bring DOJ in line with the practices in other federal agencies where allegations of attorney professional misconduct are already subject to investigation by Inspectors General.

“My initial assessment is that what President Trump announced is legal,” Sen. Lee said. “Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday after the House of Representatives passed a resolution pursuant to the War Powers Act calling for the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen.
“The Founders specifically gave Congress – the branch closest to the people – the power to declare war,” Sen. Lee said. Yet we’ve been participating in the Yemeni Civil War since 2015 without any approval from Congress. It was unconstitutional then, and it’s unconstitutional now. Today the House took us one step closer to restoring Congress’s war powers, and I look forward to consideration here in the Senate.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act
Date: February 7, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards.
“Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas."
“Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.”
The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently.
The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ).

Title: Senate Passes Resolution Renaming VA Outstation After Major Brent Taylor
Date: February 5, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – The United States Senate agreed unanimously to rename the North Ogden Department of Veteran’s Affairs Outstation the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation Tuesday. Major Brent Taylor was the Mayor of North Ogden when he made the ultimate sacrifice on November 3, 2018 while deployed in Afghanistan. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) has introduced companion legislation in the House.
“In every aspect of his life, Major Taylor was a shining example of patriotism, sacrifice, and service,” Sen. Lee said on the floor of the United States Senate while securing unanimous consent for the resolution’s passage. “It is only right that we honor his extraordinary life. And to that end, it would only be a fitting tribute to rename the Ogden veterans’ center as the ‘Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation.’ ”
From the floor of the U.S. House, Bishop said, “Brent Taylor lived an exemplary life. My heart will forever break for the loss of such a giant, but I will take comfort knowing that example he set in life, will long endure.” Bishop added, “The naming of a building will never repay the debt our nation owes Mayor Taylor or his family, but it can stand as a humble reminder of the citizen soldier who lost his life in the service of others.”
“Major Taylor represented the very best of Utah and our nation, and we are heartbroken by his loss. Renaming the Ogden veterans’ center in his honor will serve as an enduring reminder of a patriot, loving family man, and beloved community leader who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation,” said Sen. Romney.
Mrs. Jennie Taylor, the widow of Major Taylor, was in Washington as a guest of Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) for the State of the Union when the resolution passed.

Title: Sen. Lee Celebrates 1000th Mobile Office Visit
Date: February 1, 2019

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) will join his staff at Taylorsville City Hall today, to celebrate the 1000th Mobile Office visit made available to the people of Utah.
“I want my office to be open and available to all Utahns as often as possible,” Sen. Lee said. “The best way to achieve that is by going directly to them. Utahns deal with a range of federal issues – from Social Security to veterans benefits to navigating the bureaucracy of the federal government – and I want my staff to be there to help them get answers.”
Sen. Lee's Mobile Office visits are a resource for constituents across Utah who might not otherwise be able to meet with casework officers or other staff at Sen. Lee’s permanent offices in Salt Lake City, Ogden, and St. George. These office hours provide Utahns with an opportunity to speak with members of Sen. Lee’s staff face-to-face about specific constituent service needs or more general federal government issues – and to do so in the convenience of their own community.
Since 2011, Sen. Lee’s staff has met with over 12,000 Utahns at over 1,000 Mobile Office visits throughout Utah’s 29 counties. We’ve been from Snowville to Montezuma Creek, from Wendover to Ballard, and all over the Wasatch Front to every corner of Utah. Over 100 of these visits were targeted senior assistance visits to senior centers and retirement communities.
What:
Mobile Office Visit to Taylorsville
When:

Title: Sen. Lee Reintroduces “CBO Show Your Work” Bill
Date: January 31, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the “CBO Show Your Work” Act Wednesday, legislation designed to improve the legislative process by making the Congressional Budget Office more transparent and accountable.
“Congress does need a scorekeeper to provide budgetary estimates for the policy changes it considers,” Sen. Lee said. “But at a bare minimum, that scorekeeper should be forced to show how its models work. Currently the CBO doesn’t have to do that.”
“That is why I have reintroduced the CBO Show Your Work Act of 2019,” Lee continued. “This bill would require the CBO to publish its data, models, and all details of computation used in its cost analysis and scoring. CBO would keep its role as official scorekeeper of congressional budget proposals – but now the American people and the economic community would be able to see what’s going on in all those spreadsheets and algorithms.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Federal Courts Access Act
Date: January 31, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after introducing the Federal Courts Access Act of 2019, Thursday.
“For too long, trial lawyers have been able to manipulate the diversity jurisdiction rules to deny litigants their day in federal court,” Sen. Lee said. “By creating a minimal diversity requirement consistent with the vision of the very first Congress, this bill increases out-of-state litigants' access to the federal courts for major controversies. By returning to first principles, we can increase both fairness and efficiency in the civil litigation system.”
The framers of the Constitution were well aware of the dangers state court bias posed to national commerce. That is why from the beginning they created “diversity” jurisdiction, thus allowing litigants from out of state access to federal courts.
But thanks to an 1806 Supreme Court case, plaintiffs now only need to identify one in-state defendant to defeat diversity jurisdiction. This bill fixes that problem by allowing access to federal court for any case where at least one defendant is from out of state.

Title: Sen. Lee Honored to Meet First Step Act Beneficiary Matthew Charles
Date: January 28, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after meeting Matthew Charles, the first prisoner released due to passage of the First Step Act:
“It was truly an honor to meet Matthew Charles today,” Sen. Lee said. “Here is a man who served his debt to society, turned his life around, and is already contributing to his family and community. There is still more we can do to make sure our criminal justice system is as fair and humane as possible, and success stories like Mr. Charles will make further reform possible.”
“There is more reform that is needed,” Mr. Charles said during the half hour meeting. “This is a starting point but it is a good starting point. It is going to shift the atmosphere of federal prisons just by the First Step Act being passed.”
Matthew Charles was sentenced to 35 years for selling 216 grams of crack in 1996. While in prison he completed 30 Bible correspondence courses, taught GED classes, and helped fellow inmates with their cases. He was released in 2016 after a judge determined he qualified for a sentence reduction under the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act.
Since being released, Mr. Charles has been a model member of the community, finding an apartment to live in and continuing to volunteer at the food pantry he was assigned for parole even after he didn’t have to. He reconnected with his daughter and grandkids and spent Christmas with them.
But federal prosecutors appealed his release, eventually succeeding in putting Mr. Charles back in prison.
In 2018, Charles was again released by a federal judge citing The First Step Act provisions to eliminating the crack vs. cocaine sentencing discrepancy.

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on End of Government Shutdown

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after President Trump announced the end of the government shutdown:
“It is of course a relief that the shutdown is over. But the shutdown was not created by the crisis on the border. It was created by the failure of Congress to do its job. The way we are doing things now is convenient for politicians, but not for the American people. Government funding and immigration policy shouldn’t be a secret negotiation, but an open debate on the floors of the House and Senate. That’s the only way the American people can be included in this process.”

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Ending Shutdown and Paying Federal Workers

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday after voting against a White House plan to fund the federal government:
“If this had been a vote to begin debate on a deal to end the shutdown, I would have happily voted yes,” Sen. Lee said. “But this was a vote to end debate on a bill that I believe is fundamentally flawed. In fact, after specifically asking for assurances that we would be allowed to offer amendments, no assurances were given. This bill as is simply does not do enough to reform our immigration system or address the crisis at our southern border.”
“I do believe, however, that our federal workforce should not suffer while this dispute continues. That is why I am co-sponsoring Sen. Ron Johnson’s (R-WI) Shutdown Fairness Act, a bill that would ensure essential federal workers are paid during government shutdowns.”
Sen. Lee also still supports the End Government Shutdowns Act, a bill that would end government shutdowns by creating an automatic continuing resolution for any regular appropriations bill not completed before existing spending authority runs out.

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley Reintroduce Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: January 24, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) reintroduced an amendment to the United States Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year. This amendment would put a stop to the current “status quo” of Congress spending far more money than the federal government takes in and would place strict limitations on the federal government’s ability to increase taxes, raise the debt limit, and carry out other actions that threaten our long-term fiscal sustainability.
“For far too long, hardworking Americans have been forced to bear the burden of Congress’ inability and unwillingness to control federal overspending,” Lee said. “As our federal debt continues to rise at an alarming rate, the least we can do is require the federal government to not spend more money than it has at its disposal. We expect families, businesses, and state and local governments all to stick to their budgets and live within their means – there is no reason that the federal government should not have to follow the same set of rules.”
“It’s simple math: The federal government should not be spending more taxpayer money than it brings in. Families, farmers and businesses across my home state of Iowa and across the entire country make difficult decisions every day to balance the books. It’s the responsible thing to do. Almost every state has adopted some form of a balanced budget requirement, and it’s past time that the federal government follows suit,” Grassley said.
The proposed amendment, S.J. Res. 5, would require Congress to spend no more than it collects during any fiscal year, and limits spending to 18% of the gross national product, the 40-year historical average of total federal receipts. Congress can only run a deficit, raise taxes, or increase the debt limit if agreed to by two-thirds of both the House and Senate. Furthermore, the amendment gives standing to any member of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the balanced budget requirement as long as they have been authorized to do so by a petition signed by one-third of either the House or the Senate.
Congress ought to waste no time in passing this amendment to take a positive, affirmative step towards fiscal responsibility.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Bill to Make Mexico City Policy Permanent
Date: January 22, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced legislation Friday that would make the administration’s “Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance” policy, formerly known as the Mexico City Policy, permanent statutory policy.
“The administration’s ban on funding overseas organizations that promote abortion has already saved and will continue to save countless lives across the globe,” Lee said. “We cannot leave the fate of these regulations up to the whims of successive presidents. Congress must now step up and do what they can to turn the ‘Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance’ executive order into law.”
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan established the ‘‘Mexico City Policy,’’ which prohibits foreign aid for family planning purposes from being given to foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortion as an option for family planning, regardless of the source of funding. When applied, this prohibits any foreign private or nonprofit entity from receiving US family planning foreign assistance that provides or promotes abortion.
President Clinton and President Obama overturned the policy in 1993 and 2009, respectively. Apparently, they supported U.S. taxpayer dollars being used to end new life or to promote abortion.
The Department of State restored President Reagan’s policy in May of 2017 and renamed it “Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.” As part of this modernization, the policy was expanded to cover all Federal aid, not just family planning assistance.

Title: Sen. Lee Delivers Remarks on March for Life
Date: January 16, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today spoke on the Senate floor regarding the 46th annual March for Life, to be held in Washington, D.C. this Friday.
“The story of American history is the story of our nation overcoming oppression, protecting the vulnerable in our laws and with our lives. From Independence Hall to the Bill of Rights, from the abolition of slavery to universal suffrage to the Civil Rights movement, to the triumph over Nazism, fascism, and communism… the American people have fought through prejudice and pride to assert and to defend the equal dignity of every member of our human family.
For all the powerful forces still arrayed against it, the right to life remains a part of who we are – a common heritage and, history will prove, a common destiny. That is why the March grows every year. Not only here in Washington, but in solidarity marches in state capitals around the country.
….
The struggle for life is just the latest battle in America’s long, noble crusade for justice, equality, freedom, and dignity. It is a fight worth having, a fight worthy of our heritage, a fight worthy of our children. One day soon, Mr. President: we’re going to win this one too. And until that day, America will continue to march.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Romney Introduce the Protect Utah's Rural Economy Act
Date: January 10, 2019

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) reintroduced the Protect Utah’s Rural Economy (PURE) Act. The bill would protect Utah from presidential Antiquities Act abuse in much the same way Alaska and Wyoming are currently protected.
“Rural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified decent-paying job, a family to love and support, and a healthy community whose future is determined by local residents – not their self-styled betters thousands of miles away,” Sen. Lee said. “That is why I am reintroducing the Protecting Utah’s Rural Economy Act today, a bill that would protect Utah from future abuses under the Antiquities Act. The PURE Act would give Utah’s rural communities a real voice in local land management policies, a voice they currently do not have today, by prohibiting the president from establishing or expanding a national monument in Utah unless the proposed monument has been authorized by an act of Congress and the state legislature.”
“For too long, Washington bureaucrats have dictated to our counties, ranchers, and recreators how and if they can use their lands,” said Senator Romney. “The PURE Act returns the decision-making and management power of our public lands to those closest to the land. I’m proud to sponsor legislation that puts an end to excessive landgrabs and provides rural Utahns a voice in land management.”
Passed in 1906, the Antiquities Act was originally intended to protect objects of historic and cultural interest like artifacts and religious sites. Unfortunately, what was once a narrowly targeted tool for preventing looting on federal lands has become a tool distant elites use against rural Americans. Two states, Alaska and Wyoming, currently enjoy protections from future Antiquities Act designations after millions of acres were restricted in those states.

“We already have 650 miles of wall on the southern border. But it is not enough. President Clinton built wall, President Bush built wall, and even President Obama built wall. Walls work. Let’s come together, give the Department of Homeland Security the money they need to address this crisis, and end the shutdown.”

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on Public Lands Bill
Date: December 21, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Friday regarding a public lands package that failed to pass the Senate Wednesday night:
“I understand people’s frustration, and I share it. Governor Herbert, like 49 other governors, has been completely cut out of this broken, unfair process. He has no choice but to accept the process and simply hope to get what he can out of it.
“Chairman Bishop hates the process too, but he is up against the clock, with Democrats about to take over the House. If I were in their shoes, I might be saying exactly what they are saying.
“But I’m not. I’m not just in the Senate; I’m on the committee, which is driving this process. I understand people want me to let the bad process slide this once so we get it done. But that is exactly how the broken process – the process that excludes Utah, that cuts Utah out, and leaves Utah behind – perpetuates itself.
“I’m the one person in a position to stand up for my state and shine a light on this broken process. That’s the only way it’s ever going to get better. I understand this bill will probably pass now in a few weeks, but it will do so without my vote.
“Governor Herbert and Chairman Bishop are good friends, good men, and excellent public servants. I respect their position and empathize with it. But my job is different from their jobs. And as long as the Senate tries to foist these lands bills on western states at the last minute, hiding the bill as long as possible to avoid transparency and accountability, I will fight it in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and on the Senate floor.

Title: Sen. Lee Applauds U.S.-Mexico Asylum Agreement
Date: December 21, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON—Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today responding to Thursday’s Department of Homeland Security announcement that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement that will help solve the migrant crisis:
“I applaud Secretary Nielsen’s announcement yesterday of the Migration Protection Protocol. For too long our asylum system has been overloaded and subject to serious abuse. The Administration’s new policy is a strong first step toward solving these problems and putting the system on a more sustainable footing,” Lee said.
“The new protocol also shows what close cooperation with Mexico on migrant issues - something I have been strongly encouraging on both sides of the border - can accomplish. Going forward, my hope is that Congress follows the Administration’s example and enacts permanent changes to our asylum system,” Lee continued.
“I firmly believe both in the rule of law and that America should provide sanctuary for legitimate asylum seekers who suffer persecution in their home countries. The MPP advances both of these objectives, and is a great first step toward much needed reform of our asylum system.”
Sen. Lee visited Mexico twice in the last two months. You can read more about his trips

Title: Sen. Lee Releases Statement on Passage of S.J.R. 54
Date: December 13, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement today after the Senate passed S.J.R. 54, a resolution leveraging their War Powers authority to end U.S. involvement in Yemen.
“Today was a victory for the Constitution and the separation of powers,” Sen. Lee said. “With this vote, we are one step closer to reviving our constitutional framework - where the power to declare war lies with Congress, not the executive branch - and we have taken a step towards removing ourselves from the spread of human suffering in Yemen.”
The resolution, cosponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) was originally tabled in March of this year. However, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Senate resurrected the bill and brought it to the floor. Sen. Lee has spoken out numerous times on the importance of this resolution, including last evening on the Senate floor.

Title: Senate Calls on State Department to Continue Search for Missing Utahn
Date: November 30, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) secured unanimous consent Thursday for passage of a Senate resolution calling on the State Department to continue its investigation into the likelihood that Utahn David Sneddon was abducted by the current totalitarian North Korean regime.
“At the time of his disappearance, David had his whole life ahead of him. He was eager to get back to BYU’s beautiful campus and had recently signed up to take the LSAT. But he never had the chance to do any of these things, and the Sneddon family deserves to know why,” Lee said.
“The first and most important responsibility of the United States government is to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people at home and abroad,” Lee continued. “The State Department’s responsibilities in this matter include investigating all plausible explanations behind David’s disappearance, and leaving no stone unturned in trying to return one of our brothers to his family.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Hatch Introduce Bill Renaming VA Outstation After Major Brent Taylor
Date: November 29, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced a Senate resolution renaming the North Ogden Department of Veteran’s Affairs outstation the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation. A companion bill was introduced on Tuesday, November 20th, 2018 by Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) and was cosponsored by Reps. Chris Stewart (R-UT), John Curtis (R-UT) and Mia Love (R-UT). The bill would rename the outstation after Major Brent Taylor, who made the ultimate sacrifice on November 3rd, 2018 while deployed to Afghanistan. Prior to that deployment, he served as Mayor of North Ogden, where the outstation is located.
“Major Brent Taylor’s life may be best defined by the word ‘service.’” Sen. Lee said. “When he said ‘service is what leadership is all about,’ he knew that from personal experience, and he exemplified that motto in all aspects of his life. Bestowing his name on an outpost that aids his fellow servicemen and women in the town that he loved and served is a poignant way to honor his legacy of service, leadership, and Christ-like love. I am honored to join with my fellow Utah delegation members to bring this bill to the floor.”
“Brent Taylor was a hero, a patriot, a loving father, and a dear friend,” Sen. Hatch said. “News of his death in Afghanistan was devastating to all Utahns. Renaming this facility after Brent is a fitting tribute to his leadership, courage, and integrity. I hope it will also show Jennie and the Taylor family how much we honor their sacrifice.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Markey Introduce Spectrum Valuation Act
Date: November 14, 2018

Content:
Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Government Spectrum Valuation Act. The bill would require the annual coordination of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to determine the value of electromagnetic spectrum assigned or allocated to each federal agency. It would also require each federal agency to report the value of their electromagnetic spectrum in the President’s budget and each federal agency’s financial statement.
“Congress has a clear responsibility to ensure that federal spectrum is being managed effectively and appropriately,” Sen. Lee said. “One of the first steps to conducting effective oversight is assessing the value of federal spectrum allocations. By simply calculating the value of federal spectrum allocations, Congress and the Administration will be better equipped to identify valuable federal spectrum bands and manage each federal spectrum allocation more efficiently.”
“Spectrum is the oxygen of the wireless world,” Sen. Markey said, “ensuring American consumers and companies enjoy all of the benefits of this Internet of Things economy. It’s a simple formula: more available spectrum equals more competition and innovation. But you cannot effectively manage what you have not measured, and this legislation will finally ensure the public knows the value of spectrum held by the federal government so we can ensure it is being put to the best use.”

Title: ICYMI: As Caravan Nears, Grassley, Lee Call on State, DHS to Explore Asylum Agreement with Mexico
Date: October 24, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) called on the Trump Administration to seek an agreement with Mexico to assist in accommodating a steady stream of migrants traveling through Mexico seeking asylum. The senators noted acknowledgements by Obama Administration officials that potential security threats are exploiting immigration vulnerabilities to enter the United States.
In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the senators urged the Trump Administration to adopt a safe third country agreement with Mexico similar to an existing agreement between the United States and Canada. Safe third country agreements require migrants seeking asylum to make their claim in the first country of arrival rather than passing through to another country. Such an agreement would serve American interests by helping to prevent expanded asylum claim backlogs and promoting national security by further disrupting migration of Special Interest Aliens, whom the Obama Administration noted are seeking entry into the United States.
“We know now that this caravan, as it stands currently, is not entirely comprised of Central American asylum seekers. As then-President Obama’s own Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, noted in an agency memorandum, titled Cross-Border Movement of Special Interest Aliens: ‘we must continually evaluate our border and port of entry security posture to ensure our resources are appropriately aligned to address trends in the migration of SIAs,’” the senators wrote.
“For over a decade now, United States sovereignty has been tested and too often disregarded. Under President Trump’s Administration, and due in large part to both of your efforts, the United States is finally in a position to secure our border and reinstitute law and order. We strongly urge you – on the eve of a new Mexican presidential administration – to set the tone for American sovereignty in the twenty-first century. Entering into a safe third country agreement with Mexico would send a message to our partners across Central America that they too must share the burden of unsanctioned mass migration.”
Grassley has
previously raised concern
about reports that migrants with ties to terrorism or from countries known to be a high risk for anti-American terrorism are joining smuggling rings in Central America in order to enter the United States via the Southern border.
Grassley’s and Lee’s letter to Nielsen and Pompeo
follows:
October 23, 2018
The Honorable Kirstjen Nielsen
Secretary
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C. 20528
The Honorable Mike Pompeo
Secretary
U.S. Department of State
Washington, D.C. 20520
Dear Secretary Nielsen and Secretary Pompeo:
As over 7,000 Hondurans travel through Mexico toward the United States border, we urge you to execute a safe third country agreement with the Mexican government that requires asylum seekers to make their claims in their first country of arrival. We believe this would be an appropriate next step because such an agreement is rooted in precedent, addresses our national security concerns, and serves the best interests of American citizens.
A safe third country agreement is not unprecedented. In 2002, the United States entered into an agreement with Canada for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries. The 2002 Safe Third Country Agreement with Canada required those seeking refugee status to make their claim in the first country of arrival. Given our shared land borders with both Canada and Mexico, and the decade-long surge of illegal immigration across our southern border, such an agreement is both appropriate and just. Further, there is international precedent. The Dublin Regulation[1] required asylum seekers arriving in the European Union to register their claims in the first country of arrival, and the EU-Turkey 2016 Agreement required Syrian migrants to file their claims in Turkey if they arrived in Greece via the Mediterranean Sea.[2] The United States, which is by far the most generous nation in the world, should also take appropriate steps to legally defend our own sovereignty.
A safe third country agreement with Mexico would also address national security concerns inherent in a large group of unidentified individuals moving unabated toward the United States. We know now that this caravan, as it stands currently, is not entirely comprised of Central American asylum seekers. As then-President Obama’s own Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, noted in an agency memorandum, titled Cross-Border Movement of Special Interest Aliens: “we must continually evaluate our border and port of entry security posture to ensure our resources are appropriately aligned to address trends in the migration of SIAs.”[3] As you know, Special Interest Aliens or “SIAs” are individuals who are considered national security threats to our homeland, who attempt – often successfully – to enter the interior of the United States illegally. We need only look back to a 2017 investigative report from POLITICO that showed Hezbollah and their affiliated networks have trafficked narcotics, weapons and persons from Venezuela and other parts of Latin America, to the United States.[4] Of particular concern is Guatemala’s recent announcement that it apprehended 100 ISIS terrorists in country, raising new security concerns about whether similar high risk individuals may have joined the caravan.[5] Due to the likelihood that such national security threats could mask themselves within this large caravan population, at a minimum, our federal government must prioritize the security of American citizens over anything else.
A safe third country agreement also permits the federal government to address overdue fixes we need here at home, within our immigration laws and border security apparatus. Our border and immigration enforcement authorities are long overdue for aggressive increases in resources, technology, and infrastructure support. Further, our country’s legal system that would be tasked with processing the thousands of migrants’ claims for asylum is already in a dire state, and likely cannot withstand the incoming pressure. According to the FY 2019 Proposed Refugee Admissions Report, the number of pending affirmative asylum cases stands at about 320,000 (approximately 492,000 individuals).[6] This is in addition to the immigration asylum backlog, which stands at about 348,000 individuals.[7] Accepting this current caravan would add thousands of cases to our existing backlog, and send a message to future populations that the United States has open borders, all funded off the backs of American taxpayers and legal immigrants.
For over a decade now, United States sovereignty has been tested and too often disregarded. Under President Trump’s Administration, and due in large part to both of your efforts, the United States is finally in a position to secure our border and reinstitute law and order. We strongly urge you – on the eve of a new Mexican presidential administration – to set the tone for American sovereignty in the twenty-first century. Entering into a safe third country agreement with Mexico would send a message to our partners across Central America that they too must share the burden of unsanctioned mass migration.

Title: Sen. Lee Calls for End to U.S.-Saudi War in Yemen
Date: October 22, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – In light of Saudi Arabia’s admission that they killed Jamal Khashoggi, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Monday calling for an end to United States involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen.
“Killing a United States resident is never acceptable behavior, and the repeated failure to be honest about the incident should call into question the extent of our relationship with Saudi Arabia,” Sen. Lee said. “But setting aside the extent of our alliance generally, why should we continue to support Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen when the kingdom is killing our residents and lying about it? It is far past time that the United States Senate had a serious debate regarding our military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.”
This February, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) introduced a resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities between Saudi Arabia and Houthi forces in Yemen. This March, before the Senate voted to table that resolution, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) asked fellow senators to “respect the members of the foreign relations committee that deal with this issue” and let the resolution “go back to committee with the commitment that we plan to bring forth legislation to actually deal appropriately with many of the issues relative to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and ourselves.”
"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has had six months to study the resolution to end U.S. aid to Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen,” Lee said. “It is time for a vote.”

Title: ICYMI: Sen. Lee's Solution Summit
Date: October 15, 2018

Content:
In case you missed it, last Friday Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined with Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, DEA District Agent in Charge for the State of Utah Brian Besser, the DEA 360 Program, and others to host the 5th Annual Solutions Summit: Instead – Connecting for a Cure.
Senator Lee has hosted the Solutions Summit annually since 2013, focusing on a different topic each year. This year, Sen. Lee chose to work with his fellow co-chairs on the Utah Opioid Task Force to put together an all-day event focusing on the opioid crisis. The decision was made to focus on the crisis as it touches all states, all classes, and affects all of us.
You can read local coverage of the event below. Please let us know if you have any questions or would like more information on the summit or the Senator’s efforts to combat the crisis.
The Deseret News
– “At the Utah Solutions Summit, the message to Utah youths was clear: Don’t die for a high.”
“That opioid addiction is real was quickly clear when Jim Wahlberg asked those who have lost a family member or friend to addiction to stand. Like that, roughly half of those in the arena were on their feet.”
The Deseret News
– “Making drug addicts feel needed would help solve
opioid
crisis, noted author says.”
“Faith in God and serving others, [Bob Woodson] said, is missing in many discussions about drug addiction and suicide. Feelings of emptiness and lack of meaning in life causes people to destroy themselves and others, he said.
Woodson also said looking to those who have overcome addiction or survived crime-infested neighbors would provide mentors for young people”
ABC 4 Good4Utah – “Annual Summit hosted by Senator Lee to focus on
opioid
crisis.”
“Last year, our state reversed the trend and saw fewer opioid-related deaths. It's a positive step, but there is still a tough road ahead. Senator Lee's summit is about traveling that road together because the opioid epidemic knows no boundaries.”
Deseret News – In our opinion: Answers to opioid abuse must be local in nature.
“But the answers to this nationwide scourge must be local in nature, in order to be effective. That’s why the Utah Opioid Task Force, including government, medical and law-enforcement professionals, has seen success. The same holds for groups such as the Utah Coalition for Opioid Overdose Prevention and the Other Side Academy.”

The general session, which was held in the afternoon, focused on enabling communication and support across the various communities involved in combating the crisis.
While the co-chairs were pleased with the success of the summit, they stressed the importance of continuing this effort beyond today’s events. “The way we keep the momentum going is by connecting to the communities,” DEA District Agent in Charge for the State of Utah Brian Besser said. “We are wearing our tires out traveling around the state. We spend most of our time finding those who are hardest hit, listening, and learning how we can help."
The Utah Solutions Summit was made possible by the following partnerships: US Senator Mike Lee, Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes, Utah Opioid Task Force, DEA 360 Strategy, Sutherland Institute, Utah Anti-Bullying Coalition, The 525 Foundations, Salt Lake Chamber, and The Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation.

“There are some very good elements in this opioid response bill, including strengthening U.S. Customs and Border Protection authority to discover and destroy packages containing illegal controlled substances. Unfortunately, the bill also includes dozens of new grant programs with little accountability for how the dollars will be spent and minimal measurement or analysis on their effectiveness. Good intentions are not enough. In the face of a crisis such as this, we cannot afford to waste precious funds on programs which likely won’t work.”
“What we ought to do is focus our efforts on the state and local level – where we can best tailor our solutions and effectively reach people succumbing to the grip of the opioid crisis. American lives depend upon it.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Screening Partnership Reform Act
Date: September 18, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Yesterday. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Screening Partnership Reform Act, a bill that would make changes to the Transportation Safety Administration’s Screening Partnership Program.
“While the Screening Partnership program has existed for almost 20 years, only 22 airports participate in the program, despite its safety record and cost-effectiveness,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill would clear some of the bureaucratic red-tape surrounding this program in an attempt to unleash the potential cost-saving benefits of these private screening contractors, while also simplifying the application process and improving the efficiency of our screenings. Simply put – this bill would save American’s money and make them safer.”
The bill would codify reforms to TSA’s cost estimation process to make it more accurate by including all federal government costs, including government benefits, when assessing how much the government would spend on a contract. It would allow private screening companies to annually submit recommendations on how to improve the screening processes and also empowers airports to make the decision whether to go with a TSA contract or a TSA-approved private screening company.

Title: Sen. Lee Offers Opening Statements on Day 1 of Kavanaugh Hearings
Date: September 4, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) participated in the first day of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. His opening remarks, as prepared, were as follows:
“Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Judge Kavanaugh, welcome, and welcome to your family and guests.
This is the third time you’ve had the quote-unquote privilege of appearing before this Committee. So you’re seeing some familiar faces on this side of the dais. You’re also seeing some new faces, but I think you’ll find that in a lot of ways, nothing has really changed since you were last here 12 years ago.
Over the next few days, Senators will ask you questions about Supreme Court cases, your record, and your qualifications. Some of these questions will be fair. Many others will be unfair. And some of these unfair questions will ask you to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases that are likely to come before the Court.
When you look at the history, that is precisely why confirmation hearings developed—so that Senators could ask nominees how they would vote in particular cases.
The first Supreme Court confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, when Justice Brandeis was nominated. Brandeis was controversial for several reasons—including, it has to be said, because he was Jewish. But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use a seat on the Supreme Court to advocate for the progressive causes he championed as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he would vote in particular cases. They didn’t ask Brandeis to testify, but asked outside witnesses to talk about his nomination.
The next important moment was in 1939, when Justice Frankfurter became the first nominee to testify before the Senate. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas. But Senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, Senators wanted assurances that Frankfurter would reach certain results. Frankfurter, however, declined to engage with Senators and insisted that his public record spoke for itself.
Justice Stewart’s 1959 nomination was another turning point. Senators seeking to resist
Brown v. Board of Education
wanted to grill Stewart about his views on integration. Others wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security. So Senators turned-up the heat a bit more in that hearing. Like Frankfurter before him, Stewart did not provide substantive answers to their questions.
Twenty-eight years later, the Senate considered Robert Bork’s nomination. This was another turning point, and in my view, remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate. Without getting into the gory details, suffice to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on constitutional law. Kennedy’s response was to savage – unfairly – the results he thought Bork would reach.
This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created a norm in which members demand that nominees talk about specific cases in return for favorable treatment.
Nominees, for the most part, have resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises on how they’ll vote. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whether
Marbury v. Madison
was settled law, on the ground that it could come before him. And sure enough, last term in
Ortiz v. United States
, the Supreme Court considered a case implicating the scope of
Marbury
. Likewise, Justice Ginsburg created the so-called “Ginsburg standard”—no previews, forecasts, or hints. Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle.
Even though nominees have not caved to the pressure, I still believe the Senate’s approach does a disservice to the country. If Senators repeatedly ask nominees about outcomes, the public is entitled to think that judges are supposed to be outcome-oriented. This undermines the legitimacy of the courts. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle.
There’s a better way for the Senate to approach its work. This process should be about your qualifications, your character, and your approach to judging. It should not be about results in a select number of cases.
You are obviously qualified. Even your staunchest critics would not claim otherwise.
You are independent. You’ve written that “some of the greatest moments in American judicial history have been when judges stood up to the other branches, were not cowed, and enforced the law.” You’ve said that judges “cannot be buffaloed, influenced, or pressured into worrying too much about transient popularity when we are trying to decide a case” and that “one of the most important duties of a judge” is to “stand up for the unpopular party who has the correct position.”
And you’ve lived-up to those words during your time on the bench. Everyone knows you served in the Bush administration. Yet when you became a judge, in only two years, you ruled against Bush a total of 8 times. For you, it simply does not matter who the parties are. The only thing that matters is correct application of the law.
As far as your approach to judging, you have appropriate respect for precedent. You co-authored an 800-page book on precedent that, among other things, explains that a change in a court’s membership alone “should not throw former decisions open to reconsideration or justify their reversal.” You’ve explained that, for a precedent to be overruled, it must be “not just wrong but a case with serious practical consequences.” You’ve voted to overturn circuit precedent only four times during your time on the D.C. Circuit—and each of those cases were unanimous. And you follow binding precedent even if you believe it’s wrongly decided.
You decide cases on the legal merits, not based on the identity of the parties or your political beliefs. We’ve already heard that your nomination will be bad for women, the environment, labor unions, and civil rights. I have a laundry list of cases in which you’ve ruled for each of these groups.
But there’s a more fundamental point: The judiciary’s decisions are legitimate only if they are based on sound legal principle. And ruling for a preferred party is not a sound legal principle. Jury-rigging decisions and backfilling legal reasoning to reach a particular result—no matter how desirable—is not a legitimate mode of judicial decision-making. No free people would accept it.
So my plea to my colleagues is that we ask Judge Kavanaugh hard questions. I believe we are required to. The Senate is not and should not be a rubber stamp. But if you disagree with an opinion he’s written, make a legal argument. Explain why you think it’s wrong. Don’t complain about the result as if it’s
proof
that he’s wrong. And don’t ask him to make promises. If it’s unacceptable for the president to impose a litmus test, it’s surely unacceptable for the Senate to do so.
Judge Kavanaugh, I look forward to your testimony.
Thank you."

Title: Criminal Justice Reform Likely to See Vote After Midterms
Date: August 23, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) participated in two meetings to discuss what elements would be included in a possible criminal justice reform bill that would be taken up by the Senate after the midterm elections. Sen. Lee released the following statement on the possible bill after the meetings:
“Today’s meeting was a huge step forward in getting a bill passed that will help keep communities safe and make our criminal justice system more fair,” Lee said. “The bill we agreed to would include the prison reforms from the House’s First Step Act with some technical changes, plus four sentencing reforms that would give judges more flexibility on mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders. I hope to see this bill passed by the end of the year, and expect large bipartisan support as we strive to make our penal system work better for all Americans.”
The first meeting was attended by Senior Presidential Advisor Jared Kushner, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. Lee. The second meeting was with Chairman Grassley, Mr. Kushner, Sen. Lee, and included President Donald Trump on the phone to discuss the elements of a possible compromise bill.

Title: Sen. Lee Letter on Possible T-Mobile/Sprint Merger
Date: August 7, 2018

Content:
Yesterday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission highlighting testimony presented at the June 27, 2018, hearing on the proposed T-Mobile US and Sprint merger. The letter draws the agencies’ attention to important issues raised by witnesses appearing at the hearing, including the resulting increase in market concentration in the wireless telecommunications industry, and the potential for the merger to create a more competitive wireless carrier. In particular, the letter addresses the potential for significant efficiencies that would benefit consumers.
The letter reads, in part:
“Perhaps the key argument the parties have made in support of their proposed transaction is that by combining their particular spectrum and infrastructure assets, the merger will increase the combined firm’s capacity. According to T-Mobile and Sprint, this resulting expansion in capacity would provide the merged firm with incentives to lower prices to attract customers. Such efficiency claims, if supported by verifiable evidence, suggest the merger could, on the whole, benefit, rather than harm, consumers. However, I recognize that merging parties are often unable to provide evidence supporting such claims, as Sprint itself alleged in its challenge to AT&T’s earlier attempt to acquire T-Mobile.”

Title: Sen. Lee Celebrates Pioneer Day with 2nd Annual Taste of Utah
Date: July 25, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON - This evening, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and the Utah delegation celebrated Pioneer Day and Utah’s continued pioneering and industrious spirit at the 2nd Annual Taste of Utah in Washington, D.C. This year’s event hosted over 500 attendees who learned about, enjoyed product from, and interacted with business owners from over 20+ Utah businesses representing food, manufacturing, and more.
“What started as a small event hosted out of my Washington D.C. office with jello and homemade root beer floats has grown into a widely attended event highlighting some great Utah companies and products,” Sen. Lee said. “Utah is an awesome state; it’s a great place to raise a family, have kids, and start a business, and Utahns are an industrious, hardworking, and caring people. I’m happy to host this event that highlights Utah’s heritage and hard work, and I look forward to working with the Utah Food Industry Association to continue growing this event in years to come.”
Taste of Utah gives Utah businesses owners the opportunity to showcase their product and meet directly with policymakers and the Washington, D.C. community, and is sponsored by the Utah Food Industry Association and other Utah companies.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Constitutionally Sound Tort Reform
Date: July 20, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after introducing the Federal Courts Access Act of 2018, Thursday.
“For too long, trial lawyers have been able to manipulate the diversity jurisdiction rules to deny litigants their day in federal court,” Sen. Lee said. “By creating a minimal diversity requirement consistent with the vision of the very first Congress, this bill increases out-of-state litigants access to the federal courts for major controversies. By returning to first principles, we can increase both fairness and efficiency in the civil litigation system.”
The framers of the Constitution were well aware of the dangers state court biased posed to national commerce. That is why from the beginning they created “diversity” jurisdiction, thus allowing litigants from out of state access to federal courts.
But thanks to an 1806 Supreme Court case, plaintiffs now only need to identify one in-state defendant to defeat diversity jurisdiction. This bill fixes that problem by allowing access to federal court for any case where at least one defendant is from out of state.

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on European Commission Google Decisions
Date: July 18, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday responding to the European Commission’s Google decision.
“Today’s decision by the European Commission to fine Google over $5 billion and require significant changes to its business model to satisfy EC bureaucrats has the potential to undermine competition and innovation in the United States,” Sen. Lee said. “Moreover, the decision further demonstrates the different approaches to competition policy between U.S. and EC antitrust enforcers. As discussed at the hearing held last December before the Senate’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights, U.S. antitrust agencies analyze business practices based on the consumer welfare standard. This analytical framework seeks to protect consumers rather than competitors. A competitive marketplace requires strong antitrust enforcement. However, appropriate competition policy should serve the interests of consumers and not be used as a vehicle by competitors to punish their successful rivals.”

Title: Allied Burden Sharing Report Act of 2018
Date: July 12, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Allied Burden Sharing Report Act (S. 3198). The act would require the Department of Defense to resume compiling and submitting an extensive report that includes the common defense contributions of NATO countries and other allies, including GCC countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand.
“NATO and other mutual defense agreements have a purpose,” Sen. Lee said, “but until we no longer bear the greatest brunt of the financial burden, we cannot and should not consider expanding these commitments. The information included in this report would be instrumental in informing Congress’ oversight of our own military and defense spending and would help educate lawmakers on the return on investment we receive in exchange for our involvement in global alliances.”
The report would be submitted annually to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Protect Utah’s Rural Economy (PURE) Act
Date: July 11, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Protect Utah’s Rural Economy (PURE) Act Wednesday, a bill that would protect Utah from presidential Antiquities Act abuse in much the same way Alaska and Wyoming are currently protected.
“Rural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified decent-paying job, a family to love and support, and a healthy community whose future is determined by local residents – not their self-styled betters thousands of miles away,” Sen. Lee said.
“That is why I am introducing the Protecting Utah’s Rural Economy Act today, a bill that would protect Utah from future abuses under the Antiquities Act by prohibiting the president from establishing or expanding a national monument in Utah unless the proposed monument has been authorized by an act of Congress and the state legislature.”
Passed in 1906, the Antiquities Act was originally intended to protect objects of historic and cultural interest like artifacts and religious sites. Unfortunately, what was once a narrowly targeted tool for preventing looting on federal lands has become a weapon urban elites use against hard working rural Americans.
Two states, Alaska and Wyoming, both received protections from future Antiquities Act designations after millions of acres were restricted in those states. The PURE Act would give Utah’s rural communities a real voice in local land management policies, a voice they currently do not have today.

Title: Sens. Lee, Rubio, Cruz Introduce Transportation Empowerment Act
Date: July 10, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the Transportation Empowerment Act, a bill which would give states and localities far more control over their infrastructure spending by phasing out the federal gas tax. The bill is cosponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).
“The federal government’s Highway Trust Fund is broke, and another year of band aid funding is not going to fix it,” Sen. Lee said. “Different states have different values and needs. State and local governments are perfectly capable of reflecting those values and meeting those needs with unique, customized transportation policies without the interference of politicians, bureaucrats, and special interests in Washington. The Interstate Highway System was completed decades ago, drivers are buying less gas, and the federal government has wasted far too much money on non-highway projects. It is just an outdated system that is long overdue for reform.”
“Having a 21st century infrastructure means empowering states with greater flexibility to prioritize the infrastructure needs of their local communities,” Sen. Rubio said. “The Transportation Empowerment Act offers a viable solution to address the fiscal cliff facing the Highway Trust Fund, and will allow donor states, like Florida, to receive a better return on our infrastructure investments.”
“The Transportation Empowerment Act is a critical step in returning authority to the states,” Sen. Cruz said. “The strength and growth of American infrastructure is necessary to our economic future, and they are best achieved when we allow communities to assign resources according to their own needs, not far-off bureaucrats in Washington.”

WASHINGTON - Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ed Markey (D-MA) released the following joint statement regarding Orlando International Airport’s recent commitment to use facial recognition technology on all international travelers traveling through their airport.
“The Department of Homeland Security previously indicated its intention to begin a formal rulemaking process for the biometric exit program at U.S. airports this year. Before expanding the program, DHS should complete this formal rulemaking process to address critical privacy and security concerns. American travelers deserve to know exactly who has access to their facial recognition data, how their information will be safeguarded, and how they can opt out of the program altogether.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Sanders Call on Sec. Mattis to Disclose Full US Involvement in Yemen
Date: June 15, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sent a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis today asking for details on the United States’ involvement in the Saudi’s war in Yemen, and to do so before US involvement in those hostilities intensifies. The letter expresses concern that Congress’s attempt to play their proper Constitutional oversight role may be impeded by Pentagon officials withholding information, leading to a violation of the War Powers Act of 1973.
The letter reads, in part:
“We call on you to immediately disclose the full extent of the U.S. military role in the Saudi-led war against Yemen’s Houthis, including the use of special operations forces; disclose any role that the Pentagon is currently performing, has been asked to perform, or is considering performing regarding an attack on the port of Hodeida; and issue a public declaration opposing this impending assault and restating the Administration’s position that Saudi Arabia and other parties to the conflict should accept an immediate ceasefire and move toward a political settlement to resolve the conflict.”
Today’s letter follows a previous letter sent by Sens. Lee, Sanders, and Chris Murphy (D-CT) on May 17, 2018 asking for details on US involvement in Yemen. The letter went unanswered; this, combined with the continued progression toward increased hostilities in the region prompted the need for this additional letter. A similar letter was sent by members of the US House of Representatives earlier this week on June 12th.

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley, and Murkowski Introduce Inspector General Access Act of 2018
Date: June 6, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the Inspector General Access Act of 2018 today, a bill that would expand the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General to include alleged DOJ attorney misconduct.
“Our federal government inspectors general do a valuable job providing the information voters and lawmakers need to hold federal government agencies accountable,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately the Department of Justice OIG currently does not have the power to review the conduct of DOJ attorneys, an oversight which this legislation corrects.”
“Misconduct by DOJ attorneys is a serious matter and should be investigated by an independent Inspector General, not by other Department attorneys, so there is no real or perceived conflict of interest. This bill ensures that the Justice Department’s inspector general is able to access and independently evaluate allegations of misconduct by Justice Department attorneys,” Grassley said.
The Inspector General Access Act of 2018 is identical to the bipartisan Inspector General Access Act of 2015. Both bills amend Section 8E of the Inspector General Act of 1978 by removing the requirement that the DOJ OIG refer all allegations of DOJ attorney misconduct to the Office of Professional Responsibility.
“One of the key lessons learned from the case of the late Senator Ted Stevens is that the Justice Department desperately needs a credible, independent watchdog to examine attorney misconduct. Currently, the independent Inspector General of the Department of Justice has jurisdiction to investigate every component of the agency with the exception of the attorneys. This legislation gives the Justice Department’s Inspector General the jurisdiction to objectively examine the actions of the legal staff, ensuring the Senator Stevens’ experience is never repeated.”

Title: Conservative Senators Introduce White House Rescission Bills
Date: May 25, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), David Perdue (R-GA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) introduced the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act Thursday, a bill that would formally rescind the $15 billion in unneeded spending identified by the White House on May 8, 2018.
“Yes, a $15 billion spending reduction is a drop in the bucket compared to a $15 trillion debt,” Sen. Lee said. “But we have to start cutting spending somewhere. Because if we don’t, if we continue to allow federal government spending to grow faster than the economy as a whole, at some point economic reality will force us to do so in a much more painful manner later.”
“Our country doesn’t have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem,” Sen. Johnson said. “While these cuts won’t solve our debt problems – far from it – they are an important step in the right direction by eliminating unnecessary and excessive spending throughout the federal government.”
“This proposal will help end the deception where Congress over funds popular programs like CHIP only to shift the excess money to unrelated programs when the American people aren’t looking,” Sen. Toomey said. “It is a modest but important step in the direction of honest budgeting and protecting taxpayers.”
“Rescinding these dollars now ensures that Congress doesn’t use them as a budget gimmick later,” Sen. Ernst said. “This rescissions bill is a common-sense initiative to ensure that the federal government is a better and more effective steward of hard-working Americans’ money.”
“We are past the tipping point in this debt crisis,” said Sen. Perdue. “Today, most of the money we spend on our military, our veterans, and domestic discretionary programs is borrowed money. This will get worse and it’s time for Washington to come to grips with this reality. President Trump has—that’s why his team is proposing to cut these unused and expired government programs. These are simple cuts, arguably the easiest we could make, and they should be supported by every member in Congress.”
“Washington has long been spending tax dollars like a bunch of drunken sailors with zero regard for the debt we are loading onto future generations. This bill is a small step but a good start towards restoring a little fiscal sanity to the swamp,” said Sen. Kennedy.
“Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to cut one penny from every dollar through a budget bill I proposed last week. I am hopeful they will support cutting half a penny from every dollar through this rescissions package,” Sen. Paul said.
The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974 empowers the president to send a rescission message to Congress specifying the accounts, programs, and amounts to be rescinded. The funds are then locked down for 45 days allowing Congress to either approve, modify, or ignore the president’s rescission request.
According to Senate rules, all rescission legislation must go to committee where the committee then has 25 days to act before the legislation can be discharged to the floor. By introducing this legislation today, that 25-day window for discharge will run out before the 45-day window for congressional action.

Title: Sens. Lee, Klobuchar Announce Hearing on T-Mobile-Sprint Merger

WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, will hold a subcommittee hearing June 27th on the proposed T-Mobile-Sprint Merger.
“Few industries touch Americans’ daily lives as much as the wireless market,” Sen. Lee said. “As Chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I want to make sure that the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint benefits consumers in a manner consistent with existing antitrust law.”
"The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint raises serious antitrust issues. Competition among the four largest cell phone carriers has led to lower prices, better service and more innovation. That’s why it’s critically important that we hold a hearing to ask serious questions about how this consolidation could affect American consumers,” said Sen. Klobuchar.

Title: Sens. Lee, Tester Introduce Pay for Printing Act

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jon Tester (D-MT) introduced the Pay for Printing Act Tuesday, a bill that would require any sponsor of a commemorative Senate resolution to reimburse the Government Publishing Office for the cost of printing the resolution.
“We are not going to cut our federal government’s $20 trillion national debt by cutting government printing costs,” Sen. Lee said. “But the House and Senate passed 708 resolutions last Congress, and every single one of these resolutions cost taxpayer money to print. If we are going to ask the American people to help cut the deficit, we in Washington should be willing to foot the bill for every commemorative resolution we want Congress to pass.”
“Montanans want their hard-earned dollars going towards our troops and schools, not printing unnecessary reams of paper,” Tester said. “I am partnering with Senator Lee so we can hold Congress accountable and curb Washington’s bad habit of spending other people’s money on exorbitance and waste.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Monday responding to news that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has withdrawn a computer assessment database that HUD was planning to use to perpetuate national zoning standards.
“Every American should be free to choose where to live, and every community should be free to compete for new residents according to its distinct values,” Sen. Lee said. “What our communities do not need is another costly government mandate that makes it harder for local communities to govern. While ending the complicated assessment tool positively reduces burdensome paperwork, rescinding the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule is the best way to remove the federal government from yet another overreach into local and state decision making.”

Title: Sen. Lee Seeks Biking Access in Wilderness Areas
Date: May 17, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act Thursday, a bill that would empower local managers of wilderness areas to decide whether to allow and how to regulate non-motorized travel in wilderness areas.
“The National Wilderness Preservation System was created so that the American people could enjoy our country’s priceless natural areas,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill would enrich Americans’ enjoyment of the outdoors by expanding recreational opportunities in wilderness areas.”
Specifically, the bill would:
Give local wilderness managers two years to determine whether to open routes in their wilderness areas to non-motorized travel
If a local manager fails to make a determination regarding which routes to open or keep closed within two years, all routes in that official’s wilderness jurisdiction would be open to non- motorized travel unless and until the official affirmatively closes them.
Local wilderness managers would retain authority to open and close routes and regulate their use after the initial two-year window.
Land managers would be free to regulate non-motorized travel in their jurisdictions however they see fit, such as by requiring a permit, limiting group size, establishing speed limits, etc.

Title: Sens. Lee, Hatch, Tillis, and Grassley Introduce SMARTER Act
Date: May 15, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, Tuesday, a bill that would require the Federal Trade Commission to go through the same procedures that the Department of Justice must go through when enforcing antitrust law, and would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue merger review decisions expeditiously.
“The only people that benefit from uncertainty in antitrust law are antitrust lawyers,” Sen. Lee said. “Both businesses and consumers deserve clarity and certainty when it comes to federal antitrust law enforcement and the SMARTER Act would create a simpler and more equal system.”
“This is an important issue for the business community and for all Americans,” Sen. Hatch said. “There is no good reason for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to apply different standards in enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Businesses seeking to merge deserve consistent treatment without regard to which agency decides to review the merger. I look forward to working with Senator Lee to move this legislation forward to bring much-needed reforms to the merger review process.”
“The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice currently unnecessarily apply different procedures and standards for reviewing proposed mergers,” said Sen. Tillis. “This commonsense legislation will streamline the enforcement of our federal antitrust laws by creating a system of consistency that will benefit consumers and businesses.”
The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission share concurrent jurisdiction to review proposed mergers for compliance with the antitrust laws but it is not always clear in advance which agency will review a particular merger.
Although the two antitrust agencies apply the same substantive law to the mergers they review, their procedures differ in important ways.
The SMARTER Act fixes this problem by requiring the Commission to satisfy the same standards that DOJ must meet in order to obtain a preliminary injunction to block a merger and requiring the Commission to litigate the merits of contested merger cases in federal court under the Clayton Act—just as DOJ does—rather than before its own administrative tribunals.
Separately, certain mergers also require approval of the Federal Communications Commission. However, the Federal Communications Commission’s merger review procedures create an open-ended process that fuels uncertainty and is potentially insulated from judicial review. The SMARTER Act fixes this problem by requiring the Commission to issue a decision within 180 days of receiving a completed merger application.

Title: Sen. Lee Welcomes White House Rescissions Package
Date: May 8, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after the White House sent a message to Congress, pursuant to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, requesting the rescission of more than $15 billion in federal spending.
“Our federal government is set to spend more than $300 billion in interest payments alone this year, and those payments are set to rise significantly in coming years as federal spending continues to outpace economic growth,” Sen. Lee said.
“If we do not find the will to reduce federal spending ourselves now, at some point economic reality will force us to do it much more painfully later. That is why today’s White House request for $15 billion in spending rescissions is such a welcome first step to bringing our out of control spending habit back in line.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after President Trump announced the United States would exercise its right to exit the executive agreement the previous administration had entered into with Iran.
“It is unfortunate that the previous administration rushed to produce an executive agreement with Iran that it knew could never withstand the scrutiny of the United States Senate. I hope that the current administration will be able to negotiate a better deal and that when it does it will submit the resulting treaty to the Senate for ratification as required by the Constitution."

SALT LAKE CITY – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday after reading reports of United States armed forces activity on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border.
“Media reports of U.S. ground troop activity countering Yemen Houthi rebels concerns me for a number of reasons. First, this fits an all too familiar pattern in the Senate where we get information from media outlets before the appropriate federal sources. This is particularly concerning since Congress has not authorized the types of activities that have been reported. The Department of Defense and State Department owe Members a full and honest briefing about this new information.”

Title: Sen. Lee Responds to President’s Letter on Syria Strike
Date: April 16, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Monday in response to a White House letter purporting to identify sufficient constitutional authority for Friday night’s attack on Syria.
“No President of the United States, no matter party or political ideology, has the authority to unilaterally start a war. While the president has the authority under the War Powers Act to respond when the U.S. is under attack or in imminent danger, such circumstances did not exist with regard to Syria. Promoting regional stability, mitigating humanitarian catastrophe, and deterring the use of chemical weapons might be important foreign policy goals, but if they are to be pursued with military force, a president must first seek congressional authorization.”

Title: Utah Tops Social Capital Index of United States
Date: April 11, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress issued a new report Wednesday, showing that Utah has the highest level of social capital of any state in the nation.
The Social Capital Index is a first time report that provides social capital scores for 2,992 of the country’s 3,142 counties, all 50 states, and the District of Columbia. It uses county- and state-level data on a range of social, economic, demographic, health, religious, and other indicators to measure the health of each locality's “associational life.”
“Associational life” is the shorthand the Social Capital Project uses for the web of social relationships through which we pursue joint endeavors—namely, our families, our communities, our workplaces, and our religious congregations.
The 12 states with the highest social capital scores are distributed across two continuous blocs: nine states running from Utah, through Wyoming and Colorado, across the Dakotas and Nebraska, and over to Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin; and the three Northern New England states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. These states tend to rank highly across all seven subindices as well. Utah has the highest social capital score, followed by Minnesota and Wisconsin.
“Today a lot of our communities are struggling with challenges like addiction, family breakdown, and isolation. Obviously, some communities are hurting much more than others. So before we can do something about it, we first have to know where our civil society is flourishing and where it’s not,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said. “This report is a tool. The Index gives us a lens through which to look at both problems and solutions going forward.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Aviation Empowerment Act

WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Aviation Empowerment Act. The bill aims to reduce regulations on America’s pilots by more tightly defining key terms in the Federal Aviation Authority’s 1986 Advisory Circular and creating a new class of pilot.
“Innovation is key to competition and accessibility,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill adds definition and clarity to existing rules that will help unleash that innovation in the aviation community. Studies and experience with cost-sharing services have proven to be safe and effective in other countries, and it is past time we enact them in our country."

Title: Sens. Grassley and Lee Call for Oversight of DOJ Prosecutors
Date: March 23, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Thursday, asking for an update on the Justice Department’s inquiry into alleged prosecutorial misconduct regarding Vascular Solutions, Inc.
In February 2016, Vascular Solutions, Inc. was acquitted on all charges of a conspiracy to promote a medical device product for off-label uses. Allegations have since been made that federal prosecutors threatened witnesses to change their testimony during prosecution and have since retaliated against Vascular Solutions CEO Howard Root.
“Taken together, these reports suggest a pattern of threatened and actual retribution against defendants and witnesses borne out of the Department’s disappointment with the outcome of a particular case. This not only casts doubt on the Department’s ability to accept the results of judicial proceedings in a professional manner befitting the nation’s preeminent law enforcement agency, but it significantly undermines our confidence in its commitment to hold government attorneys accountable for questionable actions that may have occurred in the course of this case or other cases.”
The letter goes on to identify seven specific questions for the Department and asks the Department to respond by April 5, 2018.

Title: Senators Respond to Pentagon’s Yemen War Letter
Date: March 13, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) responded to a Department of Defense letter last week that outlined the Pentagon’s opposition to a War Powers Resolution motion that would end United States involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.
“For too long, and under both parties, Congress has abdicated its responsibility to provide authorization for the use of military force,” the senators’ letter reads. “S.J. Res. 54 begins the process of reasserting congressional responsibility for the decision to commit U.S. armed forces to military conflict. Regardless of what one thinks of our involvement in Yemen, as we enter a fourth year of helping the Saudis prosecute this war it is important that Congress either provides express authorization for our involvement in the conflict or calls on the president to cease operations.”
On February 27, DoD sent a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell explaining why DoD opposed a joint resolution ending U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. The DoD’s full letter can be read below but basically the DoD made two arguments: 1) United States involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen does not constitute “hostilities” pursuant to the War Powers Resolution; and 2) Article II of the Constitution empowers the President of the United States to do what has been done in Yemen. While successive Administrations have used the broadest possible interpretation of authorizations for use of force – including stretching the 2001 AUMF beyond all recognition – they choose to use the narrowest possible definition of hostilities when it comes to denying Congress its constitutional role in deciding when U.S. forces should become involved in overseas military conflicts.
The senators’ letter identifies a number of specific activities of U.S. Armed Forces that clearly trigger the War Powers Resolution definition of “hostilities” including, “refueling operations, intelligence sharing activities, and participation in the Joint Combined Planning Cell.” The letter also notes that the DoD’s expansive understanding of Article II powers would “expand presidential … and would effectively nullify Congress’ express constitutional authority to declare war.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces First Amendment Defense Act
Date: March 8, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reintroduced the First Amendment Defense Act Thursday, a bill designed to prevent the federal government from discriminating against individuals or institutions based on their beliefs about marriage.
“What an individual or organization believes about the traditional definition of marriage is not – and should never be – a part of the government’s decision-making process when distributing licenses, accreditations, or grants,” Sen. Lee said. “And the First Amendment Defense Act simply ensures that this will always be true in America – that federal bureaucrats will never have the authority to require those who believe in the traditional definition of marriage to choose between their living in accordance with those beliefs and maintaining their occupation or their tax status.”
FADA prohibits the federal government from taking adverse action against individuals or institutions based on their definition of marriage or beliefs about premarital sex. It creates a cause of action in federal court for individuals or institutions that have been discriminated against by the government. Plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and compensatory damages.
There are currently 21 co-sponsors on the Senate bill, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Jim Risch (R-ID), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), John Hoeven (R-ND), John Thune (R-SD), Rand Paul (R-KY), David Perdue (R-GA), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Boozman (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

"Over the past century, Congress's power to declare war has been willfully eroded," Sen. Lee said. "Successive presidents have claimed that power-and the politicians in Congress have been only too happy to give it away, in order to avoid tough votes. This resolution is a first step toward Congress re-asserting its power over foreign policy decision-making. Congress can authorize-or decline to authorize-military engagements and define U.S. national interests."

"Article VI of the United States Constitution is clear: 'No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.' But that is exactly what some of my colleagues tried to do today. They voted against Russ Vought to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget solely because of his evangelical Christian beliefs. This type of religious bigotry ought to have no place in the Senate and Vought's confirmation today was a huge win for the continued health of religious liberty in this country."

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today responding to an Inter-American Court of Human Rights advisory opinion stating that Costa Rica should redefine marriage to include same-sex relationships.
“Given that the United States is the predominant funder of the Organization of American States it is of great concern that one of its international courts has issued an opinion recommending Costa Ricans to change their law,” Sen. Lee said. “The United States must do more to safeguard religious liberties around the world, prevent taxpayer dollars from funding ineffective international organizations, and most importantly uphold national sovereignty and the principles of subsidiarity.”
On January 9th, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued an advisory opinion that Costa Rica should redefine marriage to include same-sex relationships. This opinion is relevant to Costa Rica and 19 other countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean that have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction. The opinion was made in response to a petition from Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis asking the Court for its opinion on the matter.

Title: Sens. Lee, Leahy Release Joint Statement on Upcoming Debate on Section 702 Legislation
Date: January 11, 2018

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today the House of Representatives passed the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, by a vote of 256 to 167. The bill would reauthorize Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. The House also rejected an amendment offered by Congressman Amash (R-Mich.) -- by a vote of 233 to 183 — which would have provided an overhaul of Section 702 with reforms intended to protect Americans’ privacy rights. Statutory authorization for Section 702 will expire after January 19, 2018. Following is the joint statement today of Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the principal Republican and Democratic authors and sponsors of the USA Liberty Act, which reauthorizes and reforms Section 702:
“Unfortunately, the House bill falls short in providing critical protections for Americans whose communications are routinely swept up by this powerful foreign intelligence tool. In the Senate, our USA Liberty Act (S. 2158) provides a sensible compromise, preserving the government’s ability to use this important national security tool, while also protecting Americans’ fundamental Fourth Amendment privacy rights. Our bill makes clear that Americans need and deserve both security and protection of their privacy.
“Now it is time for Leader McConnell to do what Speaker Ryan did, and allow Senators a chance to vote and offer amendments on the Section 702 reauthorization debate. The American public deserves a full and transparent debate, and members of the Senate deserve to have the same opportunity as did members of the House to discuss and amend legislation reforming this vital surveillance tool.”

WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today regarding the death of former National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman Bruce Cole.
"Yesterday, our republic lost a devoted friend.
Bruce Cole dedicated his life to forming responsible and patriotic American citizens. Dr. Cole was the longest-serving chairman of the National Endowment of the Humanities, who served in that role from 2001 to 2009. He was a distinguished scholar of Renaissance art and a recipient of the Presidential Citizens Medal.
Dr. Cole believed in the power of civic education to unify Americans even in an age of doubt and division. At NEH he oversaw ‘We the People,’ an initiative to encourage all Americans to study the history and culture of their country. Later he helped launch Philadelphia’s inspiring Museum of the American Revolution, which tells the incredible story of how our nation was forged in war and spirit.
Dr. Cole also was a tireless promoter of beauty in the public square. He was a prominent critic of the dull and ugly fads that plague too many of our public spaces.Mr. Cole wanted Americans to love their surroundings as much as their country. Moreover, he wanted every American to embrace our shared cultural inheritance, the better to add to it in our time, and pass it along to posterity better than we found it. More than most, Bruce Cole did just that. He will be missed.”

Title: Sens. Markey and Lee Query Dept. of Homeland Security on Expansion of Facial Recognition Scanning Programs at U.S. Airports
Date: December 21, 2017

Content:
Washington – Senators Edward J. Markey (D-MA) and Mike Lee (R-UT), members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today called on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to answer important questions about its biometric exit program, which is currently operating at nine U.S. international airports. Currently, DHS requires travelers, including U.S. citizens, departing on select international flights to submit to a face scan so that their faces can be compared to a DHS biometric database for identity verification purposes. In their letter, Senator Markey and Lee query DHS about the accuracy, efficacy and transparency of the program. The senators highlight that under DHS’s true accept rate goal, there would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. That means thousands of travelers could be wrongfully denied boarding each day.
“We are concerned that the use of the program on U.S. citizens remains facially unauthorized,” write Senators Markey and Lee to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielson. “We request that DHS stop the expansion of this program and provide Congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on U.S. citizens.”
A copy of the letter can be found
HERE
.
Specifically, the Senators request more information from DHS on accuracy concerns and potential flaws in the scanning technology, how the program will not unduly burden travelers, including certain races or gender, how the program is improving visa overstay travel fraud, and the authority of DHS to expand the program when Congress has intentionally not authorized biometric exit scanning for U.S. citizens.
Today, the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center issued a report that revealed that while Congress has on nine separate occasions called on DHS to establish a “biometric exit” program to verify the identities of foreign nationals as they leave the country, Congress has not authorized face scans of American citizens. DHS also has not established rules governing the program. DHS also does not know whether it wrongly rejects people at higher rates as a result of their race or gender.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today after final passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
“American working families deserve a tax cut and this bill delivers it to them,” Sen. Lee said. “According to the left of center Tax Policy Center, this bill will reduce taxes for all income groups in 2018 by an average of $1,600. And according to The Washington Post, a Utah family with two kids making the median $62,000 a year would see a $1,675 tax cut. Delivering more take home pay for these working Utahn families is why I voted for this bill.”
“Now there is still a lot to be done. First and foremost we need to work with Democrats to make these middle-class tax cuts permanent. Second, we can do even more for lower-income working families by making the expanded Child Tax Credit in this bill fully refundable up to payroll tax liability.”
“I stand ready to work with anybody to make sure working American families are treated fairly by our tax code.”

“While a new location is being selected for the US Embassy, the US government will continue to serve American citizens in the region and Palestinians through our consulate in Jerusalem, just as it has done for decades since the US presence in Jerusalem was established as a consulate in 1928.

Date: December 1, 2017

WASHINGTON – Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL.) and Mike Lee (R-UT) today reaffirmed their commitment to expanding access to the child tax credit in the Senate tax reform bill.
“Our amendment would make a small change in this bill, but a huge difference in the lives of working families,” Senator Lee said.
"We need pro-growth and pro-worker tax reform, and that’s what this amendment aims to do by allowing working families to keep more of their own hard-earned money,” Senator Rubio said.
Both senators added:
“Currently, our amendment would offset the additional middle class relief with a slight increase in the corporate tax rate. We support that pay-for and believe it gives our amendment a good chance to pass on the floor with bipartisan support. But as we have said all along, we are open to alternative offsets that would preserve the 20% corporate rate, which we support as much as our Republican colleagues. We continue to welcome any effort by Finance Committee members and Republican leaders to help us identify other pay-fors to offset an expansion of the child credit.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Rubio to Introduce Child Tax Credit Refundability Amendment
Date: November 29, 2017

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) will introduce an amendment to the Senate tax bill that would give working American families a far larger share of tax relief than the existing bill currently does. Senators Rubio and Lee explained:
“We have a chance to do better by working families in this tax bill. Right now, 70 percent of the tax cuts we’re considering would go to businesses, and only 30 percent to individuals. This amendment would level the playing field for families, while still kick-starting national investment and growth. By increasing access to the Child Tax Credit, we can increase working family fairness and deliver overdue relief to America’s greatest investor class: our moms and dads.”
Specifically the Rubio-Lee amendment would:
· Make the Child Tax Credit refundable up to payroll tax liability (15.3 percent of earnings).
· Fix the marriage penalty by reducing the income phaseout threshold for the Child Tax Credit to $250,000 for all non-married filing jointly filers.
· Index the Child Tax Credit to chained CPI in accordance with other individual-side provisions.
· Increase the corporate income tax rate to 22 percent, to fully pay for the above changes.

includes an amendment filed by U.S. Senators Dean Heller (R-NV) and Tim Scott (R-SC) that would increase the child tax credit to $2,000. The current child tax credit is $1,000, and the previous version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the child tax credit to $1,650.
The Senate Finance Committee is expected to begin debating and marking up the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes the Heller-Scott amendment to significantly increase the child tax credit, tomorrow. Along with Senators Heller and Scott, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) have also led the fight within Congress to increase the child tax credit and welcome the updated provision to allow middle-class families to keep more of their paychecks.
“Giving middle-class families the biggest tax cut possible has been my first priority in tax reform, and an enhanced child tax credit is a significant way to deliver this much-needed and overdue relief to thousands of Nevada families,”
said Senator Heller
. “I’m pleased the U.S. Senate Finance Committee has adopted my and Senator Scott’s amendment to increase the credit to $2,000 per child, an increase of $1,000 over current law. This change will quite literally put thousands of dollars back into the pockets of hardworking Nevadans and represents yet another step forward in making the American dream possible again for so many people.”
"We set out to ensure that tax reform would help hardworking American families, and an increased child tax credit will do just that,"
Senator Scott said.
"As the child of a single mother, I truly can't overstate how important these dollars will be for parents across the country, be it to help buy school supplies, a new pair of sneakers or just have a night out as a family. I want to thank my colleagues for their important work on this issue."
“While I still need to see details, I welcome news from the Finance Committee that the child tax credit will be expanded to $2000. I remain committed to ensuring that tax reform provides real and meaningful relief for working American families,”
said Senator Rubio.
“I am thrilled to hear that the revised Senate tax reform proposal will double the child tax credit to $2,000 per child. Details are still being worked out, and I eagerly await their release. But if true, this could provide unprecedented tax relief for working moms and dads, and a great victory for American families,"
said Senator Lee.

Title: Sens. Lee, Rubio Release Statement on Senate Tax Plan
Date: November 9, 2017

Content:
Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) released the following statement today in response to the Senate Finance Committee unveiling their tax reform proposal:
"We appreciate all of the work our colleagues have done to draft the Senate tax bill, and the progress for tax reform that it represents. While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families.
“We continue to believe that the best way to provide real relief to working families is through a straightforward, significant, and permanent expansion of the child tax credit — preferably doubling the credit to $2,000 per child and expanding its applicability to payroll taxes. The Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn’t clearly pro-family, so we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Paul, King, Crapo, Merkley Request Defunding of Civil Asset Forfeiture Expansion
Date: November 8, 2017

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) joined with Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Angus King (I-VT), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Tom Udall (D-NM) in sending a letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL) and Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), requesting they defund the Department of Justice’s reinstated expansion of civil asset forfeiture practices.
The letter reads, in part:
“Adoptive forfeiture and equitable sharing are particularly egregious elements of civil asset forfeiture because they not only violate due process but also attack principals of federalism. DOJ’s reinstated policy allows state law enforcement officers to circumvent state limitations on civil forfeiture by turning seized property over to federal officials for forfeiture in exchange for up to 80% of the proceeds of the property. This perversely incentivizes local law enforcement to confiscate suspect property even where state laws forbid the practice.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Leahy Support USA Liberty Act
Date: November 8, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, the House Judiciary committee reported the USA Liberty Act to the House floor with 27-8 support. The bill is sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), and by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) and Ranking Member Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), and the legislation reauthorizes and reforms Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendment Act. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) partnered with these House colleagues last year to pass the USA FREEDOM act, which ended NSA bulk metadata collection and contained significant reforms to other surveillance authorities. Sens. Lee and Leahy released the following statement regarding today’s passage of the USA Liberty Act:
“We applaud the House Judiciary Committee and its Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member John Conyers for advancing legislation that would reauthorize Section 702 surveillance authorities with some important improvements. The bill codifies an end to “about” collection, closes a loophole that allows this national security tool to be used for standard domestic criminal investigations without a warrant, and contains many other provisions to protect the privacy and civil liberty interests of Americans. This bill is part of a promising, bipartisan effort to provide some long-overdue reforms to this surveillance authority.
Just as we did last Congress, we are working with both House Judiciary Committee leaders as well as with leading voices in the Senate, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein, to introduce our own strong reform bill in the Senate in the near term.”

Title: Sen. Lee Demands Transparency from CBO on Health Care and Taxes
Date: November 7, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after hearing reports that the Congressional Budget Office was in the process of changing its health care model to show that repealing the individual mandate would save significantly less money than the agency claimed just a few months ago during the heath care debate:
“I feel like I’m trapped in a game of Calvinball,” Sen. Lee said. “Just a few months ago the CBO had us playing by one set of rules for debating health care policy and now we are being told those rules have been completely changed for tax policy. This is simply unacceptable and it is why Congress must pass the CBO Show Your Work Act of 2017.”
The CBO Show Your Act would require the CBO to publish its data, models, and all details of computation used in its cost analysis and scoring. CBO would keep its role as official scorekeeper of congressional budget proposals – but now the American people and the economic community would be able to see what’s going on in all those spreadsheets and algorithms.
The CBO Show Your Work Act of 2017 has 14 co-sponsors including, Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jim Inhofe (R-OK),  Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), David Perdue (R-GA), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement Thursday in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act released by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX):
“We appreciate the hard work and countless hours our colleagues in the House have put into crafting this legislation. As we’ve long said, tax reform should be about making the code more pro-growth and pro-family. The House bill is an important step in the process.”
“The best way to provide real relief to working families is through a straightforward, significant, and permanent expansion of the child tax credit. We wish the House draft had done more on this front – preferably doubling the credit to $2,000 per child and expanding its applicability to payroll taxes. We look forward to working with our colleagues to make sure working families are moved to the front of the line in the Senate bill.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Smarter Sentencing Act
Date: October 5, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators led by Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) reintroduced the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2017. This legislation would modernize federal drug sentencing policies by giving federal judges more discretion in sentencing those convicted of non-violent drug offenses. Senators Lee and Durbin were joined in this effort by Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Al Franken (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tom Udall (D-NM), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Angus King (I-ME), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM).
“Our current federal sentencing laws are out of date, they are often counterproductive, and in far too many cases they are unjust,” said Senator Lee. “The Smarter Sentencing Act is a commonsense solution that will greatly reduce the financial and, more importantly, the human cost imposed on society by the broken status quo. The SSA will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to their families and communities.”
Speaking of criminal justice reform generally, Senator Lee said, “over the past week, I’ve introduced or cosponsored three criminal justice reform bills—the Smarter Sentencing Act, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, and the Mens Rea Reform Act. I would proudly vote for these bills, individually or with one or more of them packaged together, because I think reforming our criminal justice system is a moral and policy imperative. Any step forward will make a real difference. I look forward to continuing to work on these bills and on criminal justice reform issues more broadly, which will always remain a priority for me.”
The United States has seen a 500 percent increase in the number of inmates in federal custody since 1980, and almost 50 percent of those federal inmates are serving sentences for drug offenses. Mandatory sentences, particularly drug sentences, can force a judge to impose a one-size-fits-all sentence without taking into account the details of an individual case. Many of these sentences have disproportionately affected minority populations and helped foster distrust of the criminal justice system.
This large increase in the prison population has put a strain on our prison infrastructure and federal budgets. The Bureau of Prisons is 16 percent over capacity and this severe overcrowding puts both inmates and guards at risk. This focus on incarceration is also diverting increasingly limited funds from law enforcement and crime prevention to housing federal inmates, the cost of which has increased by more than 1100 percent. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementation of these reforms would save taxpayers approximately $3 billion over ten years.

Title: Senators Hatch, Lee, Cruz, Perdue, and Paul Introduce Bill to Strength Criminal Intent Protections
Date: October 2, 2017

Content:
Washington, D.C.—Today, Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), David Perdue (R-GA), and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced legislation to strengthen criminal intent protections in federal law. Their bill, the Mens Rea Reform Act of 2017, would set a default intent standard for all criminal laws and regulations that lack such a standard. This legislation would ensure that courts and creative prosecutors do not take the absence of a criminal intent standard to mean that the government can obtain a conviction without any proof a guilty mind.
Senator Hatch will deliver a speech on the Senate floor about the need for mens rea reform at 3:30 p.m. EDT. Follow the speech live here.
“Rampant and unfair overcriminalization in America calls for criminal justice reform, which starts with default mens rea legislation,” Sen. Hatch said. “Requiring proof of criminal intent protects individuals from prison time or other criminal penalties for accidental conduct or for activities they didn’t know were wrong. In recent years, Congress and federal agencies have increasingly created crimes with vague or unclear criminal intent requirements or with no criminal intent requirement at all. The Mens Rea Reform Act will help correct that problem and ensure that honest, hardworking Americans are not swept up in the criminal justice system for doing things they didn’t know were against the law.”
“Prosecutors should have to show a suspect had a guilty mind, not just that they committed an illegal act, before an American is put behind bars,” Sen. Lee said. “Unfortunately our federal laws contain far too many provisions that do not require prosecutors to prove a defendant intended to commit a crime. The result is criminal justice system that over penalizes innocent acts which only undermines the rule of law."
“I’m proud to join Sen. Hatch in addressing one of the biggest flaws in our modern criminal justice system,” Sen. Cruz said. “Currently, the federal government can send men and women to prison without demonstrating criminal intent. As Congress works to address criminal justice reform, the Mens Rea Reform Act needs to be enacted to protect the rights of all Americans.”
Statements of Support
John Malcolm, Vice President for the Institute for Constitutional Government and Director of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, Heritage Foundation:
Senator Hatch deserves a lot credit for keeping the issue of mens rea reform on the front burner.  Mens rea reform is a matter of fundamental fairness.  By having adequate mens rea standards, we ensure that moral blameworthiness is front and center in our criminal justice system.  The intent of the actor should make a difference in whether he is criminally prosecuted or is dealt with through the civil or administrative justice systems.  We should not be so cavalier about labeling someone a criminal, with all of the collateral consequences that flow from that, when someone does something unwittingly that causes harm.  Restoring moral blameworthiness to greater prominence in our criminal laws will revitalize our criminal justice system and preserve its moral authority, which, in turn, will engender respect for the rule of law.
Norman L. Reimer, Executive Director, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL):
NACDL lauds this important solution among several solutions that it actively supports to help address the fundamental imbalances and the destructive consequences of this country’s criminal justice system. Its members urge Congress to support Senator Hatch’s continued commitment to this fundamental principle of fairness.
David Patton, Executive Director and Attorney-in-Chief, Federal Defenders of New York, Inc.:
As Federal Defenders, we are acutely aware of the need for mens rea reform. Over 80 percent of people charged with federal crimes are too poor to afford a lawyer, and nearly 80 percent of people charged with federal crimes are Black, Hispanic, or Native American. These are our clients, and too many of them are subject to laws that are neither fair nor consistent with traditional principles of criminal liability. This bill would help to remedy some of those failings.
Efforts to reform mens rea intent requirements for federal criminal statutes are supported by the US Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Foundation, Koch Industries, and many others.

Title: Sens. Lee and Rubio: Families Must Come First for Tax Relief
Date: September 27, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement today in response to tax plan released by the White House:
“It is clear from the release of the Big Six framework today that an enhanced child tax credit remains the best way to provide meaningful tax relief for working American families. We are very encouraged by the plan’s priority for a “significantly increased” child credit as its vehicle for this relief, and applaud the tax writers for this choice.
“Given the fundamental reforms of the framework, the child credit must be at least doubled in order to ensure working families get real tax relief. The child credit should also be applied to payroll tax liability in order to cut the taxes that working class families pay.
“Tax reform should focus on addressing the present-day challenges facing working families. We look forward to working with the Administration and tax writing committees to ensure that these families are first in line for tax relief.”

Title: Utah Senators Introduce Native Species Protection Act
Date: September 26, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the Native Species Protection Act today, a bill that would allow states to manage species that exist entirely within their border.
“There are real environmental benefits to protecting endangered species from extinction, but the federal law intended to establish such protections – the Endangered Species Act – is in serious need of reform,” said Senator Lee. “In the nearly fifty years since it was signed into law, the ESA has done more to impede economic activity, obstruct local conservation efforts, and give federal bureaucrats regulatory control over private property, than it has done to protect endangered species. The Native Species Protection Act is a commonsense reform that would limit the damage caused by federal mismanagement of protected species while empowering state and local officials to pursue sensible conservation plans with their communities.”
“I am grateful to join my colleagues in introducing the Native Species Protection Act, which empowers states to manage wildlife populations unique to their state,” said Hatch. “Time and again, we have witnessed federal mismanagement of numerous species, especially in my home state of Utah. In my view, state officials—not Beltway bureaucrats—are best equipped to manage animal populations in a responsible manner, especially those populations that fall exclusively within their borders. This legislation authorizes state wildlife management authorities, in cooperation with local communities, to develop balanced conservation plans that meet the needs of state-specific species and affected areas. I’m pleased to be a part of this effort and hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this commonsense legislation."
The Native Species Protection Act clarifies that noncommercial species found entirely within the borders of a single State are not subject to regulation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 or any other provision of law enacted as an exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.

Title: Sens. Lee and Wyden Seek Answers to Surveillance Targeting
Date: September 26, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence Director Dan Coates today seeking clarity on which individuals the intelligence community is targeting under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act.
“As you know, later this year, Congress will consider the reauthorization of Section 702, which authorizes the collections, use, and dissemination of electronic communications content either stored by U.S. internet service providers or traveling across the internet’s backbone,” the letter reads. “Unlike traditional FISA surveillance, which requires individualized warrants, surveillance under Section 702 merely requires that the FISA Court approve broad categories of foreign intelligence information to be collected as well as the targeting and minimization procedures the government intends to employ.”
“As Congress considers reauthorization of this authority,” the letter continues, “we believe it is important that Congress and the American people have a better understanding of the general categories of individuals who can be targeted, particularly given that intelligence community leaders have repeatedly described Section 702 as a tool to target foreigners who threaten our national security.”
The letter requests Director Coats to “clarify the types of individuals and organizations that the intelligence community currently targets under Section 702” by October 25, 2017.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces “CBO Show Your Work” Bill
Date: August 4, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the “CBO Show Your Work” Act Thursday, legislation designed to improve the legislative process by making the Congressional Budget Office more transparent and accountable.
“Congress does need a scorekeeper to provide budgetary estimates for the policy changes it considers,” Sen. Lee said. “But at a bare minimum, that scorekeeper should be forced to show how its models work. Currently the CBO doesn’t have to do that.”
“That is why I have introduced the CBO Show Your Work Act of 2017,” Lee continued. “This bill would require the CBO to publish its data, models, and all details of computation used in its cost analysis and scoring. CBO would keep its role as official scorekeeper of congressional budget proposals – but now the American people and the economic community would be able to see what’s going on in all those spreadsheets and algorithms.”
The CBO Show Your Work Act of 2017 has 14 co-sponsors including, Sens.

Title: Sens. Lee, Cruz, Sasse, and Rep. Issa Introduce Occupational Licensing Reform Bill
Date: July 27, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ben Sasse (R-NE), as well as Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) introduced the Restoring Board Immunity Act Thursday, a bill designed to help states reform their occupational licensing regulations.
“Occupational licensing costs consumers $200 billion in higher costs every year and deprives an estimated three million prospective professionals of job opportunities,” Sen. Lee said. “This bill creates an incentive for states to implement much needed occupational licensing reforms.”
"Occupational licensing schemes are one of the worst expressions of special interests stifling the American dream for hardworking men and women across this country,” Sen. Cruz said. “The government should not be unnecessarily denying people the opportunity to earn an honest living. This bill incentivizes states to roll back and reform job-killing regulations, and create better paying jobs and greater opportunity.”
"If we want to help our neighbors find work and fight poverty, we can start by clearing away unnecessary occupational licensing barriers,” said Sasse. “Men and women who want to serve their communities and provide for their kids shouldn’t have to wander through the complicated maze of complicated licensing requirements."
“Today roughly one in three American workers is required to obtain some sort of occupational license, often requiring hundreds in fees and months in training just to be able to do their job,” said Congressman Darrell Issa. “While many licenses are to ensure safety, these requirements are often for jobs no more risky than braiding hair, dog-watching, or flower arranging. These overly burdensome requirements have become an often-overlooked inhibitor of economic growth and made it difficult for honest Americans to get ahead. This bill makes long-overdue reforms that will encourage states make changes in order to create jobs and promote opportunity for all.”
For some professions, like pilots and dentists, government sanctioned licensing requirements are necessary for public safety. But there is no reason a license is needed to decorate a room or braid someone’s hair. Unfortunately, far too many professions are now closed off to new entrants because of onerous licensing requirements.
The Federal Trade Commission has been fighting some of these laws on antitrust grounds and in 2015 the Supreme Court’s decision in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC created significant uncertainty regarding the legality of state occupational licensing boards across the country.
This bill would both provide state occupational licensing boards the antitrust protection they need to continue operating, so long as the state enact certain occupational licensing reforms designed to protect consumers and prospective professionals.

Title: Sens. Lee and Leahy Introduce ECPA Modernization Act
Date: July 27, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the ECPA Modernization Act Thursday, a bill that would update federal statutes to better reflect Americans’ modern expectations of privacy.
“Americans don’t believe the federal government should have warrantless access to their emails just because they are 180 days old,” Sen. Lee said. “They don’t believe the government should be able to always know where you are just because you are carrying a cell phone. It is long past time that Congress updated our federal laws to better protect Americans’ privacy.”
“Our digital privacy laws are woefully out of date and make no sense in the modern world,” Sen. Leahy said. “Americans expect and deserve strong, meaningful protections for their emails, texts, photos, location information and documents stored in the cloud. It’s time for Congress to enact broad reforms to ECPA and other privacy laws to bring these laws into the 21st Century.”

WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Dean Heller (R-NV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Steve Daines (R-MT), Cory Gardner (R-CO), and Al Franken (D-MN) introduced the Email Privacy Act Thursday, a bill that would update federal privacy law for email retention.
“The Electronic Communications Protect Act was written 30 years ago before the widespread use of email,” Sen. Lee said. “Americans now expect that their email communications will have the same privacy protections as their written communications. This bill would provide that common sense protection.”
The Email Privacy Act would require law enforcement to go before a judge and get a search warrant based on probable cause whenever it seeks to obtain our emails, photos, or texts held by technology companies. This bipartisan bill updates the 1986 Electronic Communications Protect Act (ECPA), which currently allows the government to take your private information from third parties if that information is older than 180 days.

Pioneer Day is celebrated by Utahns and many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) as the day in 1847 when LDS pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley under the leadership of Brigham Young.

Title: Sens. Lee, Leahy, Hoeven, Cruz Introduce Congressional Clerkship Act
Date: July 20, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act, a bill that would improve the business of Congress and increase the public’s understanding of its work by establishing a structured congressional clerkship program for recent law school graduates and young lawyers.
“Unlike the Executive and Judicial branches, Congress currently lacks a structured program for recruiting and hiring recent law school graduates,” Sen. Lee said. “Too often this means that new attorneys, who are otherwise qualified and eager to work for Congress, do not even consider a congressional career and are instead pursuing other opportunities.”
“A clerkship can provide invaluable experience to a young lawyer at the start of his or her career,” Sen. Leahy said. “The federal judiciary has long had a clerkship program that teaches recent law school graduates the workings of the judicial branch. Yet there has never been a formal clerkship program in Congress. Creating a pathway for more young lawyers to gain an understanding of how Congress works and the value of public service will lead to a greater embrace of public service. I am proud to be introducing once again bipartisan legislation to encourage more young lawyers to work in the Congress.”
“Providing recent law graduates with a clerkship in the Senate or the House will help us attract some of the nation’s best and brightest to public service,” Sen. Hoeven said. “The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act will create a formal program to involve new lawyers in the work of Congress and provide an opportunity for them to see firsthand representative democracy at work.”
“For many years, the brightest young minds coming out of law school have flocked to the federal courts and the executive branch for clerkships and fellowships,” Sen. Cruz said. “Unsurprisingly, this has contributed to the legal profession’s excessive focus on litigation and bureaucratic regulation, at the expense of legislative knowledge and development. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act is a small, yet important step in the fight to change that trend. Ideally, the Act will better position Congress to obtain top-notch services from stellar law school graduates, and it will give those graduates access to—and a much better understanding of—the legislative process.”
Committees in the Senate and the House will be responsible to select at least six clerks each year to perform a one-year clerkship. These committees would oversee the selection process in order to guarantee fair allotment between the majority and minority party offices.
“Senators Lee, Leahy, Hoeven, and Cruz are to be applauded for their vision in championing this bipartisan legislation,” said the Coalition’s Steering Committee, comprised of Larry Kramer, former Dean of Stanford Law School; Robin West, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center; Bill Treanor, Dean of Georgetown University Law Center; Abbe Gluck, law professor at Yale Law School; and Dakota Rudesill, law professor at Ohio State.
“The problem is not that Congress does not have enough lawyers,” the Steering Committee noted. “Rather, the problem is that Congress is not competitive for the opportunity to apprentice lawyers on the fast track to the legal profession’s most influential ranks. Congress is missing the opportunity to shape the constitutional perspective of the law’s future leaders. That is because unlike the federal courts, federal agencies, law firms, and law schools, Congress lacks a regularized apprenticeship program that is readily accessible to any top new law graduate, on the basis of objective qualifications,” the Coalition’s Steering Committee emphasized.
This bill is named after Daniel Webster, who is considered one of the most admired and distinguished lawyers and legislators to ever serve in Congress.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces National Labor Relations Board Reform Bill
Date: July 20, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced legislation that would strip the National Labor Relations Board of its power to prosecute and adjudicate labor disputes.
The “Protecting American Jobs Act” would transfer the power to hear labor disputes to federal courts. The NLRB would retain the power to conduct investigations, but would not be allowed to prosecute them.
“For far too long the NLRB has acted as judge, jury, and executioner, for labor disputes in this country,” Sen. Lee said. “The havoc they have wrought by upsetting decades of established labor law has cost countless jobs. This common sense legislation would finally restore fairness and accountability to our nation’s labor laws."
The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), James Lankford (R-OK), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Luther Strange (R-AL), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).

Title: Sen. Lee Responds to New DOJ Asset Forfeiture Policy
Date: July 19, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday regarding the Department of Justice’s new asset forfeiture policy:
“Back in May I encouraged the Department of Justice to review its policies on civil asset forfeiture in light of increasing indications from the Supreme Court that this practice is constitutionally suspect,” Sen. Lee said. “Instead of revising forfeiture practices in a manner to better protect Americans’ due process rights, the DOJ seems determined to lose in court before it changes its policies for the better.”?
On May 31, Senator Lee, along with Senators Paul, Crapo, Udall, Heinrich, and King
wrote to the Department of Justice
regarding civil asset forfeiture. The letter read, in part, that DOJ “need not wait for Supreme Court censure before reforming [civil asset forfeiture] practices” and encouraging DOJ “to revise its civil asset forfeiture practices to reflect our nation’s commitment to the rule of law and due process.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Gosar and Colleagues Send Letter Asking Sec. Carson to Rescind Zoning Rule
Date: July 14, 2017

WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Gosar (R-AZ) joined a letter with twelve Senate and six House colleagues in asking Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson to rescind the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Final Rule in an effort to empower local communities to tackle their own unique zoning challenges. The letter reads, in part:
“We stand with you in opposing any and all instances of discrimination, but this rule does not actually help in that effort. Instead, it would extend reach of the federal government beyond its authority and could take away state and local governments’ ability to make local zoning decisions.”
The letter continues, “Moving forward, we respectfully ask that you use your authority to rescind the AFFH rule in its entirety. It is critical that we pursue real, sensible reforms to reduce poverty and improve the opportunities available to lower-income citizens at the local level. We look forward to partnering with you to ensure justice and opportunity are preserved in every neighborhood across our great land.”
Sen. Lee and Rep. Gosar are joined on the letter by Sens. Richard Shelby (R-AL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), M. Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), James Lankford (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), James Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Thune (R-SD) and Reps.

Title: Sens. Lee and Crapo Introduce the Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing Act
Date: June 29, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) introduced the Silencers Helping Us Save Hearing Act of 2017, Thursday, a bill that would ensure the elimination of all federal regulations of suppressors.
“Suppressors can make shooting safer for the millions of hunters and sportsmen that exercise their constitutional right to use firearms every year,” Sen. Lee said. “The current process for obtaining a suppressor is far too expensive and burdensome. Our bill would remove these unnecessary federal regulations and make it easier for firearms users to protect themselves.
“By properly classifying suppressors as a firearm accessory, our bill would allow sportsmen to have better access to hearing protection and preserve the hearing of sportsmen, gun owners and those who live near shooting ranges,” Sen. Crapo said.

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on Delayed Healthcare Vote
Date: June 27, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Wednesday after a procedural vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act was delayed:
“The first draft of the bill included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the affluent, bailouts for insurance companies, and subsidies for lower-income Americans. But it ignored the middle-class families who have borne the brunt of Obamacare, and who have been left behind by both parties in Washington for too long. That’s why I opposed it. And it’s why I’m happy we postponed the vote today.”
“Republicans have an opportunity now to remember those forgotten Americans. We can rewrite our bill to bring down the price working families pay for health insurance - while still protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions. I look forward to working with my colleagues, and President Trump, to finally stand up and deliver for the middle class.”

Title: Sen. Lee, Rep. Stewart Urge Pres. Trump to Consider North Korean Government Involvement in David Sneddon Disappearance
Date: June 26, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) sent a letter to President Trump in preparation for this week’s summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in regarding the disappearance of BYU student David Louis Sneddon from China in 2004. The letter urges the President to consider the possibility that the North Korean government was responsible for David’s disappearance. Lee and Stewart cite reports from regional experts to support that possibility.
The letter reads in part, “The tragic death of Otto Wambier last week illustrates the continued danger that North Korea poses to Americans in the region as its government tries to gain an asymmetric advantage and diplomatic leverage over the United States and our allies. North Korean leaders should be held accountable for this deplorable crime and deterred from harming Americans citizens in the future, including harm to the three we know to be in captivity now.”
Resolutions from Congressman Stewart and Senator Lee calling on the State Department and intelligence community to work together with regional allies on continued investigation into David’s case passed the House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year.

“I commend Secretary Zinke for producing a balanced and factual report that should be seen by both sides as genuine progress towards a consensus solution to land use issues in San Juan County. The report confirms that President Obama abused the Antiquities Act by not limiting his monument designation to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of cultural artifacts and areas of importance. I look forward to working with all stakeholders to come up with a legislative solution that addresses the concerns raised by Secretary Zinke.”

Title: Sens. Send Bipartisan Letter Questioning DOJ Sentencing Policy

WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Rand Paul (R-KY) sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday, seeking answers about the Department of Justice’s May 10, 2017 memorandum, directing federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious offense possible when prosecuting defendants.
“The Department’s policy is based on the premise that ‘[i]t is of the utmost importance to enforce the law fairly and consistently.’ We agree. The problem is that, in many cases, current law requires nonviolent first-time offenders to receive longer sentences than violent criminals. Sentences of this kind not only ‘[undermine] respect for our legal system,’ but ruin families and have a corrosive effect on communities.”
The letter asks six specific questions about the Department’s policy change and requests answers to those questions within 30 days.

Title: Sen. Lee Applauds Pres. Trump’s Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement
Date: May 31, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) applauded the decision of the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and protect the economic and energy sovereignty of the United States. "The American people did not vote for President Trump so that American taxpayers could send billions of dollars overseas to establish a global crony capitalist slush fund. Pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement is absolutely the right decision for the United States economy.”
Sen. Lee continued, “This agreement was negotiated intentionally by the Obama administration to circumvent the Senate’s power to advise and consent on international treaties because they understood it was too unpopular and damaging to U.S interests to ratify. The decision to withdraw will afford Americans greater economic opportunity and cheaper, more flexible energy choices in the future. I look forward to working with President Trump, my Congressional colleagues, states, and local governments to follow-up this decision with additional energy policy reforms that benefit the American people like repealing harmful regulations and reducing federal barriers to energy production.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined with 18 colleagues in sending a letter to State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) requesting that language be included in the FY2018 Appropriations bill to protect human life in U.S. global health assistance and prohibit funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).  President Trump and Secretary Tillerson have already taken important steps to address these issues, but Congress must now act to support and codify such standards.
“Your long standing commitment to pro-life policies during your chairmanship of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs has been greatly appreciated, and we urge you to include language codifying the important pro-life actions that President Trump has taken on foreign assistance as you draft the FY18 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill,” the letter reads.

Title: Sens. Lee, Feinstein Introduce Due Process Guarantee Act
Date: May 24, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Chris Coons (D-DE), introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act Wednesday, a bill to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely, without charge or trial.
“We must not betray our country’s most sacred values by making a false choice between civil liberties and national security,” Feinstein said. “No person should be detained indefinitely without charge our trial, and this bill is a step toward making that clear in the law. We have demonstrated time and again that the federal court system is perfectly capable of handling terrorists.”
“America should never waver in vigilantly pursuing those who would commit, or plot to commit, acts of treason against our country,” Lee said. “But the federal government should not be allowed to indefinitely imprison any American on the mere accusation of treason without affording them the due process guaranteed by our Constitution. By forbidding the government from detaining Americans without trial absent explicit congressional approval, the Due Process Guarantee Act strikes the right balance between protecting our security and the civil liberties of each citizen.”
In recent years, some have argued that the indefinite detention of Americans is permissible under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Due Process Guarantee Act clarifies that the AUMF and other general authorizations cannot be construed as acts of Congress that permit indefinite detention and codifies the “clear statement rule” to clarify that indefinite detention can only occur if Congress expressly authorizes it.
The bill also expands the Non-Detention Act of 1971 to include green card holders in addition to citizens.

Title: Senators Applaud Pres. Trump’s Executive Order on National Monument Review
Date: May 19, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Lee (R-UT) and 25 of his Senate colleagues sent a letter to President Trump supporting his April 26th Executive Order calling for a review of national monuments created under the 1906 Antiquities Act. The letter reads in part:
“Land use decisions are never easy as they directly affect neighborhoods, their citizens’ livelihoods, environments, and the economic future of communities. They can upend local economies or promote significant growth; they can limit recreational access or ensure widespread sustainable enjoyment of the land. These policies can protect the environment, support effective land management, and safeguard native land use. The complexity and lasting effect of these decisions is why they are best made collaboratively, through local consultation. Yet, the Antiquities Act requires no such coordination prior to the creation of a national monument. The broad discretion the Antiquities Act grants presidents has led to its abuse.
“No president has seriously revisited the modern, expansive use of the Antiquities Act. We urge you to keep all remedies on the table as you consider how to correct past abuses of the Antiquities Act and work with Congress to ensure a more measured approach is taken and required in the future.”
The letter was signed by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), James Lankford (R-OK), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Luther Strange (R-AL), Steve Daines (R-MT), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), John Barrasso (R-WY), James Risch (R-ID), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Dean Heller (R-NV), John Kennedy (R-LA), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Michael Enzi (R-WY), and James Inhofe (R-OK).

Title: Sen. Lee Commends FCC Announcement on Internet Innovation
Date: May 18, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday after the Federal Communications Commission voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom notice of proposed rulemaking:
“I commend the FCC for taking the first step in returning the Internet to the state of permissionless innovation it thrived under until just two short years ago. Today’s action begins the process of undoing the agency’s 2015 Open Internet Order, which upended the decades-old bipartisan consensus that consumers – not government regulators – should control the information superhighway.”
“But today’s FCC action is only the first step in protecting Internet innovation. A stable regulatory environment can only come from congressional action. This is why I recently introduced the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would not only repeal the 2015 Order but also prevent the FCC from further action without congressional mandate.”
“I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, House, and FCC, to further promote competition by removing other existing barriers to entry. Only competition – among Internet Service Providers, apps, platforms, content creators, and all other firms across the Internet – can ensure that consumers, not the government, pick winners and losers who provide the best services at the lowest prices.”

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to President Trump Friday, requesting answers about possible strategic and operational changes to America’s longest conflict.
“From 2006 to 2014 the United States had over 20,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan at any given time, with 100,000 military personnel in the country between 2010 and 2011,” the one of the five questions asked in the letter reads. “However, these levels of military activity did not yield the long-term stability or security gains that were desired. How would an increase in the level of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and new strategy achieve a different outcome at this time?”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Restoring Internet Freedom Act
Date: May 1, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Restoring Internet Freedom Act Monday, a bill that would nullify the Federal Communications Commission’s 2015 Open Internet Order and prohibit the FCC from issuing a similar rule in the future. The bill is cosponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Rand Paul (R-KY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and James Inhofe (R-OK).
“Few areas of our economy have been as dynamic and innovative as the internet,” Sen. Lee said. “This is largely because the federal government has taken a hands-off approach that has allowed permissionless innovation to deliver unthinkable technological advances in such a short amount of time. But now this engine of growth is threatened by the Federal Communications Commission’s 2015 Open Internet Order, which would put federal bureaucrats in charge of engineering the Internet’s infrastructure. That is why I am introducing the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would nullify Open Internet Order and prohibit the FCC from issuing a similar rule in the future.”
"Two and a half years ago, I said that net neutrality was 'Obamacare for the Internet,’” said Sen. Cruz. "At the time, the Obama administration, in its typically deceptive manner, had conflated net neutrality — a worthy idea, as originally defined, to protect an open internet — with reclassifying the internet as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, a burdensome, behemoth of a law that gives all sorts of authority to the government to regulate pricing and terms of service and stifle innovation online. My comments were intended to raise awareness of this unprecedented government power grab, which the Obama administration and its friends at the FCC were attempting to quietly accomplish. I am proud to work with my friend Mike Lee on the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, a bill that rolls back former President Obama's power grab, protects open internet principles, and recognizes the transformative effect that the internet has had on our lives, generating billions of dollars of new economic activity and millions of jobs, largely free of government’s heavy hand. We must preserve a free and open internet, and give stability to the companies and users operating within the internet ecosystem."
“This bill is another important step to roll back harmful Obama-era regulations that stifle innovation and delay broadband deployment in Wisconsin and throughout America,” Sen. Johnson said. “The FCC has taken encouraging steps to address this overreach, and the Restoring Internet Freedom Act would help ensure that the Internet remains open and free of heavy-handed federal regulations.”
“Putting a stop to the FCC and the Obama administration’s unauthorized power grab over the Internet is an important step toward ensuring continued technological innovation,” Sen. Paul said. "The Internet and web-based commerce have flourished over the past twenty years, spurring growth in the American economy. Getting big government and bureaucrats out of the way of that growth will benefit all Americans.”
“This legislation is a step in the right direction as Congress works to ensure internet regulation does not stifle innovation,” Sen. Inhofe said. I appreciate the steps FCC Chairman Pai has already taken to roll back the 2015 Order which undercut future investment by curbing innovation and creativity and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this issue.”

Title: Sen. Lee Calls for Vote on Military Humanitarian Operations Act
Date: April 11, 2017

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement calling for Congress to take up S. 409, the Military Humanitarian Operations Act which he and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced earlier this year:
"Since the U.S. cruise missile strikes against the Shayrat Air Base in Syria last week, President Trump and several senior administration officials have indicated that the United States may be prompted to act again in retaliation to other attacks against civilians or for broader humanitarian purposes.
We are all angered by the pictures and stories from Syria in recent years, and the desire to retaliate for these unfathomable attacks is understandable. However, over the past 200 years, the separate and distinct roles of the executive and the legislative branches to declare war, launch military attacks, and defend against or retaliate for an attack against the United States have become blurred.
To help clarify and ensure that military force is used appropriately, Senator Rand Paul and I introduced S. 409, the Military Humanitarian Operations Act. It states any military operations conducted to fulfill a humanitarian purpose where hostilities are anticipated must be authorized by Congress.
While such operations and interventions are well intentioned, recent history has shown they are often risky and may result in unintended consequences that are detrimental to our national security. They should only be undertaken after serious consideration and approval by the elected representatives of the American people, ensuring that public accountability on war-making decisions exists.
In light of the developments over the past week, I call on the Senate to take up and pass S. 409 and for President Trump to work with Congress to achieve consensus on national security policies as called for in the Constitution.”

“President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) voted to bring Judge Neal Gorsuch’s nomination to the Senate floor Monday. During his remarks, Senator Lee reflected on Judge Gorsuch’s many qualifications as well as the role of Justices on the Supreme Court.
“I wonder how a judge that many are decrying as so wildly out of the mainstream that he can't become confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States could have seen 2,700 cases in his time on the 10th District Court and have ruled in unanimity with his colleagues 97% of the time,” Sen. Lee stated. “In 99% of the cases he was in the majority. That is not the background of a judge who is not in the mainstream.”
Sen. Lee continued, “At the end of the day, it is difficult to imagine a judge who is more well-prepared, more well-credentialed, or more well-suited as a matter of judicial interpretation, of statutory construction, or as a matter of judicial temperament. I am honored to support the confirmation of judge Gorsuch and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Booker Introduce Commodity Check Off Reform Bill
Date: March 28, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017 (OFF Act) Tuesday, a measure intended to bring much needed transparency and accountability to the federal government’s commodity check off programs.
Checkoff programs are mandatory participation programs under the US Department of Agriculture. These programs are funded through compulsory fees on producers of eggs, beef, pork and a multitude of other agricultural products. The programs and associated boards have received criticism in the past for a lack of transparency, apparent conflicts of interest, misuse of their funding and anticompetitive behavior.
“A recent FOIA request uncovered some troubling emails between the American Egg Board and top executives in the egg industry,” Lee said. “This was a classic case of Big Government and Big Business working together to squeeze out smaller rivals and squelch innovation.”
The American Egg Board CEO at the center of those emails has since resigned, but questions remain about the board’s activities.
“This bipartisan legislation will bring much needed reforms to federal checkoff programs,” Senator Booker said. “By cracking down on conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices, and bringing additional oversight and transparency, this bill will help to level the playing field for small family farmers and entrepreneurs.”
This bill is a direct response to the egg board scandal and past checkoff program misconduct, and the changes proposed by this legislation are designed to improve checkoff board behavior and avoid similar conduct in the future.
A companion bill cosponsored by Reps. Dave Brat (R-VA) and Dina Titus (D-NV) has been introduced in the House.
To improve the practices of checkoff programs, the Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017would:
Clarify and fortify the prohibition on checkoff programs from contracting with organizations that lobby on agricultural policy
Establishes program standards that prohibit anticompetitive behavior and engaging in activities that may involve a conflict of interest
Requires transparency through publication of checkoff program budgets and expenditures, and means for audits of compliance

“We will begin working collaboratively here in the Senate and with our friends in the House to produce a bill that will get 51 votes in the Senate and 216 in the House. The bill will reduce costs, save taxpayers money, and make our health care system great again.”
“The reality is that the current House bill was not ready for the House floor and certainly not ready for the Senate. We need an open, transparent, and deliberate process. The stakes for all Americans are simply too high for anything else.”

Title: Sen. Lee Renews Call to Find Utahn Missing in Asia
Date: March 23, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) joined with seven Senate colleagues Thursday to reintroduce a Senate Resolution on the disappearance of BYU student David Louis Sneddon in China in 2004. An identical resolution unanimously passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December, and a similar resolution introduced by Congressman Chris Stewart was adopted in the House of Representatives last year.
David Sneddon went missing while traveling in the Yunnan Province of China in August of 2004. Since that time, his family and the Utah and Nebraska delegations in Congress have worked diligently with the State Department to uncover more information about his disappearance and possible whereabouts. Recent reports from regional experts indicate a possibility that the North Korean government - known for decades to have kidnapped foreign nationals in Asia for their own intelligence and military purposes - could have been involved in David’s case and potential captivity. Sen. Lee spoke on the Senate floor last year about this issue in more detail.
Click here for full text.
The resolution calls upon the State Department to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts in Asia and work closely with U.S. intelligence agencies to continue the investigation into David’s disappearance. Sen. Lee hopes that President Trump and Secretary Tillerson will prioritize this issue as they formulate administration policy for the Asia-Pacific region.

Title: Sen. Lee Opposes House Health Care Bill
Date: March 22, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday after reviewing the latest version of the American Health Care Act:
“I promised the people of Utah I would do everything I can to repeal Obamacare.” Lee said. “The American Health Care Act fails to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with an alternative that lowers costs. Additionally, its reforms to Medicaid fail to either incentivize state innovation or place the program on a financially sustainable path. I am a no,” Lee continued.
“There is a lot of miscommunication out there about what can and cannot be done under the Senate’s Byrd Rule,” Lee added. “I recently discussed ideas and proposals with the Senate parliamentarian and she has not yet ruled on whether Obamacare’s regulations may or may not be repealed in the reconciliation process. It is also unclear whether any of the life protections in the House bill will make it through the process.”
“All of this suggests we should slow down this effort to get replace right.”

Title: Sen. Lee Praises Trump’s Budget

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Lee (R-UT) released the following statement regarding the Trump Administration’s budget:
“President Trump’s budget is a solid step towards addressing the gross over-spending that is driving our national debt,” Lee said. "Many of the programs eliminated by Trump’s budget can and should be financed by state and local entities, and Trump should be commended for making some of the tough calls necessary to move our country in a direction of solvency, with the principle of federalism in mind."
Also,” Lee continued, “while our intentions abroad are oftentimes noble, it is important to remember that we have many pressing needs at home. We should prioritize spending that will address these domestic needs, thus fulfilling our promise to put Americans first again. The defense of our nation, on the other hand, is one of the few constitutional spending obligations we have, and we should continue to proceed with these budgets carefully and prudently.”
Senator Lee looks forward to working with his congressional colleagues to craft and pass a balanced, fiscally sound budget in the coming months, ending our country’s habit of kicking the can down the road and governing through continuing resolutions.

Title: Sen. Lee Fights to Repeal Costly and Useless NOX Rule
Date: March 14, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) introduced a resolution pursuant to the Congressional Review Act Tuesday that will repeal a costly and ineffective Environmental Protection Agency regulation targeting the Huntington and Hunter power plants in Utah. The resolution of disapproval was introduced by the entire Utah Delegation.
“The great state of Utah already has proposed a perfectly safe and effective nitrogen oxide regulation regime,” Sen. Lee said. “The EPA’s costly new regulations would add hundreds of millions to the power bills of working families and all for an imperceptible change in visibility.”
Utah submitted a nitrogen oxide state implementation plan compliant with the Clean Air Act but it was rejected by the EPA last year. Instead, the EPA is trying to implement a federal implementation plan that would require the Huntington and Hunter coal-fired power plants to install $700 million in new equipment and add $150 million to the plants operating costs. By EPA’s own estimates, implementation of the FIP will result in 5-10% rate increases.
The EPA issued its new nitrogen oxide regulation pursuant to the Regional Haze Program of the Clean Air Act, which was passed to improve visibility at certain natural areas like Arches and Canyonlands National Park.
But the regulation the EPA issued would only improve visibility by just 0.14 deciviews compared to Utah’s regulation plan. For reference, 1 deciview is the minimum change perceptible to the human eye.

Title: GOP Senators Call on Sec. Tillerson to Investigate State Department Meddling
Date: March 14, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON  - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and a group of Senators called on Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson today to immediately investigate how US funds are being used by the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to support left-of-center political groups and impress left-leaning policies on sovereign nations, regardless of their desire for self-determination. One such group is USAID multi-grant recipient, the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations. Sen. Lee and his colleagues believe this behavior is unacceptable and must be halted immediately.
Sens. Inhofe (R-OK), Tillis (R-NC), Cruz (R-TX), Perdue (R-GA), and Cassidy (R-LA) join in signing the letter.
“Over the past few months, elected officials and political leaders of foreign nations have been coming to me with disappointing news and reports of US activity in their respective countries. This includes reports of diplomats playing political favorites, USAID funds supporting extreme and sometimes violent political activists, and the US Government working to marginalize the moderates and conservatives in leadership roles,” Sen. Lee said. “This sort of political favoritism from our missions around the world is unacceptable and endangers our bilateral relationships.”
The letter calls on Secretary Tillerson to, “…investigate all funds associated with promoting democracy and governance and review the programs, accounts, and multiplicity of US entities involved in such activities. We must … review how all our tax dollars are being utilized in order to halt activities that are fomenting political unrest, disrespecting national sovereignty and civil society, and ultimately undermine our attempts to build beneficial international relationships.”
The most damaging consequence of the United States weighing in so heavily on one side of the political spectrum abroad is that we ostracize many foreign citizens who have traditionally supported strong relations with the United States. Such division allows aggressive opportunists like Russia space to operate and cause further damage.
Sen. Lee is hopeful Secretary Tillerson acts quickly on this issue and looks forward to continuing to work with him in the future.

Title: Lee Statement on American Health Care Act
Date: March 7, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday in response to the release of the American Health Care Act:
“This is not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for. It is a missed opportunity and a step in the wrong direction,” Sen. Lee said.
“We promised the American people we would drain the swamp and end business as usual in Washington. This bill does not do that. We don’t know how many people would use this new tax credit, we don’t know how much it will cost, and we don’t know if this bill will make health care more affordable for Americans.”
“This is exactly the type of back-room dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for and it is not what we promised the American people.”
“Let’s fulfill our Obamacare repeal promise immediately and then take our time and do reform right. Let’s pass the 2015 repeal bill that Republicans in both houses of Congress voted for and sent to the White House just 15 months ago. Once Obamacare has been properly sent to the dustbin of history then we can begin a deliberative, open, and honest process to reform our nation’s health care system.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Paul Introduce Military Humanitarian Operations Act
Date: February 16, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Military Humanitarian Operations Act today, a bill previously introduced by Sen. Lee and former-Sen. Jim Webb (D-VA) in 2012. The Military Humanitarian Operations Act  would require the president to receive congressional authorization before ordering the United States military on a humanitarian mission where hostilities are anticipated.
“The Military Humanitarian Operations Act is consistent with the Constitution and our Founders’ intent for congressional involvement and leadership in matters of war and national security,” Lee said.  “Our military forces are the best in the world, and we owe it to them to ensure their missions have the greatest level of support within Congress and among the American people.”
“Our Founding Fathers understood the importance of co-equal yet separate branches of government. In recent years, Congress has abdicated much of its authority to the executive as it relates to committing our troops overseas or into harm’s way," said Sen. Paul. "I fully believe that Congress needs to reassert its role once again, including in cases of non-emergency humanitarian missions.”
This legislation follows a letter from Sens. Lee and Paul to then President-Elect Trump last month explaining the need to rebalance the sharing of power between Congress and the Executive Branch on national-security issues. Both Senators encouraged President Trump to work closely with Congress to determine our national-security interests and develop a strategy to protect them.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Agency Accountability Act
Date: February 3, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Lee (R-UT) introduced the “Agency Accountability Act of 2017” Friday, a bill that would direct most fines, fees, and other unappropriated proceeds to the Treasury, making them subject to the appropriations process.
“Over time, Congress has given away their power to raise funds to the executive, allowing federal agencies to collect fines, fees, and other revenues outside of the normal appropriations process,” Sen. Lee said. “While a significant portion of these fees and funds are used to offset appropriations, agencies have been known to use some of the fees to self-fund programs that have not necessarily been approved by Congress. This bill is an important step towards increasing transparency, simply by bringing all funds back where they belong – under congressional oversight and authority.”
Rep. Gary Palmer, who introduced a companion bill in the House, added, “For too long Congress has granted federal agencies the authority to collect fines, fees and other revenues outside of their appropriated funds with little to no Congressional oversight on how the monies are spent. Congress’ power of the purse is exclusive and absolute and we must begin reclaiming our Article I authority. I am proud to team up with my colleague Senator Mike Lee on this important piece of legislation in both the House and Senate. "
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has cosponsored the bill in the Senate and the bill has been endorsed by Americans for Limited Government, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, and R Street Institute.

“Judge Gorsuch is a tremendous pick for the Supreme Court and I look forward to doing everything I can to make sure he is confirmed by the Senate,” Lee said.
“I’ve had the privilege of arguing before Judge Gorsuch and he is extremely impressive. He is a prepared, thoughtful, and careful jurist, who has demonstrated a strong commitment to textualism and originalism. His opinions are well-reasoned and brilliantly written, and he has enriched the Tenth Circuit’s jurisprudence in a number of areas during his ten years on the court. He is a judge’s judge, who is well within the mainstream and always decides cases based on what the law says. He also always treats the parties appearing before him with dignity and respect.”
“Throughout 2016, I said the next President should pick the next Supreme Court justice. This vacancy was a central issue during the 2016 campaign and the people have spoken by electing President Trump and returning a Republican Senate majority. I applaud the President for his excellent choice, and I look forward to enthusiastically working toward Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation.”

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Lower Federal Construction Costs
Date: January 30, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act Monday, a bill that would save American taxpayers billions in construction costs.
“The Davis-Bacon Act is an 80-year-old wage subsidy law that requires all federally funded projects worth more than $2,000 to pay workers a so-called ‘prevailing wage,’” Sen. Lee said.
“However, the ‘prevailing wage’ is determined not by market forces operating in reality, but by federal bureaucrats operating in Washington, DC. As a result, federal contractors are charged, on average, a 22 percent premium on their labor costs above what private companies pay for the same project. Repealing the outdated, costly Davis-Bacon Act will give federal contractors the ability to hire more workers of all skill level, while lowering the overall costs of federal transportation construction projects.”
Rep. Steve King  (R-IA), who introduced a companion bill in the House, added: “No one can claim to be a fiscal conservative if they think the federal government needs to inflate the cost of wages. I first dealt with Davis-Bacon wage scales when I started my construction company in 1975. The federal government dictated wage scale to all of my employees on federally funded projects. Micromanaging and disrupting the efficiencies in our businesses has ultimately resulted in an average of 20% higher costs to taxpayers. Simply put, we are bleeding red ink in the federal government. Rather than increasing costs by billions of dollars and restricting our free market, all that should be required is for the employer and the employee to agree on salary and benefits."
Joining Senator Lee in support of the “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” are nine original cosponsors: Sens. Cruz (R-TX), McCain (R-AZ), Cornyn (R-TX), Scott (R-SC), Flake (R-AZ), Perdue (R-GA), Johnson (R-WI), Alexander (R-TN), and Rubio (R-FL).

Title: Sens. Lee, Grassley Introduce Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: January 25, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced an amendment to the United States Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year. This amendment would put a stop to the current “status quo” of Congress spending far more money than the federal government takes in and would place strict limitations on the federal government’s ability to increase taxes, raise the debt limit, and carry out other actions that threaten our long-term fiscal sustainability.
“For far too long, hardworking Americans have been forced to bear the burden of Congress’ inability and unwillingness to control federal overspending,” Lee said. “As our federal debt continues to rise at an alarming rate, the least we can do is require the federal government to not spend more money than it has at its disposal. We expect families, businesses, and state and local governments all to stick to their budgets and live within their means – there is no reason that the federal government should not have to follow the same set of rules.”
“It’s simple math,” said Grassley. “The federal government should not be spending more taxpayer money than it brings in. Families, farmers and businesses across my home state of Iowa and across the entire country make difficult decisions every day to balance the books. It’s the responsible thing to do. Almost every state has adopted some form of a balanced budget requirement, and it’s past time that the federal government follows suit.”
The proposed amendment, S.J. Res 7, would require Congress to spend no more than it collects during any fiscal year, and limits spending to 18% of the gross national product, the 40-year historical average of total federal receipts. Congress can only run a deficit, raise taxes, or increase the debt limit if agreed to by two-thirds of both the House and Senate. Furthermore, the amendment gives standing to any member of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the balanced budget requirement as long as they have been authorized to do so by a petition signed by one-third of either the House or the Senate.
With Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, there is no better time for Congress to pass this amendment and begin taking positive, affirmative steps towards fiscal responsibility.

“I am delighted that this long-standing pro-life foreign aid restriction has been reapplied by President Trump,” Sen. Lee said. ‘Not only has it been reapplied; it has been modernized to take into account the current global health foreign aid environment and will be inclusive of other US foreign aid funding sources beyond simply the USAID family planning account.”
Senator Lee looks forward to working to put such pro-life restrictions into statute later this year.
On Friday, January 20, Senators introduced
S. Res. 15
,
A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the
Mexico
City
policy should be permanently established
, urging presidential action to reapply the Mexico City Policy or an updated version thereof. Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Cornyn (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and James Lankford (R-OK) are cosponsors of this resolution.
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan established the ‘‘Mexico City Policy,’’ which prohibits foreign aid for family planning purposes from being given to foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortion as an option for family planning, regardless of the source of funding. When applied, this prohibits any foreign private or nonprofit entity from receiving US family planning foreign assistance that provides or promotes abortion. President Trump’s version of this policy is updated to encompass the UN Population Fund and other global health funding streams.

Title: Lee Introduces Global Trade Accountability Act
Date: January 20, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Global Trade Accountability Act Friday, a bill that would subject all Executive Branch trade actions (including raising tariffs) to congressional approval.
“Congress has ceded far too much law making power to the Executive branch including the power to unilaterally raise tariffs,” Lee said. “Sudden hikes in trade barriers could wreak havoc on many small and midsize manufacturers in my home state of Utah that rely on imports and globally connected supply chains. Congress must be involved in any decision that would increase barriers to trade.”
The Global Trade Accountability Act would require the president to secure a joint resolution approved by both houses of Congress before any “unilateral trade action” could take effect. The act does allow for “national emergency” exceptions, but only for 90 days, after which the president would still have obtain approval from both houses of Congress.

Title: Senators Ask President Trump to Reapply Modernized Mexico City Policy
Date: January 20, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON  - Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced a resolution Friday expressing the sense of the Senate that the Mexico City policy, or a modernized version thereof, should be permanently established in statute. The resolution also encourages President Trump to immediately take action to reapply the policy.
“There is long-standing statute limiting US foreign assistance from being spent on the promotion or provision of abortion services. Through executive memorandum, Mexico City Policy was created almost 33 years ago. During more than half of the time since the policy’s creation, it has been enforced as standing US foreign aid policy – for a total of 17 years,” Sen. Lee said. “The resolution is a Congressional support document, rooted in legislative and executive history, representing the will of the majority of Americans to see more restrictions on funding for abortion – restrictions President Trump can immediately impose – applied to our foreign aid expenditures of taxpayer dollars.”
The resolution encourages a new executive memorandum from President Trump today or in the coming days, reapplying the policy and its family planning foreign aid restrictions as it was during the Bush administration, while leaving the opportunity for the new administration to review the policy and apply an “improved version thereof.” This language lays the predicate for future legislative action to codify whatever policy the executive applies.
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan established the ‘‘Mexico City Policy,’’ which prohibits foreign aid for family planning purposes from being given to foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortion as an option for family planning, regardless of the source of funding. When applied, this prohibits any foreign private or nonprofit entity from receiving US family planning foreign assistance that provides or promotes abortion.
The resolution states, “That it is the sense of the Senate that— (1) the President should immediately reapply and consider improving the Mexico City Policy; and (2) Congress should expeditiously consider statutory changes that permanently codify the Mexico City Policy or an improved version thereof.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Rubio Call for Fair Taxes for Families
Date: January 19, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) sent a letter to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Ways and Means Committee encouraging them to make tax reform a priority in the 115th Congress and to consider the Economic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan.
“Tax reform should not only reduce the burdens that businesses face, but also do the same for working families,” the letter readers. “Families are the building blocks of our country, the fundamental units of society, and vital to passing down our values from generation to generation. Strong families are also incubators of economic opportunity, financial security, and generate the social capital upon which our free enterprise economy and constitutional republic depend.
With this in mind, it is concerning that our tax code today treats parents unfairly. The payroll taxes that help pay for federal retirement benefits fall on American parents who simultaneously bear the financial cost of raising their children, the next generation of workers whose paychecks will be taxed to fund federal retirement benefits. This function of the tax code creates an implicit “parent tax penalty” – in effect, a tax bias against parents.”
The letter continues, “Tax relief for working families has been a bipartisan effort in the past, and we hope that will continue to be the case this year. As your committees draft legislation to reform the tax code, we urge you to carefully consider the merits of our proposal and ensure tax fairness for working families is not left out.”

Title: Sens. Lee, Paul Call on Pres.-Elect Trump to Increase Congressional Involvement in National Security, Foreign Affairs
Date: January 17, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) sent a letter to President-Elect Donald Trump regarding the importance of rebalancing the relationship between Congress and the Presidency on issues of national security and foreign policy. The letter addresses the need to require Congressional approval for specific military actions before the President can undertake them in the Middle East, and it encourages president-elect Trump to review and work with Congress in repealing or reforming the 2001 and 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs). The letter also addresses the need for the President to engage with the legislative branch and build consensus with Congress and the American people on important issues to our national security, such as our relationships with Russia and China.
The letter states, “While members of Congress have disagreements on many domestic and foreign policies, we all agree that the most fundamental duty of the federal government is to protect the safety, security, and freedoms of the American people. The constitutional powers to carry out this duty are shared between the President and Congress so that our military and diplomatic policies are informed by a long-term vision of American interests – forged through the kind of open debate and patient deliberation that is the province of Congress – while remaining flexible enough to respond to threats as they appear.”
"The complexity of the security questions we face as a nation calls for robust debate, prudence, and cooperation,” the letter continues. “The challenges are too great and the risks too high to simply defer to yesterday’s status quo. Now is the time for bold leadership and sober judgment.  You have an opportunity at the beginning of your presidency to help recommit the Executive Branch to preserving this constitutional balance that has always defined our government at its best, and we stand ready to work with your administration toward that end."

Title: Sens. Lee, Klobuchar Comment on FTC Chair Departure
Date: January 13, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking members of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, released the following statements on Edith Ramirez’s departure from the Federal Trade Commission.
“I thank Chairwoman Ramirez for her service,” said Senator Lee, “but with her departure, the Federal Trade Commission will be left with only two commissioners. Since this is an agency that was meant to operate with five commissioners I expect the next president to nominate new commissioners shortly, and I hope the Senate will confirm them swiftly.”
“Chairwoman Ramirez demonstrated a real commitment to the Federal Trade Commission’s mission. She obtained a $10 billion settlement for consumers defrauded by Volkswagen, her agency litigated as many as eight antitrust cases simultaneously, and she exemplified the best qualities of a public servant,” said Senator Klobuchar.
Chairwoman Ramirez is expected to step down next month.

Title: Lee Introduces Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act
Date: January 12, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Thursday after introducing the “Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act,” a bill which denies all federal funding for implementing the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Final Rule.”
“Every American should be free to choose where to live, and every community should be free to zone its neighborhoods and compete for new residents according to its distinct values,” Lee said. “We don’t need a National Zoning Board. Washington should let Americans ‘govern local.’”
“A better debate would be about how Americans could better spend the money that is wasted every year by the dysfunctional Community Development Block Grant Program,” Lee added.
A study by the Reason Foundation found examples showing how this program contributes to cronyism by channeling taxpayer dollars to politically connected groups while doing absolutely nothing to combat poverty or housing segregation.
The Local Zoning Decisions Act would restrict any federal funding from being used to implement, administer, or enforce HUD’s housing rule. The bill also prohibits any funds from being used for HUD’s “Fair Housing” database which could be used to further the administration’s radical pursuit of using “disparate impact theory” to punish communities that are not as demographically diverse as the administration would like.
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has introduced a companion bill in the House.

Title: Sens. Lee, Rubio, and Cruz Send Letter Supporting Obamacare Repeal Resolution
Date: January 4, 2017

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) sent a letter to Senate Republican leaders Tuesday supporting their efforts to repeal Obamacare within the first weeks of the 115th Congress. The letter reads:
“We understand that this will require first moving a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017 through Congress. While we recognize this budget resolution is primarily a mechanism to advance repeal, it should still contain transparent spending and revenue numbers and include all extant enforcement tools.
“Prior to consideration of this “Obamacare Repeal Resolution,” we wish to affirm our shared commitment to the following process that will lead to the delivery of the following conservative priorities.
“First, it is our belief that the 2017 budget resolution must include reconciliation instructions that enable Congress to quickly consider legislation that repeals at least as much of Obamacare as H.R.3762, which President Obama vetoed in December 2015.  Indeed, we should try to use the reconciliation process to repeal as many provisions of Obamacare as possible, especially the insurance mandates that are driving up health insurance costs for millions of Americans.
“Second, we seek your commitment to passing a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution that sets our new, unified Republican federal government on a path to balance in 10 years without the use of budgetary gimmicks or tax increases.  Our votes in favor of the “Obamacare Repeal Resolution” do not indicate in any way our support for the revenue, spending, and deficit numbers therein, nor for the use of those numbers as the basis for future federal budgets.
“We look forward to working with you this Congress and to delivering on the mandate given to us by the American people to repeal Obamacare and reform the status quo in Washington.”
The letter was addressed to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), and Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and can be read in its entirety here.

While we take no position about the legality of any of the proposed transactions under the antitrust laws, we believe they raise important competition issues that the Department and Commission should carefully review.”

Title: Senators Introduce the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act of 2016
Date: December 6, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act, Monday, a bill that would improve the business of Congress and increase the public’s understanding of its work by establishing a structured congressional clerkship program for recent law school graduates and young lawyers.
“Unlike the Executive and Judicial branches, Congress currently lacks a structured program for recruiting and hiring recent law school graduates,” Sen. Lee said. “Too often this means that new attorneys, who are otherwise qualified and eager to work for Congress, do not even consider a congressional career and are instead pursuing other opportunities.”
“A clerkship can provide invaluable experience to a young lawyer at the start of his or her career,” Sen. Leahy said.  “The federal judiciary has long had a clerkship program that teaches recent law school graduates the workings of the judicial branch.  Yet there has never been a formal clerkship program in Congress.  Creating a pathway for more young lawyers to gain an understanding of how Congress works and the value of public service will lead to a greater embrace of public service.  I am proud to be introducing once again bipartisan legislation to encourage more young lawyers to work in the Congress.”
“We want to attract the best and the brightest to public service,” Sen. Hoeven said. “The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act will create a formal program to bring young, energetic and talented recent law graduates to work  in the Senate and House and see firsthand representative democracy at work.”
“For many years, the brightest young minds coming out of law school have flocked to the federal courts and the executive branch for clerkships and fellowships,” Sen. Cruz said. “Unsurprisingly, this has contributed to the legal profession’s excessive focus on litigation and bureaucratic regulation, at the expense of legislative knowledge and development.  The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act is a small, yet important step in the fight to change that trend.  Ideally, the Act will better position Congress to obtain top-notch services from stellar law school graduates, and it will give those graduates access to—and a much better understanding of—the legislative process.”
Committees in the Senate and the House will be responsible to select at least six clerks each year to perform a one-year clerkship. These committees would oversee the selection process in order to guarantee fair allotment between the majority and minority party offices.
“Senators Lee, Leahy, Hoeven, and Cruz are to be applauded for their vision in championing this bipartisan legislation,” said the Coalition’s Steering Committee, comprised of Larry Kramer, former Dean of Stanford Law School; Robin West, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center; Bill Treanor, Dean of Georgetown University Law Center; Abbe Gluck, law professor at Yale Law School; and Dakota Rudesill, law professor at Ohio State.
“The problem is not that Congress does not have enough lawyers,” the Steering Committee noted.  “Rather, the problem is that Congress is not competitive for the opportunity to apprentice lawyers on the fast track to the legal profession’s most influential ranks.  Congress is missing the opportunity to shape the constitutional perspective of the law’s future leaders.  That is because unlike the federal courts, federal agencies, law firms, and law schools, Congress lacks a regularized apprenticeship program that is readily accessible to any top new law graduate, on the basis of objective qualifications,” the Coalition’s Steering Committee emphasized.
This bill, named after Daniel Webster, is considered one of the most admired and distinguished lawyers and legislators to ever serve in Congress.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces Poverty Measurement Improvement Act
Date: November 17, 2016

Content:
November 17, 2016
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Poverty Measurement Act today, a bill designed to improve the income and demographic data available to lawmakers when analyzing our nation’s safety net programs.
“Lawmakers should always have the best information possible whenever they are making policy,” Lee said. “This is especially true for an issue as vital as our nation’s social safety net programs. Unfortunately, the Census Bureau’s current official poverty rate does not always match up with data from other government sources. This bill would fix that problem by authorizing a new Census Bureau survey that would more accurately capture how those Americans who are at or near poverty live.”
The Poverty Measurement Act would authorize a new Census Bureau survey to calculate income and receipt of Federal means-tested benefits. This information will then be linked with individual records from the IRS and the agencies that administer means-tested benefits to provide a more accurate picture of poverty in the United States. A recent study of New York residents found that Census Bureau income calculations missed over one-third of housing assistance recipients, forty percent of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, and sixty percent of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) payments.

Title: Bipartisan, bicameral bill would delay changes to government hacking powers
Date: November 17, 2016

Content:
Proposed Amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure would expand the government’s ability to search Americans’ computers and other digital devices
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Al Franken (D-Minn.), together with Reps. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) and Ted Poe (R-Texas), introduced legislation to provide Congress the time necessary to seriously consider and debate the proposed changes to Rule 41 that would expand the government's ability to search computers and other digital devices. The
Review the Rule Act
would delay the proposed changes to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 from going into force until July 1, 2017. Without congressional action, the proposed changes will go into effect on December 1, 2016.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 governs the procedures and parameters for issuing search warrants.  Under current law, a federal judge may issue a warrant to search property located within a specific judicial district.  At the urging of the Department of Justice, the Supreme Court ultimately approved two sweeping amendments to Rule 41:
A judge may issue a warrant to remotely search, copy, and seize information from a device that does not have a known location (and may not be in the district) because the location has been concealed through technological means; and
A single judge may issue a warrant to remotely search and copy information from suspected devices across five or more districts.
“The proposed changes are serious, and present significant privacy concerns that warrant careful consideration and debate,”
said Senator Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Our bicameral, bipartisan legislation will give Congress time to do our job and carefully consider and evaluate the merits of these proposed changes to the government’s ability to search personal computers and other digital devices. It is essential that these rules strike a careful balance: giving law enforcement the tools it needs to keep us safe, while also protecting Americans’ constitutional rights to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches.”
“We cannot give the federal government a blank check to infringe on Americans’ civil liberties,”
said Senator Daines.
“Congress needs the appropriate time to investigate the implications of this rule on Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights.”
“A single prosecutor should not have the power to hack into the phone or computer of virtually anyone in the United States,”
said Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Yes, federal law enforcement does need new tools to stop and prosecute botnets, but the proposed Rule 41 rule change goes too far. The sensible thing to do is delay the implementation of this rule and allow Congress to investigate further."
“This rule change would give the government unprecedented power to hack into Americans’ personal devices,”
Senator Wyden said.
“This was an alarming proposition before the election. Today, Congress needs to think long and hard about whether to hand this power to James Comey and the administration of someone who openly said he wants the power to hack his political opponents the same way Russia does.”
“I remain deeply concerned about the intended and unintended consequences of the expanded authorities contemplated in the proposed changes to Rule 41,”
said John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member.
“The bill we offer today will delay implementation until Congress has had a meaningful opportunity to examine the proposal in detail.  Until we have adequately addressed the privacy concerns raised by my colleagues, this rule change should not take effect.”
“Government does not have the authority to unilaterally legalize widespread abusive hacking,”
said Rep. Poe.
“It is Congress’ responsibility to safeguard the constitutional rights of the people they represent from a power hungry Executive Branch. A delay in the proposed changes to Rule 41 is necessary to ensure that the newly elected Congress, and Administration, have the ability to carefully evaluate this rule change before it goes into effect to ensure that it is constitutional and in the best interests of the American people. Rushing to put the changes in place in the middle of the lame duck session is irresponsible. Too much is at stake to not get this right.”

“If President Obama and his advisors want to increase the involvement of the United States in Syria in any manner - including attacks against the Assad regime - they have a constitutional responsibility to ask for a declaration of war from Congress,” Sen. Lee said. "What the administration is considering represents a major departure from our current strategy, and carries potentially cataclysmic consequences which the American people have never debated in Congress. Should President Obama move ahead without authorization, then Congress must be called back into session to fulfill its obligation to debate and determine whether our nation should once again go to war.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Rubio Call Out “Cultural Imperialism” of OAS
Date: October 3, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) urged the State Department Monday, to re-examine the way U.S. contributions to the Organization of American States (OAS) are utilized in light of ongoing concerns of ideological agenda pushing by the UN-backed entity. Part of this inquiry includes a push to fully implement the Organization of American States (OAS) Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 and address concerns about the OAS imposing its cultural views on OAS member states.
The letter states that legislators “have heard from Central and South American officials that their own national sovereignty is threatened by what they view as ‘cultural imperialism’ imposed by an organization that is seemingly more concerned with pushing an ideological agenda than respecting the local rule of law.”
The U.S. provided for more than one-third (41.7%) of the OAS’ 2015 total budget, continuing in the historic pattern of the U.S. contributing the largest sum of funds for this entity. The OAS Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 requires a multiyear strategy be provided to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a quarterly briefing that analyzes the progress made by the OAS. The letter suggests it is not clear that the Department is implementing the requirements of this law.
Considering that the U.S. is the largest donor of the OAS, the letter requests an in-person briefing from State Department officials responsible for Western Hemisphere Affairs and U.S. representation to the OAS.

Title: Sen. Lee Statement on Continuing Resolution Vote

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Wednesday, following his vote against a continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through December 9, 2016:
“By funding the government for only three months, this CR sets up a lame-duck session later this year, which is a prime target for special-interest insiders who know just how easy it is to extract benefits from members of Congress who are no longer accountable to their voters.
“Proponents of the bill claim this is what a ‘clean’ CR looks like. They praise the bill for excluding any and all ‘policy riders.’
“But in truth, this CR has plenty of so-called ‘policy riders,’ but only those that received the blessing of the select few who wrote the legislation. So it includes a provision that will give Planned Parenthood a raise, but contains nothing to delay President Obama’s reckless plan to give countries like China, Russia, and Iran more control over the Internet.
“This is not how the Senate should do business and I will not sanction it with my vote.”

WASHINGTON—Today Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), John Barrasso (R-WY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) expressed concern over the participation of the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in a potential multimillion dollar bailout of select insurance companies through the Affordable Care Act’s Risk Corridors Program (RCP). In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Secretary Sylvia Burwell, and Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt, the senators requested an explanation of the availability of funds to settle claims for payment under the RCP.
The letter states: “The health care law contained three risk mitigation programs, one of which is the temporary Risk Corridor Program.  This program was originally intended to be implemented in a budget neutral manner.  This intention was confirmed when Congress passed, with Presidential approval, two separate provisions of appropriations law confirming its budget neutrality.  It now appears the Administration is preparing to circumvent these actions.”
The letter discusses the use of the judgement fund to resolve claims filed against the government for non-payment under the RCP, concluding that “it would be inappropriate for the Judgement Fund to be used to settle any litigation stemming from the risk corridor program. Accordingly, we write to ascertain specifically how CMS intends to go about seeking ‘resolution of those claims’ so that federal law is not violated.”

Title: Lee Responds to Trade Representative Statement on Brexit
Date: September 22, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday in response to comments made by Trade Representative Mike Froman about United States trade priorities.
“When the British people chose sovereignty this June by voting to leave the European Union, many feared President Obama could greatly damage both our nations by following through on his threat to send the United Kingdom 'to the back of the queue' when it came to negotiating trade deals,” Sen. Lee said. “Now, President Obama’s Trade Representative has told Bloomberg that threat is 'in reality the case.’"
“This is simply unacceptable. The United States’ relationship with the United Kingdom is more important than the personal disappointment of an outgoing president. That is why I introduced the United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act with Sen. Tom Cotton this June. Our bill would continue all existing commercial agreements with the United Kingdom as if the U.K. were still part of the European Union. It also calls on the President to initiate negotiations for new bilateral agreements with the United Kingdom 30 days after the bill is enacted. Congress should act quickly to pass the United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act before the year is out."

Title: Utah Delegation, Gov. Herbert, Release Joint Statement in Opposition of Monument Designation in Utah
Date: September 21, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – The entire Utah congressional delegation, including Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT), Reps. Rob Bishop (R-UT), Chris Stewart (R-UT), Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), and Mia Love (R-UT), as well as Gov. Gary Herbert issued the following joint statement today in opposition of a monument designation in Utah:
“We, the Congressional Delegation of the Great State of Utah, stand in solidarity with local Native Americans, the people of San Juan County and elected officials at the local, county and state levels of Utah government in opposition to the unilateral designation of the proposed Bears Ears national monument. The protection of our nation’s historic, cultural and natural resources is among the noblest of pursuits and we agree that this unique part of our state needs to be preserved. However, turning our backs on the democratic process to do so undermines who we are as Americans. We support a solution where local voices are not only heard, but integrated into public land management.”

Title: Lee, Hatch Introduce the Utah National Monument Parity Act
Date: September 15, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the Utah National Monument Parity Act, Tuesday, a bill that would extend the same Antiquities Act protections Wyoming now enjoys to Utah.
“New Yorkers would not appreciate it if Utahns came in and told them what they could and couldn’t build in Manhattan,” Sen. Lee said, “and Utahns don’t like it when out of state special interest groups tell us how to use our land either. Over 50 years ago the state of Wyoming was granted protections from Antiquities Act abuse in their state, and all Utahns are asking is for that same protection to be extended to their state,” Lee finished.
Senator Hatch added, “Nearly twenty years ago, the Clinton administration blindsided Utah with a massive 1.9-million-acre monument designation in Southern Utah. With this unilateral action, the President defied the will of Utah’s elected representatives and a strong majority of the state’s residents. Today, we are again faced with the threat of a unilateral designation of another 1.8-million-acre monument in southeast Utah. Such a designation would far exceed the purpose of the Antiquities Act, which was written specifically to protect special cultural sites and objects limited to the smallest compatible area necessary. If the Obama administration insists on such an overreach of its Antiquities Act authority to lock away massive swaths of land in Utah again—over the strong objections of both Utah’s elected leaders and the affected communities—then Congress must be prepared to act as a responsible check on executive authority.”
First enacted in 1906, the Antiquities Act was originally used to protect archeological sites and Native American structures from looting and vandalism. The act specifically requires that lands designated as national monuments under the act must be “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”
Unfortunately the Antiquities Act has since become the preferred vehicle for imposing executive branch vanity projects on unsupportive local communities. In 1950, after President Franklin Roosevelt created the Jackson Hole National Monument, Congress enacted a law prohibiting future Antiquities Act designations in Wyoming. The people of Utah are only asking that those same protections be extended to their state.
Our national parks and wilderness areas are national treasures. But those land use designations came through the compromise and collaboration with local communities that are necessary in a democratic process. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-UT) has gone through that process and written a bill, that Public Lands Initiative, that would protect the natural and historic treasures of southeast Utah. A unilateral Antiquities Act designation by the White House would only shut off debate and circumvent that democratic process.

Title: Senators Introduce Bipartisan Modern Government Travel Act
Date: September 15, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Modernizing Government Travel Act Thursday, a bill that would direct the General Services Administration to make it easier for government employees to save taxpayers money by using innovative modes of travel while on official government business.
“Millions of Americans have saved themselves time and money by using new innovative travel services such as Uber, Lyft, and bikeshare,” Sen. Lee said, “but current federal travel reimbursement regulations have made it difficult for federal employees to use these new technologies while on the job. This bill would require the GSA to clarify the availability of these options so our federal employees can increase efficiency and decrease costs.”
“It makes sense for government employees to use the same services as everyday people and it will save the taxpayers dollars,” said Dr. Cassidy.
“Services like Lyft and Uber have improved the ways that millions of Americans get around, but, until recently, the federal government hasn’t been able to take advantage of these newer, sometimes more cost-effective options,” said Sen. Carper. “This legislation will help our government keep pace with the innovative technologies that drive our lives. By modernizing the way that federal employees travel, this commonsense and bipartisan bill will make the operations of government more efficient, while also ensuring that we are being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”
“This legislation helps drive federal agencies into the modern era,” said Sen. Johnson. “All across the country, people are using car services such as Uber and Lyft to get where they need to go conveniently and affordably. Many Americans are even supplementing their current income by driving for these companies. I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation, which will provide an option for federal employees to take Uber or Lyft when they’re on official business, saving taxpayer money.”
“I am pleased to join Senator Lee and Senator Carper to introduce common sense legislation that ensures the federal government updates its policies to keep pace with innovation and better reflect how people travel today,” said Sen. Booker. “Government employees should be able to take advantage of cost-effective ridesharing services and save taxpayer dollars.”WASHINGTON - Sens.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Pay for Printing Act
Date: September 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Pay for Printing Act Wednesday, a bill that will require the senator sponsoring a ceremonial or commemorative Senate resolution to reimburse the Government Printing Office for the cost of printing.
“The Pay for Printing Act will allow Senators to continue recognizing the achievements of their constituents,” Lee said. “But if a Senator is going to recognize a specific constituent or group in his or her state, then it should be up to that Senator to pay the costs of printing that resolution.”
The prepress costs for the Government Printing Office to print one page of a commemorative resolution have varied between about $40 to over $120. Currently those costs are covered by American taxpayers no matter where they live. The Pay for Printing Act will allow senators to use their official office expense account to pay for these commemorative resolutions.

Title: Lee, Klobuchar React to Proposed Bayer- Monsanto Merger
Date: September 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, issued the following statements on the proposed acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer:
“The proposed acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer raises serious antitrust issues,” said Sen. Lee. “Bayer and Monsanto are two of the leading companies that provide key inputs, such as seeds and herbicides, to farmers to grow essential crops – and the combination of these two companies may have troubling implications for farmers and American consumers. The transaction has the potential to result in a significant loss of competition and reduced incentives and ability to innovate, thereby raising prices and reducing consumer choice. I will encourage the DOJ or FTC to closely scrutinize the transaction and will consider whether a hearing is necessary to fully explore the competition issues raised by so much consolidation in such a short time.”
“The current wave of consolidations in the seed industry has major implications for the agriculture supply chain that must be examined. This proposed acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer merits close scrutiny by regulators to examine its potential impacts on farmers and consumers across Minnesota and our country,” said Sen.  Klobuchar. “We must consider not just the merger's impact on seed prices, but whether it will also stifle innovation and competition. As Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I take seriously the responsibility to provide oversight over potential consolidations and to ensure that antitrust laws are vigorously enforced to protect competition.”

I am grateful to Senator Grassley for holding this hearing and look forward to the opportunity to address any antitrust or competition issues that may arise in connection with the proposed transactions,” said Senator Lee.
“Consolidation in the seed industry has implications for the entire food chain, and the dramatic changes being contemplated merit close scrutiny,” said Senator Klobuchar. “This Judiciary Committee hearing will allow us to examine the impact of the proposed consolidation on farmers and consumers. I look forward to examining these issues and their impact on competition.”

Title: Lee Reacts to DOJ Review of ASCAP, BMI
Date: August 5, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, the Department of Justice announced that it has closed its review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees without seeking any modifications at this time. The consent decrees have governed the licensing of performance rights for musical compositions since they were established in 1941. In 2014, ASCAP and BMI, the performance rights organizations that administer the issuance of licenses and the collection of royalties, requested that DOJ amend the consent decrees to allow individual publishers to withdraw their rights for digital performances, giving them greater negotiating power with internet music companies like Pandora. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition and Consumer Protection released the following statement:
“The Department of Justice has been examining whether to amend the consent decrees that govern the licensing of music performance rights for over a year and a half,” said Lee. “The complicated nature of the consent decrees and of the market for musical licenses requires such an exhaustive review, and I appreciate the agency’s thoroughness. As we emphasized in the Subcommittee’s hearing on these issues in March of last year, any government oversight of this market must encourage creativity by recognizing the value of copyrights and ensure that prices for music remain competitive for consumers.”
For more information on these issues and the views of stakeholders, please watch the Subcommittee’s hearing from March 10, 2015, entitled,

Title: Lee, Herbert, Bishop Issue Joint Statement After Bears Ears Hearing
Date: August 1, 2016

Content:
BLANDING, UT—Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Gov. Gary Herbert, and Rep. Rob Bishop (UT-01) issued the following statement after today’s Energy and Natural Resources field hearing on the potential Bears Ears monument designation:
"We have listened to the people of San Juan County and the verdict is clear: the people who live near Bears Ears do not want Washington, DC to create a Bears Ears monument. We hope that the current administration will take this opportunity to choose a path of cooperation and consensus, and not let outside interest groups force their preferences on the people that live here."
"Taking care of their ancestral land – protecting and preserving it for the next generation – isn’t optional for many Native Americans; it’s a sacred duty,” Sen. Lee said. “Take away their access to the land – restrict their stewardship over the earth’s bounty – and it won’t be long before their culture begins to fade away. Yet that’s exactly what the Obama administration is contemplating with the potential national-monument designation of the Bears Ears region.”
"There is a big difference between having something done to us rather than something done with us,” Gov. Herbert said. “A unilateral monument designation forced upon the local community would be incredibly divisive. Fortunately there is a better path forward with the Public Lands Initiative."
“Having been in San Juan County today, it is more clear than ever to me that the PLI is the will of the people, not a national monument," said Rep. Bishop. "We are dealing with people's lives here - and that deserves the careful consideration that the legislative process provides. Mandating a monument with the stroke of a pen will only exacerbate local issues and will chip away at people's right to control their own destiny.”
Lee chaired today’s hearing with Herbert and Bishop participating as witnesses. Additional witnesses included Chester Johnson, Aneth Chapter of the Navajo Nation; Lewis Singer, Blue Mountain Dine; and Bruce Adams, San Juan County Commissioner. Officials from the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service, as well as members of the Bears Ears Coalition were invited to today’s hearing, but declined to participate.

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Comment on Insurance Merger Transaction Announcements
Date: July 21, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, released the following statements on the Department of Justice’s announcement on the Aetna/Humana and Anthem/Cigna transactions.
“Last September we held a hearing to explore proposed mergers between four of the nation’s five largest health insurance companies: the Aetna-Humana merger and the Anthem-Cigna merger,” said Lee. “We examined whether reducing the so-called “Big Five” in health insurance providers to the “Big Three” could result in market concentration harmful to consumers. The Justice Department has reached its decision, but we will continue to exercise oversight as the cases proceed.”
“The proposed merger of four of the five largest health insurance companies deserves close scrutiny, and as I said in the hearing we held last fall, cost-effective insurance is critical for Americans to have access to affordable, quality health care,” said Klobuchar. “I applaud the Department of Justice’s aggressive defense of competition, which is the best medicine to control health insurance premiums and improve quality.”

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces The Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act
Date: July 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act Wednesday, a bill that give would give farmers and ranchers the freedom not to participate in Department of Agriculture check-off programs.
“If farmers and ranchers want to get together and pool their resources to better promote their products, then that is the free market at its best,” Lee said. “But as soon as the power of the federal government is used to force people into a program they do not want to participate in, then that is crony capitalism at its worst.”
Check-off programs are funded through compulsory fees on producers of milk, eggs, beef, and a multitude of other agricultural products. The programs and associated boards regularly receive criticism for their lack of transparency, apparent conflicts of interest, misuse of their power, anticompetitive behavior, and other related issues.
The Voluntary Check-Off Program Participation Act would allow farmers and ranchers to participate in check-off programs if they desire to while ending the tax on those producers who would prefer not to participate in these programs.

Title: Sens. Lee, Booker Introduce Commodity Check Off Reform Bill
Date: July 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced on Wednesday‎ S. 3201, the Commodity Checkoff Program Improvement Act of 2016, a measure intended to bring much needed transparency and accountability to the federal government’s commodity check off programs.
Checkoff programs are mandatory participation programs under the US Department of Agriculture. These programs are funded through compulsory fees on producers of eggs, beef, pork and a multitude of other agricultural products. The programs and associated boards have received criticism in the past for a lack of transparency, apparent conflicts of interest, misuse of their funding and anticompetitive behavior.
“Last year a FOIA request uncovered some troubling emails between the American Egg Board and top executives in the egg industry,” Lee said. “This was a classic case of Big Government and Big Business working together to squeeze out smaller rivals and squelch innovation.”
The American Egg Board CEO at the center of those emails has since resigned, but questions remain about the board’s activities.
“When checkoff programs engage in anticompetitive activity, it is a threat to a dynamic and informed free marketplace,” Booker said. “This bipartisan legislation will help increase transparency and restore trust in checkoff program practices.”
This bill is a direct response to the egg board scandal and past checkoff program misconduct, and the changes proposed by this legislation are designed to improve checkoff board behavior and avoid similar conduct in the future.
To improve the practices of checkoff programs, the Commodity Checkoff Program Improvement Act would:
· Prohibit checkoff programs from contracting with any organization that lobbies on agricultural policy;
· Prohibit employees and agents of the checkoff boards from engaging in activities that may involve a conflict of interest;
· Prohibit checkoff programs from engaging in anticompetitive activity, unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or any act that may be disparaging to another agricultural commodity or product;
· Require transparency through publication of checkoff program budgets and expenditures;
· Require periodic audits by the USDA Inspector General for compliance with the Improvement Act; and
· Require a GAO audit of check off program compliance and a report with further recommendations related to checkoff programs.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Act
Date: July 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Act Wednesday, a bill that would allow more Americans to mountain bike in wilderness areas.
“Our National Wilderness Preservation System was created so that the American people could enjoy the solitude and recreational opportunities of this continent’s priceless natural areas,” Lee said. “This bill would enrich Americans enjoyment of the outdoors by making it easier for them to mountain bike in wilderness areas.”
“Utah is blessed with an abundance of beautiful wilderness, and Americans should be free to enjoy it,” Hatch said. “This bill presents a reasonable approach to allowing the use of mountain bikes on trails and grant federal land managers the ability to do necessary maintenance.”
Specifically, the Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Act would:
(1) Allow local land managers to decide whether to allow and how to manage mountain biking in wilderness areas; and
(2) Allow federal employees or designees to use non-invasive, minimal technology to maintain wilderness trails.

Title: Lee Testimony on First Amendment Defense Act
Date: July 12, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—This morning, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) will testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA). Remarks as prepared for delivery are available below.
Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and members of the Committee: thank you for holding this hearing today and for inviting me to testify in support of the First Amendment Defense Act.  It’s an honor to be here and to participate with my fellow witnesses and all of you in this important discussion.
I would like to preface my statement today by issuing a challenge to all of those involved in this debate here on Capitol Hill and across the country – myself included. As we engage in dialogue with one another about this highly charged topic, let’s commit to treating one another with respect and courtesy, as fellow citizens rather than as adversaries. Let’s insist on hashing out our honest differences honestly. It’s too easy to assume the worst in those with whom you disagree, to impugn their motives so you don’t have to listen to their arguments. Let’s be better than that today. We all came here to talk, but let’s not forget also to listen.
And with that, I’ll now spend a few more minutes talking.
The most important feature of the First Amendment Defense Act is its exceptionally narrow scope. If enacted, the bill would do one thing and one thing only: it would prevent the federal government from discriminating against particular disfavored religious beliefs.
There are other forms of discrimination in the world – for instance, the discrimination that may occur between two private parties. But these are entirely different issues, unrelated to the First Amendment Defense Act.
This bill deals exclusively with a most pernicious form of discrimination in which the federal government singles out certain religious beliefs for disfavored treatment. The bill is so narrowly focused because it is a targeted response to particular legal developments that have taken place in the past year.
In the wake of last year’s decision by the Supreme Court in the same-sex marriage case, Obergefell v. Hodges, many millions of Americans were left wondering: What does this mean for me?
Many wondered what the Court’s decision would mean for the countless institutions within our civil society – churches and synagogues, charities and adoption agencies, counseling services and religiously affiliated schools – that are made up of American citizens who believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman. For instance, now that the Supreme Court had discovered a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, would a school that holds the belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman be in danger of losing its tax-exempt status?
More than one year after the Obergefell decision, these questions remain unanswered.
On the one hand, the Court’s majority opinion in the Obergefell case reiterated the meaning of religious liberty that has always been understood in America when it stated, “The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.”
But on the other hand, there was the ominous exchange between Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli during oral arguments in the case that seemed to suggest that the Obama administration would be comfortable with the notion that the IRS could revoke the tax-exempt status of religious institutions – including schools – that maintain the traditional definition of marriage.
The First Amendment Defense Act is a very narrow and targeted legislative response to these still unanswered questions. The bill reaffirms the letter and spirit of the First Amendment, by stating unequivocally that the federal government may not revoke or deny a federal tax exemption, grant, contract, accreditation, license, or certification to an individual or institution based on a religious belief about marriage.
The First Amendment protects each of us from punishment or reprisal from the federal government for living in accordance with our deeply held religious or moral convictions. Adhering to these convictions should never disqualify an individual from receiving federal grants, contracts, or a tax status.
What an individual or organization believes about marriage is not – and should never be – a part of the government’s eligibility rubric in distributing licenses, accreditations, or grants. And the First Amendment Defense Act simply ensures that this will always be true in America – that federal bureaucrats will never have the authority to require those who believe in the traditional definition of marriage to choose between their living in accordance with those beliefs and maintaining their occupation, their tax status, or their eligibility to receive grants, licenses or contracts.
The First Amendment Defense Act is absolutely critical to the many charitable and service organizations in this country whose convictions about marriage are fundamental to their work and mission. Guaranteeing the full protection of these organizations’ First Amendment rights will ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are not forced to discontinue their foster care and adoption services on account of their belief that every child needs a married mother and father. It will protect religiously affiliated schools from losing their accreditation or being compelled to eliminate housing options for students. And it will protect individuals, regardless of their beliefs about marriage, from being deprived of eligibility for federal grants, licenses, and employment because of their deeply held convictions.
Now, you may hear tall tales – and some outright falsehoods – about this bill.  Some may suggest that FADA would give private businesses a license to violate anti-discrimination laws with impunity.  This is just not so.  The bill does not preempt, negate or alter any anti-discrimination measures or civil-rights laws, state or federal.  To be clear:  this bill does not take anything away from any individual or group, because it does not modify any of our existing civil-rights protections.
The First Amendment Defense Act does not allow federal workers or contractors to deny services or benefits to same-sex couples; and it does not allow hospitals to refuse medically necessary treatment or visitation rights to individuals in same-sex relationships.
I invite everyone to read the bill, so you can see in black and white that the First Amendment Defense Act does not do any of these things. It simply affirms all Americans’ God-given, constitutionally-protected right to live according to their religious or moral convictions without fear of punishment by the government – especially when it comes to operating churches, schools, charities, or businesses. It recognizes that religious liberty in America has always meant that the government’s job is not to tell people what to believe or how to discharge their religious duties, but to protect the space for all people of all faiths – and of no faith at all – to seek religious truth and to order their lives accordingly.
Questions surrounding marriage today are difficult, and reasonable people of good faith will reach different judgments about how best to protect religious liberty. But the First Amendment must remain our lodestar. And I believe any differences of opinion can be constructively worked out – even and especially as to particular provisions of this bill – if our shared concern remains preserving the American tradition of religious liberty. I hope it is.
Thank you.

Title: Sens. Lee, Sasse Introduce Alternatives to Licensing that Lower Obstacles to Work (ALLOW) Act
Date: July 12, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON  - Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ben Sasse (R-NE) introduced legislation Tuesday that would make it easier for many Americans to begin work in their chosen field by reducing unnecessary licensing burdens.
“The principle at the heart of the American economic system is equality of opportunity. In practice, this means eliminating all forms of legal privilege and political favoritism, so that the economy rewards hard work, initiative, good judgment, and personal responsibility,” Lee said. “Unfortunately too many localities have allowed licensing requirements to become a barrier that prevent younger and less fortunate workers from getting better and higher-paying jobs.”
In 1950, fewer than 5 percent of American workers were subject to licensing requirements. Today, that figure stands at around 30 percent.
The Alternatives to Licensing that Lower Obstacles to Work Act would serve as a model to states for occupational licensing reform by creating a office in the District Attorney General’s Office that would actively supervise occupational licensing boards, including both “sunrise” and “sunset” reviews of all licensing requirements.

Title: Lee, Cotton Introduce United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act
Date: June 30, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced the “United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act” Wednesday, a bill designed to promote economic stability and growth as the United Kingdom transitions out of the European Union.
“Our nation’s special relationship with the United Kingdom has promoted economic prosperity and security in both countries for over a hundred years,” Sen. Lee said. “This relationship can and should be preserved,” Lee continued, “which is why we have introduced legislation that would minimize uncertainty and promote stability as the United Kingdom declares their independence from the European Union.”
“The United Kingdom has stood with us at the front lines of battle, and it should therefore be at the front of the line for a free trade agreement that benefits both our nations,” Sen. Cotton said. “At this time of transition for our ancestral ally, it is in our deepest interest to reaffirm the Special Relationship. And it is my hope that our other European allies will also move in the spirit of magnanimity, generosity, and continued friendship as they negotiate new partnerships with the United Kingdom.”
The United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act preserves and promotes our special relationship with the British in two ways:
First, the bill obligates the United States to continue all existing commercial agreements with the United Kingdom as if the United Kingdom were still part of the European Union.
Second, the bill calls on the President to initiate negotiations for new bilateral agreements with the United Kingdom 30 days after the bill is enacted.

Title: Sens. Lee, Sessions Call For Higher Defense Spending By NATO Members
Date: June 28, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to President Obama Tuesday stating that the viability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is contingent upon a more equitable distribution of the collective defense burden, and requesting that this be a top priority of the administration at next month’s NATO Summit in Warsaw
According to NATO’s own figures, the United States’ defense spending accounts for 73% of defense spending in the alliance as a whole despite the fact that the combined GDP of all other allies is higher than that of the United States.
Nearly half of the alliance members have failed to meet long-standing goals for defense spending as a proportion of GDP despite the pleas of both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations. Lately, the United States has been forced to spend emergency funds to enhance European defenses in the face of new Russian aggression even though the combined economies of European nations are vastly larger and more stable than that of Russia. The letter states:
“In lieu of giving our highly capable European allies a crutch of defense aid for years to come, we must begin making this aid contingent upon real investment from their governments starting with adjustments to their national budgets now.”
NATO stands to play a beneficial role for the United States and Europe as it did in the 20th Century, but important reforms and budgetary policies must be enacted by our allies to keep up with the geo-political and economic changes since the end of the Cold War.

Title: Lee Statement on ‘Brexit’ Vote Results
Date: June 24, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement on the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union:
"The decision by the British people to leave the EU is a rejection of centralized power and unaccountable bureaucracy, a sentiment widely shared by many Americans. Our relationship with the United Kingdom has been one of the most successful in the history of the world and now more than ever we must respect the will of their people. This relationship can and should be preserved, which is why I plan to introduce legislation both requiring the United States to honor our current agreements with the United Kingdom until new bilateral agreements can be negotiated, and directing the U.S. Trade Representative to begin negotiations on new bilateral agreements as soon as possible."

This reminder is even more crucial given that Hillary Clinton has promised to end almost all deportations categorically. In the meantime, I will continue to work with my colleagues to achieve real, step-by-step reform of our immigration system.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Hold Antitrust Subcommittee Hearing on CREATES Act, Bipartisan Legislation to Address Rising Prescription Drug Prices
Date: June 21, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, held a subcommittee hearing on bipartisan legislation to address rising prescription drug prices. Last week, Lee, Klobuchar, and Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act to deter pharmaceutical companies from blocking cheaper generic alternatives from entering the marketplace.
"Nearly everyone has a story about sticker shock at the pharmacy counter, or anger at learning the drug they need isn’t covered by their health insurance,” Lee said. “Unfortunately complex regulatory environments are being abused by some firms to avoid competition and keep prices high. Our CREATES Act aims to lower prices and increase access by creating two causes of action by which generic competitors can end such abuse."
“Today’s hearing was an opportunity to discuss the need to take action on our bipartisan legislation to protect American consumers from the anticompetitive practices used by some brand-name pharmaceutical and biologic companies,” Klobuchar said. “We examined how these harmful practices result in unjustified inflation that drives up prescription drug costs for everyone. By working to ensure that those decisions are driven by competition, not anti-consumer actions from pharmaceutical companies, the CREATES Act prevents companies from strategically blocking generic approval. This would potentially save consumers billions of dollars in prescription drug costs and allow consumers to focus on their health, rather than the cost of their prescriptions.”
The legislation, a version of which was introduced in the House last year, is strongly supported by the Generic Pharmaceutical Association of America (GPHA), consumer groups including AARP, Consumers Union, Public Citizen and Families USA; the American College of Physicians; the American Hospital Association; the AFL-CIO; and the National Coalition on Health Care.

Title: Sen. Lee Votes For Common Sense Crime Bills

WASHINGTON ­ Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) supported cloture on two common sense crime bills Monday authored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). Lee also voted against cloture on two gun control measures sponsored by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
“So many of our past mass shootings could have been prevented by robust enforcement of our existing gun laws,” Lee said. “Chairman Grassley should be commended for putting together a common sense crime bill that aims to increase enforcement while protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.”
Sen. Cornyn’s bill is a step toward reducing future tragedies,” Lee added. “I look forward to working with him to tighten these protections in the future.”
“Unfortunately I was not able to vote for either of the gun control measures offered by Sens. Murphy and Feinstein,” Lee continued. “Murphy’s amendment requiring universal background checks is far too broad and would sweep far too many otherwise law abiding Americans into its scope. Feinstein’s bill is also problematic since it would deprive far too many Americans of their constitutional rights without offering adequate judicial review.”

Title: Sen. Lee Comments on DC Circuit’s Net Neutrality Decision
Date: June 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday in response to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals decision to uphold the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality regulation.
“I was disappointed in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals decision to uphold the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order, a regulation that has already led to a decline in innovation at the expense of ordinary Americans.
“Judge Williams’ 69-page dissent will not be forgotten though, particularly his conclusion that: ‘the Commission’s unreasoned patchwork … shunts broadband service into the legal track suited to natural monopolies.’ This will only result in a far less free and open Internet, as it ensures government protection of incumbent firms.
“Today’s decision reinforces the importance of the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, a bill that I recently introduced in the Senate, which aims to nullify the FCC’s Open Internet Order in order to foster the development of a more democratic, fact-based, and economically reasonable approach to ensuring transparency and consumer protection in the Internet ecosystem.
“Today’s decision also illustrates the dysfunction that arises when Congress delegates vast discretionary authority to unelected federal bureaucrats, and points to the need for Congress to reclaim its lawmaking powers currently exercised by rule-writing agencies in the Executive Branch. To that end, earlier this year I joined nine of my colleagues to launch the Article 1 Project: a new network of House and Senate conservatives working together on a new agenda of government reform and congressional rehabilitation.
“The policies advanced by A1P members seek to reassert Congress’s legislative authority, ensuring that the American people’s elected representatives are responsible, and accountable, for the country’s laws.”

Title: Economists Praise Sen. Lee’s Drug Cost Reduction Bill
Date: June 14, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – The International Center for Law and Economics (ICLE), a think tank dedicated to economically-grounded policymaking, praised Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) new CREATES Act Tuesday. The bill would lower the drug costs of millions of Americans by making it easier for generic drugs to reach the market.
The CREATES Act “would mitigate the competitive leverage that brand manufacturers are currently able to exercise under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act’s imperfectly drafted REMS provisions,” ICLE executive director Geoffrey Manne said. “Unlike many other legislative fixes, Senator Lee’s bill takes a narrow targeted approach to correcting problems directly, rather than creating a vast new scope of antitrust liability for drug manufacturers,” Manne finished.
The 2007 FDAAA empowered the FDA to demand a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from a drug manufacturer whenever “new safety information” came to light about one of their existing products. Intended to increase patient safety, some drug companies soon learned they could use REMS to restrict distribution of their brand drugs, including refusing to sell samples to generic drug manufacturers.
Without these samples, generic drug manufacturers cannot comply with the FDA’s existing process for getting generic drugs approved for the market. By delaying the entry of generic drugs into the market, drug companies are then able to charge higher monopoly prices for their drugs for longer periods of time.
While attempts have been made to combat this abuse through use of the antitrust laws, the underlying issue is a regulatory one.‎ The CREATES Act addresses the problem by allowing generic drug companies to sue brand pharmaceutical manufacturers who are refusing to sell them drug samples.
The CREATES Act is cosponsored by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

Title: Email Privacy Bill Delayed By Warrantless Search Amendment
Date: June 9, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Thursday after pulling the ECPA Amendments Act from the Senate Judiciary Committee’s markup agenda:
“Since the original passage of ECPA in 1986, a lot has changed, especially when it comes to how we communicate and how we store our private documents and thoughts. Email and cloud storage have become a standard part of American life, and our privacy laws need to be updated.”
“Sen. Leahy and I have attempted to bring before this committee a bill that does one simple thing: eliminate the 180-day rule that suggests that our privacy interests expire when an email turns six months old. This is a change that has such wide support that it passed out of the House 419-0. It has brought together a coalition that includes groups such as the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, the ACLU, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the tech community.”
“Unfortunately, some Senators on the committee have decided late in the day that this bill should be a vehicle to move an unrelated and controversial expansion of the use of national security letters by the FBI. Such an expansion would swallow up the protections this bill offers to the American people. While there are other concerns we had hoped to negotiate, the national security letter amendment is something I cannot in good conscience have attached to this bill.”
“So, with great reluctance, I have requested that Chairman Grassley withdraw the ECPA Amendments Act from the markup agenda until such time as we can proceed without risking that this bill actually decrease the privacy of our citizens.”

Title: Bipartisan Coalition of Senators File 'Due Process Guarantee Act’ Amendment to NDAA
Date: June 7, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Tom Udall (D-NM), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act Monday as an amendment to the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This amendment will protect the Due Process rights of American citizens and lawful permanent residents in the United States by prohibiting their indefinite detention under any general authorization of military force or declaration of war.  Previous provisions in the Defense Authorization Act have placed Americans’ Fifth Amendment rights at risk and set dangerous legal precedence for the future.
“Twenty-first century warfare has presented unique legal issues to our federal government," Lee said, "but we cannot sacrifice the core values and protections of the Constitution and Bill of Rights for any reason. This amendment guarantees that U.S. persons in the United States cannot be held indefinitely without due process of law - one of the principles upon which our nation was founded - while still allowing the federal government to have the intelligence gathering and law enforcement tools necessary to protect our country and keep our deployed service members safe."
This amendment does not undermine the ability of the United States to capture enemy combatants on foreign battlefields under the law of war.  Similar language was adopted with significant bipartisan support on the FY 2013 NDAA, but was removed in conference.

Title: Sens. Lee, Klobuchar, Blumenthal Send Letter to DOJ, DOT About Airline Surcharges
Date: June 7, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent a letter to Transportation Department Secretary Foxx and Attorney General Loretta Lynch urging them to investigate the potential anti-competitive implications of comments made by Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr.
“On June 8, 2015, at a panel of the IATA conference with more than 100 executives from competing airlines in the audience, Mr. Spohr announced that Lufthansa was planning to impose an $18 surcharge on price comparison websites,” the letter reads. Later questioned about other airline reactions to his statement, Mr. Spohr said, “It's a first step and I believe others will follow.”
“Lufthansa’s conduct, encouraging competitors collectively representing the vast majority of the market to follow Lufthansa’s lead in raising prices, raises the question of whether they have run afoul of the Sherman Act,” the letter explains.
Sens. Lee, Klobuchar, and Blumenthal called on DOT and DOJ to “thoroughly investigate this matter and, if you find that there has been a violation, to address it with an appropriate remedy.”
Lee and Klobuchar are the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.

Title: Lee NDAA Amendment Calls for Study of Selective Service Needs
Date: May 26, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) filed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act Thursday that would strike a requirement that women register for the selective service and replace it with a requirement for the Department of Defense to issue a report on the current and future national security needs by July 1, 2017.
“Forcing women to register for the draft would be a sea change not only for our Armed Services but culturally as well,” Lee said. “I simply have not seen enough research from the Department of Defense on why this is needed or how it would work,” Lee continued. “My amendment would not prevent any woman from earning a combat role, but it would require the Pentagon to study whether we need to force women to fight.”
The decision by the Department of Defense last year to open all Military Occupational Specialties to service-members regardless of gender created a legal dilemma for Congress, as Rostker vs. Goldberg (1981) found that selective service was constitutional because of the combat restrictions on women’s service. Lee’s amendment would also ensure that Congress is the only branch of government that can change the application and interpretation of the Military Selective Service Act.
The amendment is cosponsored Sens. Ted Crus (R-TX), James Inhofe (R-OK), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).

Title: Senators Demand DOJ Cease Investigation Into Opponents of President Obama’s Energy Policies
Date: May 26, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), David Perdue (R-GA), and David Vitter (R-LA) sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch Thursday demanding that the Department of Justice end its use of law enforcement resources against political opponents of President Obama’s energy agenda.
“These actions provide disturbing confirmation that government officials at all levels are threatening to wield the sword of law enforcement to silence debate on climate change,” the letter reads. “As you well know, initiating criminal prosecution for a private entity’s opinions on climate change is a blatant violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.”
The letter goes on to demand that Attorney General Lynch confirm that all investigations into any private individual’s views on climate change end within 14 days and promise not to initiate any future such investigations.
“Threatening prosecution of those who dare to challenge the most outlandish scaremongering by climate activists strikes at the very heart of the Free Speech protections on which this nation was founded,” Lee said. “Issuing subpoenas to harass researchers and academics with whom they have communicated, as some state attorneys general offices have done, shows a basic disregard for Americans' Freedom of Association. The public expects us to prevent such abuses, not perpetrate them. It is our responsibility to contain the inevitable chilling effects by calling for an end to any consideration by the Department of Justice of such harassment at once.”
“Freedom of thought and inquiry is at the very heart of liberty,” Cruz said. “Sadly, the Obama administration and its allies in state attorney general offices across the country are threatening to use the power of government to intimidate and ultimately silence companies and researchers who do not agree with the government’s opinions about the allegedly harmful effects of climate change and what should be done about it. This is an abuse of power and a direct assault on the First Amendment. The Obama Justice Department should immediately cease any further consideration of such action and should instead do everything in its power to protect the freedom of thought of all Americans.”
“I have serious concerns any time that the Department of Justice uses its power to repress constitutionally protected speech and open dialogue on any public policy issue," Perdue said. "Given the unprecedented politicization of the Obama Justice Department, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s oversight responsibilities have become more important than ever before. There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated investigations by the Department of Justice.”
“Unnecessary government intrusion of private citizens’ lives is an unfortunate characteristic of the reign of the Obama Administration,” Vitter said. “It is contemptible for the Justice Department to target and threaten individual American citizens and private or non-profit organizations in pursuit of its far-left environmental agenda.”

Title: Lee Unveils Article I Regulatory Budget Act
Date: May 25, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) held an event with Reps. Mark Walker (R-NC), Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), and Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) to unveil legislation designed to restore direct, accountable congressional control over the federal regulatory system.
The Article I Regulatory Budget Reform Act would, for the first time, require Congress to vote on the total regulatory burden each federal agency may impose on the American people each year. It would require a budget for federal regulatory costs similar to Congress’s annual budget for taxes and spending.
Under the discipline of a regulatory budget, Congress would be directly responsible for the size and scope of the regulatory state. Executive agencies could still issue and enforce their rules, but only so long as their impact fits within the regulatory-cost limits established by Congress.
In addition to Senator Lee, original co-sponsors to the Senate bill include Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). The House version, introduced by Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC), is co-sponsored by Chairman Hensarling (R-TX), and Reps. Dave Brat (R-VA), Mia Love (R-UT), John Ratcliffe (R-TX), and Berry Loudermilk (R-GA).
Senator Lee’s remarks as prepared for deliver are available below:
Thank you, Mike. And thanks to all of you for being here. It’s always great to be back at Hillsdale’s Kirby Center, and it’s wonderful to be here with all of you this morning.
It was almost four months ago that we gathered here, in front of this inspiring portrait, to launch the Article I Project – a new network of House and Senate conservatives working together on a new agenda of government reform and congressional rehabilitation.
The starting point for that agenda is the simple observation that the federal government is broken, and congressional weakness is to blame.
But it’s important not to conflate a broken federal government with an inoperative federal government. Likewise, we must be careful not to assume that congressional weakness is equivalent to congressional innocence.
Indeed, the problem that we’re here to address today – the problem of our hyperactive Executive Branch bureaucracy writing upwards of 95 percent of all new federal “laws” without winning a single vote in Congress or at the ballot box – was primarily created by the Legislative Branch for its own convenience.
At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. After all, why would Congress willfully relinquish its legislative authority exclusively granted to it by Article I of the Constitution?
And more to the point, if the lawmaking powers now exercised by the Executive Branch were not usurped by bureaucratic agents, why is it so common to hear members of Congress rail against the federal bureaucracy and accuse its rule-writing agencies of executive overreach?
To understand why members of Congress would intentionally empower bureaucrats to legislate for them, we need to recognize that lawmaking is not just a power – it’s also a responsibility.
Legislating is hard work. This was the lesson of the classic Schoolhouse Rock episode, “I’m Just a Bill” – which, I should note for all the young people in the room, is available on YouTube.
In the animated video, a walking and talking legislative bill sitting on the steps of Capitol Hill explains to a young boy how laws are made in the federal government.
The process amounts to a “long, long journey” through Congress’s parallel committee systems. And it involves a “long, long wait” as members of the House and Senate amend and debate the bill in order to build the consensus needed for a majority to vote for it and send it to the president, who can either sign the bill into law or veto it.
Zeroing in on the moral of the story, the boy finally asks, “It’s not easy to become a law, is it?”
Nor should we expect it to be. There are 535 members of Congress representing some 318 million Americans living in thousands of communities spread across 50 sovereign states. It’s not easy for a group that large and diverse to agree on anything – let alone what the nation’s laws should be.
Legislating is also risky: if, after all that work, your constituents dislike the legislation you wrote or supported, they may vote you out of office the next chance they get!
Over the past century, successive generations of elected policymakers in Congress have sought to escape this stringent accountability inherent in constitutional lawmaking.
Instead of writing laws containing specific rules of action and distinct standards of legality, most major bills passed by Congress simply establish aspirational guidelines, while delegating to the Executive Branch the power to determine the specifics.
For the rule-writing bureaucrats, these open-ended laws are gifts that keep on giving. For instance, in the years since Congress first passed the Clean Air Act in 1977, federal bureaucrats have used the law to enact more than 13,500 pages of regulations – roughly 30 pages for every page of legislative text.
But for the American people, this kind of government without consent is a violation of the social compact at the heart of our Republic and exactly why they no longer trust the federal government.
Earning back the American people’s trust is the chief objective of the Article I Project’s agenda to re-empower Congress.
And it’s why today we’re introducing the Article I Regulatory Budget Act – a bill that will put the Legislative Branch back in charge of lawmaking and, by extension, put the American people back in charge of Washington.
I will let my colleagues dig into the details of the legislation, and I look forward to the input of the esteemed panelists that we’ll hear from later this morning.
If you’re interested in learning more about this reform and the ideas behind it, I would encourage you to pick up a copy of the A1P policy brief, “Leashing Leviathan: The Case for a Congressional Regulatory Budget.”

Title: Senators Commit to Oversight of Consolidation in Agri-Chem Industry
Date: May 23, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today issued the following statements in response to press reports of a potential merger between Bayer and Monsanto. The $62 billion deal, which would combine two of the largest companies in crop sciences and agricultural chemicals, comes in the wake of proposed mergers between Dow and DuPont and ChemChina and Syngenta.
“The accelerating trend of consolidation in the agricultural space should be of deep concern to American consumers, touching as it does on the competitiveness of the industry that provides most of our nation’s food,” said Lee. “As Chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I will be undertaking close oversight of these deals and the antitrust enforcement agencies’ review of them to ensure that competition remains vibrant in one of the largest and most important sectors of the American economy.”
“The current wave of consolidations across our economy raises many concerns for American consumers and why I have fought—and will continue to fight— hard to promote competition across all sectors and industries,” said Klobuchar. “As Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I take seriously my responsibility to provide oversight over potential consolidations and to ensure that antitrust laws are vigorously enforced to protect competition.”
“For some time, concerns have been raised that the recent proposed seed company mergers could create a domino effect and consolidate the industry,” said Grassley. “The Bayer-Monsanto talks only heighten the possibility that the industry, farmers and consumers could be adversely impacted by this consolidation trend. The Justice Department’s role to ensure a competitive marketplace is even more critical as it studies how these proposed deals play into the big picture in the seed and chemical industry. I’ll be watching closely for any developments that may negatively impact Iowa farmers and consumers.”

WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, May 25 at 10 AM EDT, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) will be joined by Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), Mark Walker (R-NC) and Dave Brat (R-VA) to discuss the Article I Project’s Regulatory Budget Act.
The Regulatory Budget Act would, for the first time, require Congress to vote on the total regulatory burden each federal agency may impose on the American people each year – a budget for federal regulatory costs to mirror Congress’s annual budget for taxes and spending.
Just as Congress binds the federal government to a

budget every year, it has the power – and we believe the obligation – to maintain an annual
regulatory
budget, so that the American people know, and can determine, the cost of the rules and regulations with which they must comply.

Title: Statement from Senator Mike Lee on the 2017 NDAA
Date: May 12, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee joined two of his colleagues in voting against the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in the Senate Armed Services Committee. Now that the NDAA legislation has advanced from the closed-door deliberations of the Committee to the Senate floor for further consideration and debate, Senator Lee is hopeful that he and his colleagues will have the time and opportunity to work with the Department of Defense and Military and Veterans Service Organizations before these reforms are passed into law.
“I commend Chairman John McCain and Ranking Member Jack Reed for addressing difficult efficiency and spending issues at the Department of Defense in this bill, but I could not, in good conscience, vote in favor of the legislation because it includes two provisions that I believe are misguided and ill-advised,” Sen. Lee said. “First, the bill requires women between the ages of 18 and 25 to register for the Selective Service. This is a highly consequential – and, for many American families, a deeply controversial – decision that deserves to be resolved by Congress after a robust and transparent debate in front of the American people, instead of buried in an embargoed document that is passed every year to fund military pay and benefits. Second, the bill authorizes the continuation of the Syria Train and Equip program, which was suspended last year after expending hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to train only four or five fighters and finance the purchase of weapons that were ultimately seized by Al Nusra, the Syrian Al Qaeda affiliate. I firmly believe that the American counter-ISIS strategy must be reconsidered from the top-down and that we should not fund failing programs.”
Although the two amendments that Senator Lee offered to strike these provisions of the Chairman’s bill were defeated, several other amendments that he offered were incorporated into the final bill passed out of the committee. Those amendments include supporting the National Guard’s retention of Apache helicopter battalions, requiring the Department of Defense to put forth plans to increase European countries’ defense contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, requiring any Department of Defense reorganization to include senior positions specifically for logistics and sustainment services, and mandating a study on the potential sale of excess ballistic missile motors for use in commercial services. The bill also contained authorities aimed at alleviating some of the high-skilled worker shortfalls at military facilities across the country, including the Ogden Air Logistics Complex in Ogden, UT.
When this bill comes to the Senate floor, Senator Lee will continue to work to ensure that our service members and their families are appropriately compensated for their patriotic sacrifices and adequately equipped with the funding and provisions they need to protect our country, and he will continue to advance reforms aimed at preventing the United States from becoming embroiled in military actions around the world that do not advance our national security interests.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Utah lawmakers’ hand-delivered a letter to the White House requesting a meeting with President Obama on potential use of the Antiquities Act to create a national monument in Utah. Before delivering the letter, members of the Utah Delegation met with White House officials to discuss public land issues.
Letter signatures include Utah Governor Gary Herbert (R-UT), Senators Orin Hatch (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT), Representatives Rob Bishop (UT-01), Jason Chaffetz (UT-03), Chris Stewart (UT-02), and Mia Love (UT-04), and San Juan County Commissioner Rebecca Benally.
Excerpts from the letter:
“To further communicate our strong opposition against the unilateral creation of a national monument in the State of Utah, we respectfully request the opportunity to personally meet with you to discuss our basis for opposition.”
“In a February meeting with the National Governors Association, you stated that open lines of communication are needed when discussing national monument designations. To that end, we believe a meeting involving you, Governor Gary Herbert, the Congressional delegation, and Utah’s only elected Navajo official is critical to successful communication and planning.”
Background:
President Obama is being pressed by environmental groups to use the Antiquities Act to designate 1.9 million acres of Bears Ears in southern Utah as a national monument. Earlier this year a draft of the Public Lands Initiative (PLI) was announced as a balanced approach to land conservation. Many stakeholders, including conservation groups, continue to support PLI as the preferred alternative to a national monument.
Find the full text of the letter below:
April 29, 2016
Dear Mr. President,
It is widely known that you are considering use of the Antiquities Act to declare a national monument in the State of Utah. We have previously written to you expressing our opposition to this action. While we appreciate the Secretary of the Interior’s response to our letter, we believe it was an inadequate response, as the Department of the Interior does not possess the authority to declare a national monument.
To further communicate our strong opposition against the unilateral creation of a national monument in the State of Utah, we respectfully request the opportunity to personally meet with you to discuss our basis for opposition.
A meeting of this nature is supported by your recent public statements. In a February meeting with the National Governors Association, you stated that open lines of communication are needed when discussing national monument designations. To that end, we believe a meeting involving you, Governor Gary Herbert, the Congressional delegation, and Utah’s only elected Navajo official is critical to successful communication and planning.
Finally, we hope a recent meeting we had with your staff will result in a productive dialogue regarding the Public Lands Initiative (PLI). The PLI is a balanced legislative approach to land management in eastern Utah.  If passed, the PLI will establish greater land-use certainty and conserve more than four million acres of federal land.  Many groups, including conservation groups, are still at the table providing feedback and comments on the draft PLI.  The same draft was given to your staff on January 14, 2016 but thus far feedback has not been provided.
Thank you for your consideration. Collaborative planning is essential in the land management arena, and we look forward to meeting with you.

Title: Sentencing Reform & Corrections Act Expands Bipartisan Support
Date: April 28, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – The bipartisan authors of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act (S. 2123) today announced revisions to the legislation to broaden bipartisan support for criminal justice reform. The bill is led by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Assistant Democratic Leader Dick Durbin, Assistant Majority Leader John Cornyn, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy, and Senators Mike Lee and Sheldon Whitehouse.
The revised bill is now cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 37 senators and supported by a broad and diverse array of organizations and interests. In a recent letter of support from the
National District Attorneys Association
, the largest association of prosecutors in the country, the organization’s president wrote, “As a result of months of changes and good faith negotiations, our organization feels the latest version of the bill strikes the appropriate balance between targeting the highest level drug traffickers plaguing our communities, while simultaneously decreasing crime rates and addressing the burgeoning prison population.” The bill enjoys support from coalitions representing more than 400 groups and organizations across the political spectrum.
The revised legislation leaves intact important tools to help prosecutors take down large criminal operations, and still reduces minimum penalties for low-level, non-violent offenders. The bill still expands the existing safety-valve provision and creates a second safety-valve so that judges are able to exercise greater discretion in sentencing for low-level, non-violent drug traffickers. And the bill maintains two new mandatory minimums for offenses involving interstate domestic violence and providing weapons to prohibited countries or designated terrorists. Importantly, the revised bill also leaves in place important prison reforms that encourage qualifying inmates to earn reduced sentences through recidivism reduction programs.
After seeking input from Senate colleagues, the authors fine-tuned some provisions to ensure violent criminals do not benefit from reduced sentence opportunities established by the bill. It now expressly excludes offenders convicted of any serious violent felony from retroactive early release. It also substantially limits the changes to the firearm provisions, striking all changes to the Armed Career Criminal Act. The revised bill also establishes a mandatory sentencing enhancement for offenses involving fentanyl, a dangerous opioid responsible for thousands of drug overdoses and deaths.
The revised bill also provides greater opportunity for relief for low-level, non-violent drug offenders. Prior misdemeanors and other minor drug offenses are excluded from an offender’s criminal history calculation for purposes of the safety valve. The bill makes clear that minor, non-violent participants in large drug conspiracies can be eligible for relief under the “second safety valve.” And a defendant who cooperates with law enforcement may not be subject to an enhanced sentence unless the defendant was involved in any acts of violence. Finally, outdated, non-violent narcotics convictions cannot serve as predicate offenses for the enhanced mandatory minimum for repeat offenders.
The bill’s authors released the following statements:
“After nearly a year of bipartisan collaboration, we developed a comprehensive plan that goes a long way to address over-incarceration, reduce recidivism, and save taxpayer dollars, all while preserving tools to keep violent and career criminals out of our communities. We’ve taken that same proven strategy of good-faith negotiations to our Senate colleagues to fine tune and improve this proposal. In doing so, the bill has gained even broader bipartisan support. I’m grateful for the work of the other authors and all of my colleagues for their willingness to come together on a historic bill worth of consideration by the full Senate,”
Grassley said
.
“This legislation represents more than three years of work on criminal justice reform, and months of bipartisan negotiations with my colleagues. We believe this bill can pass the Senate with a majority of Democrats and majority of Republicans supporting it. The United States incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country on earth. Mandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent. In reality they have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety. Given tight budgets and overcrowded prison cells, our country must reform these outdated and ineffective laws that have cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. This is the best chance in a generation to reform our federal drug sentencing laws. We cannot squander it,”
Durbin said.
“By preserving and expanding important mandatory minimums for violent offenders while preparing low-level inmates to reenter society and break the cycle of recidivism, this legislation builds on reforms in states like Texas that have successfully rehabilitated prisoners, reduced crime rates, and saved taxpayer dollars. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue to build support for this commonsense measure on both sides of the aisle,”
Cornyn Said.
“It has taken a long time, but I am glad that a bipartisan group of Senators has joined our efforts to improve the fairness of our criminal justice system. Now, the Senate must vote. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act has the support of a majority of Senators, and it is an important first step in correcting the costly mistakes we made when we enacted reactionary mandatory minimums sentences. Real people, like Weldon Angelos, are paying with decades of their lives. We must keep pushing and see that this bill is enacted and continue working toward additional reforms,”
Leahy said.
“To be effective, a criminal justice system must be seen as legitimate. And for too long our federal sentencing laws have required punishments that just don’t fit the crime. More and more of our fellow senators are recognizing this mismatch between crimes and penalties and this bill takes a big step in fixing the problem. I am grateful for the feedback we have received from our colleagues on this bill, and I believe it is a better product today thanks to the efforts of those joining us as cosponsors today,"
Lee said.
“This new bill modifies sensible sentencing reforms and maintains sensible approaches to reducing recidivism that have worked well in states like Rhode Island. As amended, it will still help reduce swelling prison populations and burdensome incarceration costs, and help inmates become productive members of our communities upon release. Since these changes to the bill have allowed us to attract even more bipartisan support, I urge Leader McConnell to take it up,”
Whitehouse said.
“We maintain the tools law enforcement needs to continue making sure that the worst drug traffickers and violent criminals stay off of our streets. We also provide flexibility in sentencing for those offenders who deserve it. I’m proud this legislation, which was the product of months of negotiation, is picking up additional support from law enforcement as well as Republicans and Democrats in Congress,”
Graham said.
“Months of hard work and bipartisan collaboration have yielded an even broader base of support for the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, and I believe it will pass the Senate if Senator McConnell brings it for a vote. This legislation would expand the number of people with nonviolent convictions who would benefit from a sentencing reduction while ensuring public safety. Mass incarceration is costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every year, draining our economy of potential, compromising public safety, hurting our children, and disproportionately affecting communities of color. Passing the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act would take a long-overdue step forward and help make our federal justice system more just. The time to act is now,”
Booker said.
“There is bipartisan agreement that we need to make serious reforms to our criminal justice system, and we need to make them soon. We urge our Republican colleagues who haven’t yet signed on to this cause to give careful thought to the issue and join with us in moving this bill forward,”
Schumer said.

Title: Lee, Leahy Comment On House Passage of the Bipartisan Email Privacy Act
Date: April 27, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) reseased the following statement following the House of Representatives' 419-0 vote to pass the Email Privacy Act:
“Today’s 419-0 House vote for the Email Privacy Act is an historic step toward updating our privacy laws for the digital age.  It should go without saying that law enforcement agents should have to get a warrant to read Americans’ emails or retrieve their sensitive information from the cloud – yet that is not what our statutes currently require.  It is long past time to reassure the American people that their online communications are protected from warrantless searches.  The Email Privacy Act does just that.  As today’s House vote shows, it is that rare bill that garners support from the full range of the political spectrum, and that can become law even in an election year.  The companion bill that we introduced in the Senate last year has broad support with more than 25 cosponsors, including senior members from both parties.  Now that the House has passed this bill by a vote of 419-0, it’s time for the Senate act.  We urge the Senate to take up and pass this bipartisan, common-sense legislation without delay.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Urge Careful Consideration of Proposed SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev Merger
Date: April 21, 2016

Content:
Last December, Lee and Klobuchar held an Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on Anheuser-Busch InBev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller for over $103 billion; the hearing examined how the proposed merger of the world’s two biggest beer producers would impact competition and consumers across the country
WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, today urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) to carefully consider the proposed SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev merger. Last December, Lee and Klobuchar held a hearing on Anheuser-Busch InBev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller for over $103 billion. The hearing examined how the proposed merger of the world’s two biggest beer producers would impact competition and consumers across the country.
“We are concerned about any consolidation in the beer market that would make it harder for small brewers to make their products available to consumers, and in particular any significant increases in the acquisition or control of distributors by large brewers,”
wrote the lawmakers.
“The Department of Justice must be confident that the merger does not alter the incentives or abilities of ABI or MillerCoors to foreclose craft or import brewers’ access to distribution. If the Justice Department has concerns with the merger, we urge careful consideration of conditions to ensure adequate protections for competition and consumers.”
The full text of the lawmaker’s letter is below:
Dear Ms. Hesse:
We write to you regarding the proposed acquisition of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice. While we take no position about the legality of the merger under the antitrust laws, we believe it affords an opportunity to raise important competition issues that the Department should carefully review.
The beer market in the United States, unlike many other industries, has seen a significant increase in competition over the past forty years. In 1978, there were fewer than 50 brewers in the United States. As of 2015, we have over 4,100 craft brewers. In the last 20 years, craft brewers’ sales have grown from one percent of the beer market to 11 percent. This competition is good for consumers and encourages the larger brewers to innovate and offer a greater variety of products. Consolidation in this market should occur only if it does not disrupt this thriving competition.
The success of craft brewers depends on access to retail markets, specifically through wholesale distribution. The current strong and independent distribution system offers opportunities to craft beers, not just the large brewers, and has helped create the most diverse beer market in the world, with thousands of breweries working through independent distributors to ensure access to market. We are concerned about any consolidation in the beer market that would make it harder for small brewers to make their products available to consumers, and in particular any significant increases in the acquisition or control of distributors by large brewers. The Department of Justice must be confident that the merger does not alter the incentives or abilities of ABI or MillerCoors to foreclose craft or import brewers’ access to distribution.
On December 8, 2015, we held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights in order to hear from brewers and others in the marketplace about the potential impact of this merger. The CEOs of ABI and Molson Coors were adamant that the merger would not harm the competitive landscape of the beer market in the United States. With regards to beer distribution, Carlos Brito of ABI stated that “we do not expect any changes to the Anheuser-Busch distribution system as a result of the combination or divestiture,” and Mark Hunter of Molson Coors said that “we have no intention of purchasing other distributors.”
We appreciate the candor of those witnesses. If the divestiture eliminates competitive concerns, the merger should be approved. As with any merger consent decree, the conditions must protect competition. At the March 9, 2016, antitrust oversight hearing, you referenced the 2013 ABI acquisition of Grupo Modelo. The final order included conditions to address Department of Justice concerns about that acquisition’s potential impact on distribution. The Division should consider whether there needs to be conditions to address similar issues here.
This is an important merger that we are sure is receiving serious attention by the Justice Department. As you review the proposed merger and divestitures, it is important to ensure that the statements made by Carlos Brito and Mark Hunter during the December 8 hearing accurately reflect the framework and impact of the merger. If the Justice Department has concerns with the merger, we urge careful consideration of conditions to ensure adequate protections for competition and consumers.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Press FTC On Contact Lens Market
Date: April 18, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, sent a letter today to the Federal Trade Commission urging the agency to maintain vigilance over competition in the market for contact lenses.
“The rights of contact lens consumers are being repeatedly and openly violated by prescribers who refuse to comply with the FTC’s Contact Lens Rule, which requires doctors to give patients a copy of their prescription so that patients can choose for themselves where they purchase their contact lenses,” said Lee.
“It is essential that consumers be made aware of their rights, and that the FTC vigorously defend and enforce those rights. Our letter also asks the FTC to revisit its now decade-old study of competition in the contact lens industry. There are many concerning trends that deserve attention, including the cozy relationship between manufacturers and prescribers, the requirement for a brand to be listed on a contact lens prescription, and the inability of generic alternatives to come to market. It is paramount that our laws and antitrust enforcement policy encourage competition rather than facilitate kickbacks and create barriers to entry that raise prices for consumers.”

Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah)
On the House Judiciary Committee Approving the Bipartisan Email Privacy Act
April 13, 2016
“Last year we partnered with Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers to protect Americans’ privacy in the USA FREEDOM Act, and now we applaud them for their leadership in moving the Email Privacy Act through the House Judiciary Committee. This bill has unprecedented support from all corners of Congress and for good reason: It ensures that the same privacy protections that apply to documents stored in our homes extend to our emails, photos, and information stored in the cloud. These critical updates to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act will bring that law into the 21st century. The broad, bipartisan coalition that cuts across industry, civil society, and academia deserves credit for their members’ tireless work to move this bill. Congress has waited far too long to enact these reforms, but we are one step closer today. We urge the full House to pass this bill soon so the Senate can do the same. The American people deserve a law that matches today’s digital age.”

Title: Sens. Lee and Cruz Take Aim at DOJ’s Operation Choke Point
Date: April 13, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) today introduced
legislation
fighting the Obama administration’s Operation Choke Point, a Department of Justice (DOJ) initiative that unconstitutionally sought to choke off access to banking services for sellers of firearms and other lawful business enterprises. This legislation sponsored by Sens. Cruz and Lee serves as a companion bill to U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer’s (R-Mo.) Financial Institution Customer Protection Act (H.R. 766), which passed the House with bipartisan support in February.
“Our right to bear arms – a right granted by God and protected by the Constitution – is fundamental to the protection of all our other rights,”
Sen. Lee said.
“An executive branch bent on taking away this right, through any administrative means necessary, is a danger to all Americans. That is why I am proud to co-sponsor the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which would end the federal government’s ability to abuse financial regulations to target firearm proprietors like they did during Operation Choke Point.”
“Under President Obama’s reign, the DOJ has abandoned its longstanding tradition of staying out of politics and has instead become a partisan arm of the White House,”
Sen. Cruz said.
“The Obama administration initiated Operation Choke Point to punish law-abiding small businesses that don’t align with the President’s political leanings. The DOJ should not be abusing its power by trying to bankrupt American citizens for exercising their constitutional rights. I am proud to stand with Sen. Lee and Rep. Luetkemeyer to stop this insidious manipulation by the administration and look forward to sending this legislation to the President’s desk.”
“I am pleased that my colleagues, Sens. Cruz and Lee, recognized the importance of the bipartisan
Financial Institution Customer Protection Act
and filed legislation that is identical to what the House of Representatives passed earlier this year,”
Rep. Luetkemeyer
said. “Today’s action confirms that Americans, all across the country, are speaking up after having been affected by Operation Choke Point. The Senators recognize the need for greater transparency in the Department of Justice and federal banking agencies. Operation Choke Point runs contrary to who we are as Americans, and I want to thank Sens. Cruz and Lee for joining me in this effort. I look forward to working with them to encourage the Senate to bring this bill to the floor in the very near future.”
Last November in a full Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Cruz sharply
questioned
the Hon. Stuart Delery, a nominee for U.S. Associate Attorney General, who approved Operation Choke Point and has since resigned from his post.
The full text of the Senate version of the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act of 2016 is available
here
and additional details of the bill are available below:
· The Financial Institution Customer Protection Act of 2016 would prohibit any federal banking agency from ordering banks to terminate customer accounts unless the regulator has a material reason other than “reputational risk,” the term used by the Obama Administration to identify and target “high risk” businesses like firearms and ammunition sellers, pawnshops, and short-term lenders.
· The bill also includes a section that amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), which federal agencies have manipulated to implement Operation Choke Point. The change ensures that the original intent of the law is preserved, so that fraud against or by financial institutions can be penalized.
Today, The Daily Signal covered Sens. Cruz’s and Lee’s efforts to push back against Operation Choke Point. That article can be found

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Praise DOJ’s Comments on Canadian Pacific’s Proposed Voting Trust
Date: April 8, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Lee and Klobuchar, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights today issued the following statements on the Department of Justice’s determination that Canadian Pacific’s proposed voting trust “risks irreversible harm” to competition.
“I commend and thank the Department of Justice for weighing in on the side of competition in the railway industry,” said Lee. “The Department has confirmed my belief that Canadian Pacific’s proposed voting trust runs counter to long-standing sound merger policy by ‘scrambling the eggs’ before a review of the acquisition has been completed. Doing so would mean that any harm to competition of consumers would be almost impossible to cure.”
“I appreciate that the Department of Justice took Senator Lee’s and my request to weigh-in with the Surface Transportation Board on this important issue. The Anti-Trust Division has confirmed my concerns that the proposed voting trust would be bad for competition and bad for consumers. It is my hope that the Surface Transportation Board will listen to the Department of Justice’s thoughtful analysis,” said Klobuchar. “As Assistant Attorney General Baer said so pointedly at the Antitrust Oversight Hearing, the proposed voting trust ‘strikes me as letting the fox into the chicken coop, subject to the investigation later why there are so many feathers laying around.”

Title: Senate, House Leaders Introduce Bill To Restore Regulatory Accountability Through Judicial Review
Date: March 17, 2016

Content:
Washington, DC—Legislation to restore accountability to the regulatory process was introduced Thursday by a coalition of lawmakers eager to ensure proper judicial review. The bill, called the "Separation of Powers Restoration Act" would empower the courts, not agencies, to interpret all questions of law, including both statutes and regulations.
The Senate bill was introduced by Senators Hatch (UT), Grassley (IA), Lee (UT), Lankford (OK), Flake (AZ), Inhofe (OK), Tillis (NC), Cruz (TX), Cornyn (R-TX), Sasse (NE), and Sullivan (AK).
The House bill was introduced by Representatives Ratcliffe (TX), Goodlatte (VA), Marino (PA), Chaffetz (UT), Buck (CO), Yoho (FL), S. King (IA), Bryne (AL), Babin (TX), M. Brooks (AL), Brat (VA), Love (UT), Salmon (AZ), Hensarling (TX), Rouzer (NC), Bishop (MI), Palmer (AL), Messer (IN), Mulvaney (SC), Labrador (ID), Trott (MI), Mullin (OK), Sensenbrenner (WI), Schweikert (AZ), DeSantis (FL), Loudermilk (GA), Issa (CA), Westerman (AR), Burgess (TX), Culberson (TX), Lummis (WY), Walker (NC), Olson (TX), J. Smith (MO), Kelly (PA), Renacci (OH), Gosar (AZ), McMorris Rodgers (WA), LaMalfa (CA), D. Collins (GA), Graves (GA), Franks (AZ), Farenthold (TX), Griffith (VA), L. Smith (TX), and Chabot (OH).
"The federal regulatory process is broken. Washington bureaucrats impose expensive and often unnecessary rules that strain family budgets and impede our ability to create jobs,” Senator Hatch said. “In this environment, the courts stand as the only truly independent check on out-of-control regulators, but judicial deference to the agencies undercuts the courts’ ability to hold the government accountable to the law. Our bill restores accountability to the regulatory process by ensuring that the courts say what the law is, not what the agencies wish the law would be.”
“Regulators have taken advantage of the courts’ deference under Chevron to shoehorn the law into their own political agenda, expanding their authority well beyond congressional intent. But the Constitution’s separation of powers makes clear that it is the responsibility of the courts – not the bureaucracy – to interpret the law. And they should do so independently.  This bill reasserts the clear lines between the courts’ role in interpreting the law, and the Executive Branch’s role in enforcing the law.  By doing so, it takes a strong step toward reining in the regulators,” Chairman Grassley said.
“In practice Chevron deference has become a direct threat to the rule of law and the moral underpinnings of America’s constitutional order,” Senator Lee said. “The Separation of Powers Restoration Act of 2016 will restore that balance by bringing back traditional judicial review of administrative actions.”
“This bill addresses the core problem of executive agencies inventing new law on the American people rather than applying existing law from the American people,” said Senator Lankford. “Deference to the executive branch creates an imbalance in our constitutional system’s balance of powers, favoring centralized executive power over the legislative and judicial powers. The result is that the vast majority of laws burdening everyday Americans come not from politically accountable officials in Congress, but from unelected bureaucrats in federal agencies. Through several hearings before my Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee, it has become apparent that the Chevron and Auer doctrines harm everyday Americans. This is not how the Founders intended for government to work. To restore Congress’ and the courts’ role in our constitutional system, we need the Separation of Powers Restoration Act to ensure that agencies don’t get a blank check to make and interpret law.”
“This bill will help restore the proper balance of power in our constitutional system,” said Senator Flake. “In today’s world of vast executive agencies it is important for courts to provide serious review of actions taken by these agencies and that is exactly what this legislation will do.”
“At the core of our unique system of government are three equal branches – the legislative, executive, and judiciary,” said Senator Inhofe. “However, under the Obama administration, executive branch overreach has upset that balance.  The Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly been among the worst offenders.  The American people can no longer afford EPA’s costly and lawless regulatory actions premised on the notion of agency deference.  This ‘just trust us’ mentality is not enough.   This bill is an important step to restore the necessary balance among the branches and protect the American people from excessive executive overreach.”
“One of the biggest challenges facing our nation is a large and cumbersome regulatory environment that negatively affects hardworking American families and business, and impedes our nation’s economic growth and potential,” said Senator Tillis. “After eight years of unprecedented executive bureaucratic overreach, this legislation takes necessary steps to hold unelected bureaucrats and regulators accountable by restoring the proper separation of powers to the legislative and judicial branches.”
“At a time when runaway executive agencies are more unwieldy than ever, empowered by a lawless president, Congress must act to reassert and restore its appropriate place as a coequal branch of government,” said Senator Cruz. "It is encouraging to see members in both houses working together to stop unelected bureaucrats, who are wreaking havoc on our nation's economy as well as the Constitution. This bill reverses the trend of enabling bureaucracy at the expense of Congress and the courts.”
“Washington’s unelected bureaucracy is not a super-legislature but too often it acts like a fourth branch of government,” said Senator Sasse. “This bill takes an important step to restore the Constitution's system of three separate branches of government with specifically defined duties on behalf of the American people.”
“When courts rely on the Chevron doctrine, congressional authority is undermined," said Senator Sullivan. "As the power of the regulation nation grows, the rule of law is increasingly ignored. It’s time for Congress to act. This simple change in the law will reinforce the constitutionally mandated division of authority between the three branches of government.”
“The endless stream of rules and regulations being rolled out by federal agencies has real consequences for real people all across the country,” said Congressman Ratcliffe. “Unelected federal bureaucrats are not accountable to the American people and can’t be voted out of office; yet, they wield immense power to impose regulations that have the force of law. I’m grateful to be a part of the solution today as we introduce this important legislation to rein in an administrative state that has been allowed to wield immense lawmaking power outside of the will of the Constitution.”
"Today's federal administrative state is an institution unforeseen by the Framers of our Constitution, that is rapidly mushrooming out of control,” said Chairman Goodlatte. “This overgrown bureaucracy is tipping our system of checks and balances away from the legislative and judicial branches, and towards a stronger, emboldened, and overreaching executive. The precedent set by Chevron has been a catalyst for a runaway administrative state, and we are undertaking a strong, bicameral effort to bring balance back to our federal government.”
“I am grateful to my colleagues in the House and Senate for their efforts on this bill,” said Subcommittee Chairman Marino. “Our Founders envisioned three separate but equal branches of government.  But for too long, we in Congress have skirted our duties by drafting weak legislation, that empowers rather than constrains the ever growing administrative state.  The Supreme Court’s Chevron decision only worsened this problem, as the Court abdicated its own role as the ultimate judge of the law.  Today’s bill curtails the overreach of executive agencies at the source of their power, the Administrative Procedure Act, and begins the important steps of returning control of the government to the people, through Congress.”
“Congress has largely outsourced its Article I, Section I legislative powers to the Executive, empowering bureaucrats while relegating itself to the legislative sidelines,” said Congressman Hensarling. “Exacerbating this congressional self-enfeeblement is a legal doctrine established by the Supreme Court known as Chevron Deference.  This is the foundation of the so-called Fourth Branch of government, in which federal agencies have become legislator, prosecutor, judge, and jury.  It’s past time for Congress to take back its constitutional authority. That is why Senator Lee and I started the Article I Project (A1P). The ‘Separation of Powers Act’ is a small but vital first step towards fulfilling the mission of A1P.”
Background
For many years, the nation has witnessed a steady accumulation of power within administrative agencies. As a practical matter, agencies’ power to regulate and to adjudicate has supplanted the legislation and judicial review as the primary means by which governance takes place at the federal level. This trend has only accelerated under President Obama; his major legislative accomplishments such as Obamacare and Dodd-Frank have delegated massive amounts of power to the federal bureaucracy, and the administration has sought aggressively push the bounds of its regulatory authorities.
The central precept undergirding the Constitution is the notion that the preservation of liberty depends of the separation of powers among branches capable of checking the excesses of each other. As James Madison put it in Federalist 47, “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” By definition, the accumulation of power within administrative agencies represents a shift away from the constitutional separation of powers and the liberty it protects. Insulated from the checks and balances on its authority, the federal bureaucracy has now imposed an estimated $1.88 trillion burden on the economy annually, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. That equals roughly $15,000 per household and 11.5% of the nation’s 2012 GDP. It is more than $300 billion higher than combined individual and corporate federal income tax receipts and equivalent to 85% of U.S. corporate profits in 2013. Judicial review represents the most effective remaining independent check on regulation and administrative action.
One of the primary means by which the judiciary checks the otherwise-unbridled powers of federal bureaucracy is by evaluating whether an agency’s action violates the law. In such cases, the paramount matter in contention is the meaning of the law at issue. For many years, the courts’ held that when considering the meaning of legal text, “[i]t is for the courts, not the [agencies], ultimately to determine as a matter of law what they include.” Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Gratz, 253 U.S. 421, 427 (1920). This approach was anchored in Chief Justice John Marshall’s seminal words in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803), that “i[t] is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.”
However, in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), the Supreme Court held that courts should defer to an agency’s interpretation of a statute as long as the statute is “ambiguous” and the agency’s reading is “reasonable.” In practice, these terms are interpreted extraordinarily leniently for agencies. In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court has extended similar deference to other legal interpretations by agencies. For example, in Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 453 (1997), the Court applied the Chevron standard to agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations. Furthermore, in Nat’l Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005), the Supreme Court held that statutory interpretations by an administrative agency can override previous interpretations by federal courts, and in City of Arlington, Tex. v. Fed. Commc'ns Comm., 133 S. Ct. 1863 (2013), the Supreme Court even went so far as to hold that a court must defer to an agency's interpretation that concerns the scope of the agency's jurisdiction.
The Separation of Powers Restoration Act would clarify in Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act that courts shall decide “de novo all relevant questions of law, including the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions and rules.”

Title: Lee Reaffirms Commitment To Let People Pick Next Court Nominee
Date: March 16, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Before President Obama announced his pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia Wednesday morning, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) reaffirmed his commitment to let the American people have a voice in that pick.
“The president has full and complete power to
nominate
individuals to the Supreme Court, as he will reportedly do later today,” Sen. Lee said. “But the Constitution also gives the Senate the full and complete power to reject or confirm the nominee,” Lee continued. “It’s as simple as that.”
“In light of the contentious presidential election already well underway, my colleagues and I on the Judiciary Committee have already given our advice and consent on this issue: we will not have any hearings or votes on President Obama’s pick.”
“Any meeting with any nominee put forward by President Obama would only be a waste of the Senate’s time. The Court has very ably dealt with temporary absences in the past and will do so again now.”

Title: Sen. Lee on Federalizing Water Infrastructure Financing
Date: March 4, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Friday, concerning Senate legislation specifically designed to federalize our nation’s water infrastructure financing system.
“What is happening to the people of Flint, Michigan is a man-made disaster,” Lee said. “Congress has special mechanisms for emergency spending when it is needed, but to date Michigan’s governor has not asked us for any, nor have Michigan’s Senators proposed any. Contrary to media reports, there is no federal ‘aid package’ for Flint even being considered.”
“And for a good reason: federal aid is not needed at this time. The state of Michigan has an enormous budget surplus this year and a large rainy-day fund, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. Governor Snyder has requested $200 million of that from the state legislature for Flint this year. Relief and repair efforts are already in the works. The people and policymakers of Michigan right now have all the government resources they need to fix the problem. And those public resources are being augmented every day by the generosity of individuals, businesses, labor unions, and civic organizations of every stripe from across the country. The only thing Congress is contributing to the Flint recovery is political grandstanding.
“What’s really happening here is that Washington politicians are using the crisis in Flint as an excuse to funnel taxpayer money to their own home states, and trying to sneak it through the Senate without proper debate and amendment. I respectfully object.”
Water Infrastructure Fact Sheet
Michigan already has the money to address this problem now.
Michigan has at least $386 million in the State’s Rainy Day Fund.
Michigan accumulated a $575 million surplus in 2015.
Relief and repair efforts are already underway.
Michigan already has access to other fully funded programs.
The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund has allotted approximately $25 million to Michigan for FY2016.
The Clean Water State Resolving Fund has allotted $58 million for FY2016.
President Obama denied FEMA aid for Flint.
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder asked President Obama to declare Flint a major disaster in January 2016. President Obama denied that request as well as the $96 million that Snyder asked for.
To the extent the federal government is partly responsible for the Flint crisis, injured parties can access the Treasury Department’s Judgment Fund.
An EPA employee notified the agency months before the emergency became public that Flint probably had a lead contamination problem.
If the residents of Flint believe the EPA should have acted sooner, they can sue the EPA in court, and if they win the Treasury Department’s Judgment Fund can cover any damages without any new legislation, authorization, or appropriation needed.
The proposed new water infrastructure programs are not paid for.
The Senate’s new water infrastructure spending is supposedly paid for by redirecting $250 million from the existing Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program.
This redirection, however, does not occur until 2020. It is highly likely that if Congress waits until 2020 to redirect this money, there will be none left and the fund will be depleted.

Title: Obama Admin Continues to Circumvent Law for DACA Recipients
Date: March 3, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Mike Lee of Utah are seeking details on an Obama Administration practice that puts individuals in the country illegally on a pathway to citizenship.  The scheme allows those granted deferred deportation to take advantage of an administratively created benefit called “advance parole,” which would allow such undocumented immigrants to gain lawful permanent residence, commonly known as a green card.  The immigrant can then later apply for U.S. citizenship.
The Obama Administration is expanding the scope of the immigration parole statute, which was designed to allow non-visa holders temporary access into the country on a case-by-case basis only for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or in cases of “significant public benefit.”  Immigrants applying for deferred deportation are now being encouraged to concurrently apply for advance parole, a benefit created through administrative action to certify that the applicant qualifies for immigration parole when re-entering the country after travel abroad.  Once an undocumented immigrant has left the country and has been granted re-entry as a parolee, he or she becomes eligible to apply for a green card, opening the door to citizenship.  Some organizations, including universities, are creating international trips for the express purpose of securing parole status for deferred deportation recipients.  The advance parole scheme also allows undocumented immigrants to evade legal re-entry prohibitions for individuals who have overstayed their visas or are otherwise illegally in the country.
In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Grassley and Lee requested details on the practice as well as statistics on the number of undocumented immigrants who have been granted parole status via the advance parole scheme and how many of them subsequently obtained a green card as a result.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces The Only Congress Can Change The Draft Act
Date: February 25, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced the Only Congress Can Change The Draft Act, which would ensure that only Congress can change current law controlling whether or not women must sign up for the Selective Service System.
“When it comes to whether or not women should be forced to fight in combat, there are honest differences of opinion on the issue,” Lee said.
“Some say the right policy now is to end selective service altogether. Some want to add women, but only as a contingency. Some say women might be drafted, but precluded from combat positions. This is an unsettled debate. So it’s a decision that should be made by the American people’s elected representatives – not unelected bureaucrats or judges,” Lee continued.
Under current law, only men between the ages of 18 and 25 must register with the Selective Service System. But there is a real danger that either the Obama administration or federal courts could try and change current policy.
This bill, cosponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), would ensure that neither federal courts nor unelected bureaucrats could change current policy and force American women into combat.

Title: Sen. Lee Introduces The Restoring Internet Freedom Act
Date: February 25, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would repeal the Federal Communication Commission's net neutrality rules and prevent the agency from promulgating similar rules in the future.
“The economic burden of these regulations will fall squarely on the backs of the consumers the FCC purports to help,” Lee said.
“The threat of anticompetitive behavior should always be taken seriously. But it makes no sense for a five-person panel of presidential appointees to write a sweeping law aimed at solving a problem that might someday exist. There are more effective, more democratic, and less intrusive ways to address anticompetitive behavior, including existing antitrust and consumer-protection laws,” Lee continued.
The legislation is co-sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-TN), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), and Tom Tillis (R-NC).

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Call For Review of Proposed Charter, Time Warner, Bright House Merger
Date: February 18, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—On Wednesday, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Chairman of the FCC Tom Wheeler, requesting a close review of Charter Communications’ proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.
“We are on the threshold of a dramatic transformation of the way consumers obtain video content that should increase competition and benefit American consumers,” the letter states.
“American consumers will benefit if we cross this threshold to increased competition, and we believe that your agencies play a role in making sure that transformation occurs. As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, we have carefully examined consolidation in these industries to ensure that existing market leaders to not block or co-opt new options for receiving video content or exercise disproportionate control over the video content market.”
The Senators note concern that the merged companies and comcast would control 70 to 90 percent of the broadband internet connections to American homes, which could hinder the ability of online video distributors to offer a viable alternative to cable services.  Regional cable companies could also find it difficult to compete. Additionally, they cite that maintaining a robust marketplace of ideas, news, and entertainment relies in part on the viability of independent programmers, who could end up being discriminated against if the merged companies are able to pay less for content.”

Title: Bicameral Conservative Group To Launch Article One Project at Kirby Center
Date: January 28, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON – A new network of House and Senate conservatives today announced the upcoming launch of the Article I Project (A1P). The group will develop and advance a broad agenda to strengthen Congress by reclaiming constitutional powers now being exercised by the Executive branch.
The launch will take place on Wednesday, February 3rd, 2016, at 8 am EST at Hillsdale College’s Kirby Center in Washington, D.C.
“If conservatives want to reform federal policy, we first have to reform the way policy gets made. The Constitution gives Congress the power to make the laws, but for too long Congress has either shirked its legislative responsibilities or delegated them to the Executive branch. It’s time that Congress reclaim its rightful Article I lawmaking powers,”
Lee said.
“The Article I Project is not some misty-eyed longing for a simpler time or era that’s come and gone. It’s a new network of conservatives working together to recover Congress’s correct constitutional role, and I’m honored to be a part,”
Hensarling said
.
Sens. Lee and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Rep. Hensarling will give addresses at the start of the event and will be available for Q&A as well. Reps. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Dave Brat (R-VA), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Gary Palmer (R-AL), Mia Love (R-UT), John Ratcliffe (R-TX), and Mark Walker (R-NC) will also be on hand for panel discussions hosted by

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Announce Hearing on Antitrust Implications of Occupational Licensing Regulations
Date: January 26, 2016

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today announced that the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights will hold a hearing on February 2 entitled, “License to Compete: Occupational Licensing and the State Action Doctrine.”
The hearing will examine how state licensing boards controlled by active market participants can adversely affect competition by erecting barriers to entry and protecting incumbents, and the proper role of antitrust law in preventing consumer harm in this area after the Supreme Court’s decision in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC.
“The rapid growth of state licensing boards that are controlled by members of the profession they regulate has become a major threat to equal opportunity in this country,” Sen. Lee said. “We need to examine the causes and consequences of such a major obstacle to economic mobility. I also look forward to examining what role the federal government can play in addressing the anticompetitive behavior of these boards.”
“When a state gives a profession the power to regulate itself, that profession must use its power responsibly: to protect consumers and not harm competition,” Sen. Klobuchar said. “Many boards, particularly in specialized and highly technical fields, perform a critical role in ensuring that members of their profession perform at the highest standards. At the same time, the use of licensing boards could have the opposite effect if qualified people are prevented from entering professions.  I look forward to exploring these issues at the hearing next month.”

Title: Lee Calls For Democratic Process On Omnibus
Date: December 17, 2015

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday regarding the omnibus spending bill scheduled for a vote Friday:
“The omnibus spending bill soon to come before us is chock full of controversial policies that never would have passed had they been exposed to the light of day,” Lee said.
“Not only does this bill spend an additional half-billion dollars on an unreformed and failing Head Start program, not only does this bill airdrop an entire cybersecurity bill which lacks important protections for privacy and personal information, but according to the White House, “this bill allows for the full funding of the Green Climate Fund, negotiated at the recent Paris Climate talks,” Lee continued.
“None of these policy changes would have passed by themselves. These are highly controversial policies and merit an open and honest debate on the Senate floor. It is an insult to this body, the Constitution, and the American people, that the least trusted institution in America is planning to sneak these policies through without public scrutiny or amendment. We have doubled down on everything the American people can’t stand about Washington, and many are now congratulating each other for it.”
“Rather than accepting this monstrosity, we should instead pass a six-week continuing resolution which would allow for an open process where these issues can be properly debated”

Title: Lee Calls For HUD Zoning Rule To Be Defunded
Date: December 10, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Thursday, reminding Republican leaders that the upcoming government funding bill is the last opportunity conservatives have to stop the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s new “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Final Rule.”
“Every American should be free to choose where to live,” Lee said, “and too often federal regulations intended to promote affordable housing and diversity only end up creating the opposite: higher housing prices and fewer choices for everyone.”
“Americans are indeed suffering from high housing prices,” Lee continued. “But the answer is not a top-down National Zoning Board in Washington.”
HUD’s new Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Final Rule would leverage the federal government’s fraud-ridden Community Development Block Grant program to force local governments to enact new zoning restrictions on residential housing. Zoning restrictions are a proven cause of rising housing costs for all Americans.

WASHINGTON— Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, issued the following statements following their hearing on Anheuser–Busch Inbev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller.
"The American beer market is a more than $100 billion business, and delivers a product that, in both its national brand and regional craft brew forms, holds a special place in American culture and hospitality,” Lee said. “Today’s hearing helped answer some of the questions we had about the merger and mitigated many of our concerns about the transaction."
“Today’s hearing was an opportunity to discuss how merging the world’s two biggest beer producers would impact competition and consumers across the country,” Klobuchar said. “We examined how the proposed merger would affect the price of a pint as well as the craft brewers who are serving up world class beers across the country. Wholesalers make decisions everyday on what brands to put on their trucks. By working to ensure those decisions are driven by consumer demand and not producer power, we can help competition in the beer industry remain on tap.”
During the hearing, Klobuchar highlighted the thriving craft brewery industry in Minnesota and pressed the witnesses on how the proposed merger would affect it. There are currently more than 70 breweries in Minnesota, which is more than the entire country had in 1978.

Title: Lee Holds Hearing on Proposed Inbev, SABMiller Merger
Date: December 8, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON— Today, Mike Lee (R–UT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, is holding a hearing on Anheuser–Busch Inbev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller. The hearing is expected to examine how the proposed merger of the world’s two biggest beer producers would impact competition and consumers across the country.
Below is Senator Lee’s opening statement, as prepared for delivery:
The subject of today’s hearing is the proposed acquisition of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev, the second largest and largest beer producers in the world, respectively. AB InBev announced the acquisition, for approximately $105 billion, on November 11. Concurrent with that transaction, the parties announced a plan to divest SABMiller’s stake in MillerCoors to joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing Company. That stake represents the entirety of SABMiller’s U.S. presence.
As a result, the parties expect their merger to have little if any impact on the American beer market. If true, this will obviate the vast majority of the concerns that traditionally accompany a merger of this size. Other market participants, however, have voiced concerns about AB InBev’s influence on distribution channels and the market access of small craft brewers, alleging that AB InBev is seeking greater vertical integration and attempting to exclude craft brewers from the market.
As we examine these central questions today and look at the overall state of competition in the beer industry, we must focus that review on how the current competitive dynamics will be impacted by the deal at hand. This analysis must consider both components of the transaction: the acquisition, as well as the divestiture of SABMiller’s entire U.S. business. Moreover, we will do well to remember that antitrust analysis is extremely fact specific and not driven by mere speculation or suggestion.
While legitimate antitrust concerns may exist with respect to AB InBev’s relationship with distributors, this hearing is first and foremost about its acquisition of SABMiller. Under the Clayton Act, the relevant inquiry is whether the effects of the deal “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly,” not whether conditions might be attached to the merger’s approval to restructure the market to the liking of the government or private plaintiffs. When, as is the case here, the acquiring party intends to divest the entirety of the acquired company’s U.S. business, the transaction’s effects on competition in American markets are likely to be negligible.
The American beer market is a more than $100 billion business, and delivers a product that, in both its national brand and regional craft brew forms, holds a special place in American culture and hospitality. Today’s hearing will provide a much needed opportunity to assess competition in the industry as it relates to this historic deal. I look forward to hearing from our esteemed witnesses and the productive discussion their testimony will no doubt inspire.

Title: Lee Letter Asks McConnell Not To Include Federal Land Buying Program in Spending Bill
Date: December 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and James Lankford (R-OK) sent a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Friday, asking him not to include language permanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in any end of the year or must-pass legislation.
“Since its inception 50 years ago, the LWCF has drifted far from its original intent and is in desperate need of reform,” the letter reads. “Simply reauthorizing the LWCF, or doing so with insubstantial reforms, will only further erode support for the program.”
There is currently a $19 billion backlog of maintenance projects on existing federal lands, the letter notes, while the LWCF has a $20 billion surplus. But the LWCF  hasn’t spent a dime on maintenance in over a decade. The letter asks McConnell to allow for a debate about whether “a dedicated portion of LWCF funds should be focused toward land the federal government already owns.”
The letter also asks that land acquisition rules and state allocation of LWCF funds be addressed.

Title: Lee offers Tribute to Governor Olene Walker
Date: December 1, 2015

Content:
Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Governor Olene Walker, Utah’s 15th Governor, who passed away on Saturday November 28, 2015 at the age of 85. She was the first woman to serve as Utah’s Governor, worked as Lieutenant Governor for over 11 years and was a member of the Utah legislature for eight years. Olene Walker will be remembered and revered by Utahns - not because of the many "firsts" she pioneered in politics - but for her commitment to leave a legacy of public, and more importantly, private service based on principles that truly last.  Olene Walker’s life and career were centered in the principles of life-long learning, selfless service and making a difference through civil discourse and meaningful dialogue.
Governor Walker believed that the best way to open a mind was to open a book.  Immediately upon becoming governor she launched her “Read with a Child” program – focused on getting adults to read with a child for 20 minutes every day.  She knew that 20 minutes of daily reading would not only transform children across the state by getting them to read at or above grade-level, but would transport them to magical places, big ideas and brighter futures.  Because she became governor at the age of 73, and as a grandmother, I think she also recognized that 20 minutes of reading with a child would inspire the adults in the State of Utah as well.  Governor Walker was never far from a book, or a group of children to read to, often choosing her personal favorite from Dr. Seuss, “Oh the Places You’ll Go.”  Governor Walker went many places in her public service but sent thousands and thousands of Utah children on adventures never to be forgotten in the wonderful world of good books.  She was living proof that books expand the mind and that a mind expanded, especially the mind of a child, could never return to its original state.  I was inspired when reading her obituary that the last line, in typical Olene Walker style, stated, “In lieu of flowers, please read with a child.”  Her commitment to the principle of life-long learning is a legacy in and of itself.
Governor Walker also understood that it didn’t really matter where she served, but how she served.  Whether working along side her husband in the family snack business, in the legislature or Governor’s office, Olene Walker knew that her time on this earth would never be measured by the titles she held but by the impact and influence she had on others.  She understood and lived the adage, “We are to live our lives not by days, but by deeds, not by seasons, but by service.”  After leaving the Governor’s mansion she participated in literacy forums, served an LDS mission with husband in New York and at an age when most people slow down, Olene Walker took on a new and many would say, “daunting,” challenge of leading dozens of 3-11 year-old children for two hours every Sunday in her LDS congregation.  Governor Walker served with confidence, charisma and a charm that was elevating and enlightening.  National political players, rural farmers, business executives and children were inspired by her energetic approach and responded to her invitation to engage because they sensed that what they were about to experience was not about Governor Walker – it was about them.  In an age of ego maniacs and narcissists Olene Walker’s example of selfless service in high office is a model for all to follow.
Governor Walker also understood the principle that mean-spirited arguments produce little while meaningful dialogue creates much.  She was known for her disarming style and her ability to pull people into a conversation.  She believed and lived by a motto my offices is committed to – that the solution to any, and every problem, begins when someone says, “Let’s talk about it.”  Olene Walker challenged political candidates, elected officials of both parties and young people in particular to transcend the talk-radio style bombast and personal attacks in favor of civil, serious and substantive discussions.  The Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics and Public Service, at her beloved Weber State University, is a testament to her commitment to make a difference through more meaningful and deeper dialogue.
A picture taken of Olene Walker taken inside the Governor’s mansion contains an interesting image that illuminates much of what Olene Walker was really all about.  Resting on a desk in the background of the picture is a statue of a vibrant, energetic, pioneering Brigham Young – he is walking swiftly, leading with staff in hand, eyes set on a bright future as he began the audacious endeavor of being the first to establish a lasting society in the tops of the rocky mountains.  In the picture, the statue of Brigham Young almost appears to be trying to keep up with Governor Walker.  Only Olene Walker could get a trailblazing Brigham to pick up the pace.  Governor Walker likewise was a pioneer and trailblazer – moving swiftly, leading, with a clear vision of a better society – guided by her principles of life-long learning, selfless service and civil dialogue. Her life of many firsts will be celebrated and emulated for generations to come because it was founded on, and inspired by, such principles – principles which truly last.

Title: Lee Applauds Implementation of the USA Freedom Act
Date: November 30, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today, commending the end of the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of Americans’ personal data.
“Today both the safety and Constitutional rights of American citizens are more secure thanks to the USA Freedom Act,” Lee said. “Not only did the USA Freedom Act strengthen the Fourth Amendment rights of all Americans by ending the bulk collection of personal data, but it also better ensured national security by closing a loophole that prevented the government from tracking foreign terrorists once they entered the United States.”
Signed into law on June 2, 2015, the USA Freedom Act gave the NSA 180 days to end its domestic bulk data collection program. That 180-day window expired on November 29.

Title: Lee, Klobuchar React to Proposed Pfizer, Allergan Merger
Date: November 24, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) released the following statements today regarding the proposed merger of Pfizer and Allergan.
"The mounting consolidation taking place in the healthcare industry is of concern to every American, and the Antitrust Subcommittee has and will continue to exercise close scrutiny of these transactions,” Lee said. “The proposed acquisition of Allergan by Pfizer raises concerns about overlapping drug portfolios, especially in the cutting edge field of biologics and biosimilars. We expect the enforcement agencies to review these matters thoroughly, as will the Subcommittee.”
“Healthy competition in the pharmaceutical market is necessary to ensuring consumers have access to affordable and innovative prescription drugs,” Klobuchar said. “I have fought tirelessly to promote competition in the health sector and I believe a merger of this record size needs to be examined carefully. We must be certain that the combination of overlapping drug portfolios and the elimination of a competitor will neither increase drug prices for consumers nor reduce incentives to research and develop  life-saving drugs.”

Title: Lee Introduces Resolution Calling on President Obama to Submit Climate Deal to Senate as A Treaty
Date: November 19, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a resolution, S. Con. Res. 25, calling on President Obama to seek the Senate’s advice and consent on whatever climate agreement is produced in Paris, as required by Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. The resolution has 30 original cosponsors.
“The statements made by the Executive Branch to the Senate during Senate consideration of the Convention [i.e., the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] and set forth in Executive Report 102–55 remain valid and in force,” the resolution reads; “and, accordingly, any agreement adopted at COP–21 [i.e., the Paris climate conference] containing targets and timetables […] must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent pursuant to Article II, section 2 of the Constitution.”
A companion resolution will be introduced in the House by Representatives Mike Kelly (R-PA) and Bill Flores (R-TX).
At a recent speech at the Heritage Foundation, Senator Lee addressed the Obama administration’s claims that the Paris climate agreement should not be considered a treaty. The speech can be read here.
The Paris climate deal is also expected to obligate the United States to transfer billions of dollars to developing nations in future years, well past Obama’s term in the White House.

Title: Lee Fights Broken Education Reauthorization Process
Date: November 18, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a speech on the Senate floor regarding the fraudulent manner in which the conference process has unfolded with respect to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Reauthorization bill.
Mr./Madam President, this is how the conference process is supposed to work.
But it is not how the conference process has been conducted with respect to this bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization.
Sure, we’re still voting to appoint conferees.
And those conferees will still convene a conference.
And that conference will still produce a conference report.
So from the surface, it will still look like the conference process is happening the way it’s supposed to.
But beneath the surface we know that all of this has already been pre-arranged, pre-cooked, pre-determined... by a select few members of Congress, working behind closed doors, free from scrutiny.
And we know that this vote was scheduled on extremely short notice, so that it would be difficult – if not impossible – for the rest of us to influence the substance of the conference report through motions to instruct.
Now, why does this matter?
We know the American people care deeply about K-12 education policy. But why should they care about this obscure parliamentary procedure in the Senate?
They should care – and Mr./Madam President, we know that they do care – because the process influences the policy.
In this case, the process expedites the passage of policies that we know don’t work – policies to which the American people are strongly opposed.
The speech also highlighted a successful Utah model, which is reworking the early education system at a local level:
In my home state of Utah, for instance, United Way of Salt Lake has partnered with two private financial institutions, Goldman Sachs and J.B. Pritzker, to provide first rate early education programs to thousands of Utah children.
They call it a “pay-for-success” loan.
With no upfront cost or risk to the taxpayers, private capital is invested in the Utah High Quality Preschool Program, which is implemented and overseen by United Way.
If, as expected, the preschool program results in increased school readiness and improved academic performance, the state of Utah repays the private investors with the public funds it would have spent on remedial services that the children would have needed between kindergarten and the twelfth grade, had they not participated in the program.
Washington policymakers should not look at Utah’s pay-for-success initiatives – and other local success stories like them – as potential federal programs, but as a testament to the power of local control.

Title: Senator Lee Delivers Remarks on “National Pregnancy Center Week
Date: November 10, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee delivered remarks on the Senate floor regarding “National Pregnancy Center Week.” Senator Lee requested unanimous consent from the Senate to approve Senate Resolution 37, which would designate the second week in November as “National Pregnancy Center Week.” Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) objected to the request.
Full text of Senator Lee’s remarks as prepared for delivery is available below, and video can be viewed here.
Madam President, I rise today to support, and to request the Senate’s approval of, Senate Resolution 37 – a resolution that would designate this week in November “National Pregnancy Center Week,” in honor of the life-saving and life-affirming work of America’s community-supported pregnancy centers.
I am asking for my colleagues’ unanimous consent because there is absolutely nothing contentious about this resolution or the pregnancy-resource centers it commemorates.
There are approximately
twenty-five hundred
pregnancy-resource centers in America. And every single day, they serve an average of
sixty-five thousand
women and men faced with challenging pregnancy decisions, providing them a wide array of resources.
This includes, at many centers, health-care services – like pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and testing for STDs and STIs.
It includes emotional and educational support – like “options counseling” and parenting classes.
And it includes material and logistical assistance to help new moms and dads deal with all the little things that easily add up to big obstacles in the first weeks and months of parenthood.
America’s pregnancy-resource centers aren’t out to make a profit or push an agenda. They’re just there to help – and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate of individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human life.
Madam President, any way you look at it, America’s pregnancy-resource centers deserve to be recognized with a “National Pregnancy Center Week.”
But the real measure of their significance isn’t in the words of a floor speech or the outcome of a vote – it’s in the millions of lives they help save from abortion every year. The millions of teachers, soldiers, and nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses, whose lives and contributions to our communities we might never have known had it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy center, giving their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, and to help young women and men find the hope and courage to choose life.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Tuesday, following the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decision affirming a federal district court’s nationwide injunction against President Obama’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program.
“The Fifth Circuit has issued a strong and well-reasoned opinion upholding aninjunction that temporarily blocks President Obama’s lawless executive amnesty program,” Lee said. “Our immigration system does need reform. But the reform must be debated and passed by Congress, not unilaterally imposed on the American people by the executive branch."

Title: Lee Calls on Congress to Assert Constitutional Powers Ahead of Climate Talks
Date: November 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Wednesday at The Heritage Foundation, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) called on Congress to assert its constitutional powers ahead of the upcoming U.N. climate-change negotiations in Paris.
“First, the House and Senate should take up and pass a joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress that an agreement of the cost and legal character contemplated by the Obama administration in Paris should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent,” Lee said.
“The purpose of this resolution would not be to oppose the president’s plans on the merits,” Lee continued, “but simply to make explicit that which has been implicit in every other previous climate-change negotiation.”
Lee also identified the “power of the purse” as another constitutional power Congress should use to make sure President Obama does not commit the United States to a climate-change agreement in Paris without seeking the Senate’s advice and consent.
“Members of both chambers and from both parties have a constitutional duty to assert with one voice that Congress will not send a dime of taxpayer money to the implementation of any agreement to which the Senate has not provided its advice and consent,” Lee said.
“That goes for the billions of dollars that President Obama has pledged to send to the so-called ‘Green Climate Fund.’ And it goes for any other funds that the Paris agreement would expect the United States to give to developing countries for clean-energy adaptation,” Lee continued.
Negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are set to begin in Paris on November 30 and will run through December 11.

Title: Lee, Hartzler Introduce Resolution Recognizing "National Pregnancy Center Week"
Date: November 3, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) introduced similar resolutions in the Senate and House today that designate the week of November 8, as "National Pregnancy Center Week."
"For all that we do on Capitol Hill to affirm and protect life, it pales in comparison to the face-to-face work pregnancy-help organizations do across this country every day," Lee said. "This nation is truly blessed to have so many heroes that are helping mothers, and fathers, make the courageous and selfless choice to welcome a new life into this world regardless of their personal circumstances."
“Pregnancy Care Centers are a shining example of what we should be doing more as Americans—individuals and communities working together to protect and promote life,” Hartzler said.  “These centers and the teams of dedicated people working tirelessly to assist women in need and save unborn lives.  They deserve our admiration and support.  From medical help, guidance, housing and material assistance, parenting lessons, emotional support, and promotion of life over abortion, roughly 2,500 pregnancy care and resource centers in America provide support and care to millions of women each and every year.  It is an honor to dedicate a week to recognize their tireless efforts.”
In addition to designating the week of November 8 as "National Pregnancy Center Week," the resolution also notes that:
Nonprofit organizations have been cooperating since November 13, 1971 to save as many lives as possible from abortion;
There are approximately 2,500 pregnancy centers in the United States;
Pregnancy centers reach more than 2.3 million people each year;
Every day in the United States pregnancy centers assist an average of 6,500 people;
Approximately 1,000 medical pregnancy centers provide limited ultrasound services at little or no cost;
Close to 230,000 ultrasounds are performed at pregnancy centers each year;
Nearly every pregnancy center care and resource center provides clients with material support for pregnancy and infant care.

“This bill was a compromise between the Intelligence community and the Chamber of Commerce,” Lee said.  “Its goal is to maximize the information given to the government and to protect companies from liability for sharing consumer data with the government.”
“The bill allows companies to share information with the government even if they promise their customers in their user agreements that they would not, and the users can’t sue,” Lee continued. “Neither privacy advocates nor civil liberty experts were included in the deliberations.”
“Because this legislation does not strike the right balance between security and privacy, I had to vote against it.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar React to Walgreens-Rite Aid Merger

WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairman and Ranking Member respectively of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, issued the following statements in response to the announced merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid.
“Our Subcommittee has long been focused on competition in the health care sector,” Lee said. "In December 2011, we held a hearing to examine the competitive effects of the merger between Express Scripts and Medco, two of the largest PBMs. In 2014, we looked at competition in the contact lens market, and last month we held a hearing to discuss the mergers between four of the five largest national health insurers. Competition is essential in every part of our economy, and especially so in a market as complex and important as health care. With that in mind, we hope that the antitrust agencies will closely scrutinize the merger of Walgreens and Rite Aid, the second and third largest drug store chains."
“Competition in the health care industry is essential to keeping health care costs down for American consumers,” Klobuchar said. “I have fought tirelessly to promote competition in the health sector and I believe the proposed merger of two of the three largest drug store chains in the country raises serious issues. It is critical that the proposed Walgreens-Rite Aid merger is closely examined to ensure it does not increase drug prices for consumers or reduce choice for pharmacy services.”

Title: Lee, Sessions Send Letter to Colleagues Urging Opposition to Budget Deal
Date: October 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) sent a Dear Colleague letter to their fellow senators Wednesday urging them to oppose the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.
From the letter:
“Just four years ago we forced the president and Senate Democrats to agree to the Budget Control Act of 2011 in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. That legislation increased the amount of we can borrow in exchange for $2.1 trillion in spending cuts. We were able to win this concession from the other side despite having only 45 members in the Senate and a much smaller majority in the House. Today, we have a 54-seat majority in the Senate and the largest House majority since 1930, but somehow we have no choice but to roll back these spending cuts and to increase the debt ceiling without any offsets. We cannot expect things to be any different in the future unless we make a conscious decision to change the way we do business here in the Senate.”

Title: Lee’s Statement in Opposition to Latest Budget Deal
Date: October 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after reviewing the 144-page budget deal released by Speaker John Boehner.
“As bad as the process that produced this budget deal is,” Lee said, “the policy is arguably worse.”
“We’re constantly told that raising the debt limit doesn’t actually increase any spending,” Lee continued, “but according to the Congressional Budget Office that is exactly what this bill does. Worse, it raids $150 billion from the Social Security Trust Fund, again delays entitlement spending cuts, and sells off part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time of historically low oil prices. In 2011 conservatives were able to use the debt limit to cut spending. Why is the debt limit an occasion for increased spending now?”

Title: Lee Reacts to Failure of Utah’s Obamacare Co-op
Date: October 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R–UT) released the following statement regarding recent reports that more than 50,000 Utahns will lose their health insurance thanks to the closing of Utah’s Obamacare cooperative Arches Health Plan.
“The collapse of Arches Health Plan will have a devastating effect on tens of thousands of Utah families who deserve better than the limited options available on the Obamacare exchanges,” Sen. Lee said.
In 20 Utah counties, Arches' departure leaves consumers with just one insurer offering plans on the exchange for 2016. Arches is the 10th Obamacare cooperative to shut down this year and the Department of Health and Human Services admitted earlier this month that total Obamacare enrollment for 2016 would be essentially flat, providing health insurance for less than half of the 21 million people they claimed the law would cover.
“It is long past time for the President to admit that his signature domestic policy initiative has fallen far short of the promises he made when trying to pass it,” Lee continued. “Utah was a leader in health-care innovation before this disastrous law, and Utahns would be best served if Obamacare was fully repealed and replaced with a true health care reform plan that provides states the flexibility and resources necessary to meet the needs of their citizens and pursue cutting-edge policies without Washington strings attached.”

Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Advances Bill on Criminal Justice Reform
Date: October 23, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee today passed the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act in a vote of 15-5. The bill grants judges greater sentencing flexibility for certain low-level drug offenders and establishes recidivism reduction programs, while targeting violent criminals.
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is an original cosponsor of the legislation. Below are his remarks from today’s markup, as prepared for delivery, and a video of Lee correcting misconceptions about the bill can be
viewed here
.
“Since my time as a prosecutor, I have been concerned by the excesses of our federal criminal justice system.  In many cases where there is no evidence of actual violence, the long sentences required by federal mandatory minimums are unjust. That’s why, more than two years ago now, Senator Durbin and I first introduced the Smarter Sentencing Act. I believe we can make sentencing more fair and efficient without reducing public safety.  The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act achieves that goal by reducing the most severe penalties that often lead to disproportionate outcomes, by expanding the availability of safety valve relief, and by increasing opportunities and incentives for rehabilitative programming in federal prison.
“Our criminal justice system has to be flexible enough to apply in many different situations. Prosecutors and judges must have the ability to impose lengthy sentences on serious offenders who pose the greatest threat to public safety, just as they must have the ability to impose modest sentences on those who violate our laws but do not pose an ongoing threat to public safety. So this bill leaves untouched the maximum penalty levels that exist under current law, and for some offenders, it increases those punishments.  It also does not eliminate any mandatory minimum sentences but instead takes a targeted approach, reducing the harshest mandatory penalties and providing limited relief for low-level offenders with limited criminal history.
"It is not just to keep people in jail until they are 70 or 80 just because they sold drugs or had a gun. Unfortunately, this is precisely the situation we have created with many of our lengthy mandatory prison sentences, as you who have heard me tell about Weldon Angelos well know.  Sentences like these are just too high: they impose real costs, both human and financial; they are out of step with American tradition; and they have to be fixed.  It’s not sufficient anymore to say that sentences like these – sentences that don’t fit the crime – are the cost of doing business.  They aren’t – we can fix them, and this bill does.”
The bill narrows the scope of mandatory minimum prison sentences to focus on the most serious drug offenders and violent criminals, while broadening and establishing new outlets for individuals with minimal non-felony criminal histories that may trigger mandatory minimum sentences under current law.  The bill also reduces certain mandatory minimums, providing judges with greater discretion when determining appropriate sentences, and preserves cooperation incentives to aid law enforcement in tracking down kingpins.
In addition to reducing prison terms for certain offenders through sentencing reform, qualifying inmates can earn reduced sentences through recidivism reduction programs outlined in the CORRECTIONS Act introduced by Cornyn and Whitehouse. The bill also makes retroactive the Fair Sentencing Act and certain statutory reforms that address inequities in drug sentences.
The bill is the product of a thoughtful bipartisan deliberation. In addition to Senator Lee, original cosponsors include Senators Grassley (R-IA), Durbin (D-IL), Cornyn (R-TX), Whitehouse (D-RI), Schumer (D-NY), Graham (R-SC), Leahy (D-VT), Booker (D-NJ), and Scott (R-SC).  Other cosponsors include Senators Tillis (R-NC), Coons (D-DE), Moran (R-Kan.), Feinstein (D-Cal.), Flake (R-AZ.), Blumenthal (D-CT), Franken (D-MN), and Klobuchar (D-MN).

WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement Thursday in anticipation of Friday’s House vote on H.R. 3762:
“On Friday the House of Representatives is set to vote on a reconciliation bill that repeals only parts of Obamacare. This simply isn’t good enough. Each of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama’s desk. If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill. With millions of Americans now getting health premium increase notices in the mail, we owe our constituents nothing less.”

Title: Lee Battles Big Egg In Defense of Little Mayo
Date: October 20, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today calling for an investigation into the America Egg Board and their alleged anti-competitive campaign against Hampton Creek’s “Just Mayo” vegan mayonnaise.
“Recent news reports have brought to light a series of emails, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, that contain compelling evidence that [American Egg Board] leadership, including the Egg Board’s President and CEO, may have violated the federal laws and administrative regulations governing checkoff programs,” the letter reads.
The 600 pages of correspondence suggest that members of the AEB staff, USDA officials, and top executives from the egg industry engaged in a strategic, multifaceted campaign to use the power and resources of the federal government to undermine the economic prospects of Hampton Creek, based on their fear that the food start-up’s product, Just Mayo, represented a “crisis” and a “major threat” to the egg industry,” the letter continues.
In addition to calling for a thorough investigation into the AEB, Lee also presses Secretary Vilsack to justify the existence of the AEB. “If these Great Depression era institutions have outlived their purpose, and if evidence suggests they behave like state-sponsored cartels that intimidate and handicap their competition, should Congress continue to authorize them,” the letter asks.
While Sen. Lee has never had the pleasure of trying “Just Mayo,” he is a huge fan of mayonnaise and is committed to preventing Big Egg from threatening what should otherwise be a dynamic and competitive mayonnaise market.

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Announce Hearing On Proposed SABMiller Acquisition by Anheuser-Busch Inbev
Date: October 20, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC— Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, today announced the committee will hold a hearing on Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller for over $103 billion. The hearing will examine how the proposed merger of the world’s two biggest beer producers would impact competition and consumers across the country.
"This hearing will provide an opportunity to publicly examine the impact of the so-called 'beerhemoth' merger on consumers and for the Antitrust Subcommittee to continue its oversight of potentially anticompetitive market consolidation,” Lee said. “Should the deal be finalized, I look forward to a productive and informative discussion."
“The proposal to merge the world’s two biggest beer producers raises serious antitrust concerns for the $100 billion a year beer industry,” Klobuchar said. “It is critical that we examine this deal closely to see how it will affect the price of a pint, and if it will harm the craft brewers that are serving up world class beers and jobs across the country. We must ensure competition in the beer industry remains on tap.”

Date: October 14, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, issued the following statements today regarding Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s proposal to purchase SABMiller for over $103 billion.
“The proposed acquisition of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced today, if consummated, would rank among the five largest mergers in history and consolidate approximately 70 percent of the U.S. beer market,” Lee said. "A deal of this size and scope demands close scrutiny of its impact on competition. In addition to the thorough review I expect this deal to receive from the agencies, should the parties reach a final agreement, the Antitrust Subcommittee will also be looking closely into how the merger may affect consumers and the marketplace.”
“The U.S. beer market is a $100 billion a year industry and Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s proposed acquisition of SABMiller raises important antitrust concerns,” Klobuchar said. “The merger could have negative consequences for consumers, including increased cost, and could deprive our thriving craft and independent brewers of distribution channels critical for reaching retail customers. The Antitrust Subcommittee must provide oversight and examine this deal closely.”

Title: Senator Lee Responds to Suspension of Syrian Rebels Training Program
Date: October 9, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement concerning the Pentagon's decision to end its Syrian rebel-training program:
“Many of my colleagues and I warned at the time of this program’s inception that implementation would be very risky and the goals were impractical given the fluid nature of the Syrian conflict.  Unfortunately, Senate leaders shoved authorization of this program into a must-pass continuing resolution last year instead of allowing it to be fully debated.  Now we are seeing the consequences of such rash actions. This program should be ended entirely, and the president must work with Congress in a transparent fashion to refocus our efforts on the issues that really matter to our national security.”
Last week, Senators Lee, Manchin (D-WV), Murphy (D-CT), and Udall (D-NM) sent a letter to U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Ash Carter, U.S. Department of State Secretary John Kerry, and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan urging them to end the unsuccessful and dangerous program. Full text of the letter is available here.
Lee, a member of the Senate Armed Serviced Committee (SASC), has been critical of this program since its inception and has closely monitored its implementation and results over the past year. He spoke out on the Senate floor in 2014 against then-Majority Leader Harry Reid’s inclusion of the program’s funding in a must-pass Continuing Resolution, calling the Senate’s failure to fully and openly debate this measure "a gross dereliction of duty."

The Senators wrote in part: “The Syria Train and Equip Program goes beyond simply being an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. As many of us initially warned, it is now aiding the very forces we aim to defeat. On Friday, USCENTCOM confirmed that some of the fighters that we trained and equipped had turned over ammunition and trucks to al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, Al Nusra Front. In exchange for safe passage, the fighters, trained by the U.S., gave up approximately 25% of their U.S.-issued equipment.”

Title: Senators Introduce Landmark Bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015
Date: October 1, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of senators led by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Assistant Democratic Leader Dick Durbin today is introducing comprehensive legislation aimed at recalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting violent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower-level drug crimes. The package also seeks to curb recidivism by helping prisoners successfully re-enter society. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 is also sponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).
“This historic reform bill addresses legitimate over-incarceration concerns while targeting violent criminals and masterminds in the drug trade.  It’s the product of thoughtful bipartisan deliberation, and I thank my colleagues for their hard work to promote opportunities to reduce recidivism while protecting our communities from violent career criminals.  This bill is an important component in my ongoing effort as Judiciary Committee chairman to ensure access to justice for both the victims and the accused,” Grassley said.
“This compromise represents more than three years of work on criminal justice reform.  The United States incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country on earth. Mandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent. In reality they have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety. Given tight budgets and overcrowded prison cells, our country must reform these outdated and ineffective laws that have cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. This bipartisan group is committed to getting this done,” Durbin said.
“This legislation is modeled after successful Texas reforms that have rehabilitated prisoners, reduced crime rates, and saved taxpayer dollars. This bipartisan package will protect law enforcement’s ability to aggressively target violent criminals and serious offenders, while focusing on justice, rehabilitation, and public safety. I look forward to working with this bipartisan coalition to move this bill through Congress and to the President’s desk,” Cornyn said.
"This bill marks an important step toward making our criminal justice system fairer by reducing overcrowded prison populations and giving prisoners the help they need to avoid committing future crimes. It also reflects a growing bipartisan recognition that we cannot incarcerate our way to safer communities, and that the current system too often pushes individuals into a cycle of recidivism that is hard to break. I thank Chairman Grassley for leading the long, thorough and collaborative process, respecting a wide range of views, that ultimately produced this bill, and I'm proud to support it," Whitehouse said.
"Since my time as a federal prosecutor, I have been concerned that federal sentencing laws too often require punishments that just don't fit the crime. These laws require many nonviolent offenders to spend years in prison, often with few opportunities for meaningful reform. Today's legislation addresses both of these problems by reducing mandatory minimums and by expanding opportunities for programs that have been proven to reduce recidivism. I am grateful for the close collaboration with senators from both parties that has made this important bill a reality today," Lee said.
“Crafting criminal justice reform in this Congress is like a Rubik’s cube, but this group of Republicans and Democrats worked hard to come up with a fair and balanced package that will make a real difference. This bill would make much needed reforms to sentencing for non-violent offenders, resulting in a much fairer criminal justice system. I’m hopeful that we can continue moving the ball forward in a bipartisan way to make the reforms our system needs,” Schumer said.
“We maintain the tools law enforcement needs to continue making sure that the worst drug traffickers and violent criminals stay off of our streets.  We also provide flexibility in sentencing for those offenders that deserve it.  I'm proud to support this important legislation,” Graham said.
“The broad bipartisan nature of this bill marks a new chapter in criminal justice reform.  Although I wish this bill did more, it will impact thousands of lives and save millions of dollars.  And, critically, its changes are not just forward looking.  By applying many of these reforms retroactively, Congress is, for the first time, acknowledging that when we pass unfair laws, we have a moral responsibility to fix our mistakes.  Real people, like Weldon Angelos, are paying with decades of their lives. We must keep pushing and see that this bill is enacted,” Leahy said.
“For decades, our broken criminal justice system has held our nation back from realizing its full potential. Today, we take a step forward. Mass incarceration has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, drained our economy, compromised public safety, hurt our children, and disproportionately affected communities of color while devaluing the very idea of justice in America. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act is a promising, bipartisan step forward to help right this wrong,” Booker said.
The bill narrows the scope of mandatory minimum prison sentences to focus on the most serious drug offenders and violent criminals, while broadening and establishing new outlets for individuals with minimal non-felony criminal histories that may trigger mandatory minimum sentences under current law.  The bill also reduces certain mandatory minimums, providing judges with greater discretion when determining appropriate sentences, and preserves cooperation incentives to aid law enforcement in tracking down kingpins.
In addition to reducing prison terms for certain offenders through sentencing reform, qualifying inmates can earn reduced sentences through recidivism reduction programs outlined in the CORRECTIONS Act introduced by Cornyn and Whitehouse. The bill also makes retroactive the Fair Sentencing Act and certain statutory reforms that address inequities in drug sentences.

Title: Lee, Grassley, Hatch Introduce FTC Reform Bill
Date: September 30, 2015

Content:
Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act (SMARTER Act).  This legislation reforms and modernizes the application of our antitrust laws by harmonizing the rules governing how the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) review proposed mergers and acquisitions.
Based on recommendations made by the Antitrust Modernization Commission in a 2007 report, the bill would require the FTC and DOJ to satisfy the same standard to obtain a preliminary injunction to block a merger and would eliminate existing disparities between the procedures the two agencies use in merger litigation.
Lee, Grassley, and Hatch said they look forward to a hearing on the bill that will be held on October 7th by the Subcommittee on Antitrust.  The Subcommittee will hear testimony from Edith Ramirez, Chairwoman of the FTC, and an expert panel of witnesses to explore the merits of the SMARTER Act and whether any improvements to the bill are warranted.
Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) has introduced the same version of the bill in the House of Representatives (H.R. 2745).
“The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission share concurrent jurisdiction to review proposed mergers for compliance with our nation’s antitrust laws, and parties to a merger should not face different sets of rules when preparing to undergo a merger review process depending on the happenstance of whether the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC reviews their merger,” Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Mike Lee said. “Instead, the procedures and standards for review should be the same,” Sen. Lee said, “and whether a merger proceeds should depend on whether it is pro-competitive or anti-competitive, not on which agency reviews the transaction. My co-sponsors and I favor sensible, responsible reform measures that equalize the standards and procedures governing how the FTC and DOJ litigate merger cases.”
“Our antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and promote competition,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley added. “We ought to be consistent when determining whether proposed mergers meet these goals, regardless of the agency conducting the review. Our legislation creates a more uniform standard for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure greater fairness and simplicity when reviewing proposed mergers and their impacts on consumers.”
“This is an important issue for the business community and for all Americans,” Sen. Hatch said. “There is no good reason for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to apply different standards in enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Businesses seeking to merge deserve consistent treatment without regard to which agency decides to review the merger. I look forward to working with Senators Lee and Grassley to move this legislation forward to bring much-needed reforms to the merger review process.”

Title: Lee Introduces National Labor Relations Board Reform Bill
Date: September 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced legislation that would strip the National Labor Relations Board of its power to prosecute and adjudicate labor disputes. The “Protecting American Jobs Act” would transfer the power to hear labor disputes to federal courts. The NLRB would retain the power to conduct investigations, but would not be allowed to prosecute them.
“For far too long the NLRB has acted as judge, jury, and executioner, for labor disputes in this country,” Sen. Lee said. “The havoc they have wrought by upsetting decades of established labor law has cost countless jobs. This common sense legislation would finally restore fairness and accountability to our nation’s labor laws."
The NLRB consists of five members all of whom are appointed by the president. Normally these members are confirmed by the Senate but President Obama illegally appointed three members without Senate consent in 2012. The NLRB then went on to issue more than one hundred illegal decisions before the Supreme Court ordered them vacated in 2013.
The NLRB does have a full five-member board today, but only because Senate Democrats broke the Senate’s filibuster rule and confirmed three new members by a bare majority just weeks after Senate Democrats suffered historic losses at the polls.
Since that time the NLRB has gone on to issue a slew of partisan, controversial, and disruptive opinions, including the recent Browning-Ferris decision which upended more than 30-years of settled law in the area of joint-employer law governing how franchises, franchisees, and employers interact.

Title: Lee Delivers Tribute to Elder Scott on Senate Floor
Date: September 24, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a tribute to the late Elder Richard G. Scott on the Senate Floor. The speech was deilvered at approximately 11:20 a.m. MT on C-SPAN2.
The full text of the remarks can be found below:
Mr. President,
I rise today to pay tribute to Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who passed away September 22, 2015, at the age of 86.
Richard G. Scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer fused with the tender softness of a disciple’s soul. A graduate of George Washington University in mechanical engineering, who did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a brilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections and calculations.  Yet, he became known throughout the world for an enormous heart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and have empathy for people from every walk of life.
Elder Scott’s gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, given up hope, or wandered far - to come home - home to the faith, family and community that would bring them real peace and lasting joy.  Countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come home and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them.  Ever in search of the one who was lost – Elder Scott’s words and witness of Jesus Christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide many a wanderer home.
Elder Scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for those who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, redemption and renewal in the midst of life’s storms.  He was himself a man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later his wife Jeanene to untimely deaths.  He also seemed to intimately understand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming uncertainty as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy that can descend upon the soul during difficult days and trying times.  Yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who struggled because he knew with certainty to what source we should look for strength and security during such days and at such times.
His complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and every soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully and often with tender personal pleadings.  He urged the struggling, as well as the faithful, to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them down or kept them from living up to their full potential.  Members of the LDS Church around the world often felt as they watched him speak that he was not only speaking specifically to them but he was also looking straight into their souls.  In truth, he was really just speaking with such love, empathy and compassion that he empowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what their Savior saw.
Elder Scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned on the road of life, but for the potential each person had to do, be and become more. He once declared, “We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day.”  Elder Scott’s vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; he focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places and more noble thoughts.
The role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his life and teachings. Elder Scott often expressed his belief in the unparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked as husband and wife, could have on children and communities. He taught that in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of valuing our differences.  To illustrate, he once declared, “I may not know what it means to be a woman, but I do know what it means to be taught by one and to love one with all my heart and soul.”  His love for his wife, Jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into his sermons.   I take comfort in knowing that after nearly twenty years Elder Scott has gone to that heavenly home he so often pointed to and is once again united with his Jeanene.
One of Elder Scott’s colleagues described him as a “clever teacher.”  His formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety, but rather, followed a pattern described in a hymn by Lorin Wheelwright titled, “Help Me Teach With Inspiration,” which says:
Help me teach with inspiration; Grant this blessing, Lord, I pray.
Help me lift a soul's ambition To a higher, nobler way.
Help me reach a friend in darkness; Help me guide him thru the night.
Help me show thy path to glory By the Spirit's holy light.
Help me find thy lambs who wander; Help me bring them to thy keep.
Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd; Father, help me feed thy sheep.
Elder Richard G. Scott was indeed an inspired teacher, leader and lifter of people.  His amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him to help engineer a path for all of us to return home.

Title: Sen. Lee Commends DOJ for Rigorous Review of Expedia-Orbitz Merger, Promises Continued Oversight of Competition for Travel Services
Date: September 18, 2015

WASHINGTON—Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today issued the following statement regarding the Department of Justice’s approval of the Expedia-Orbitz merger:
“I thank the Department of Justice for conducting a rigorous and thorough review of the merger between Expedia and Orbitz, two of the most popular online travel booking websites. The Department concluded that the deal is unlikely to result in new charges to consumers or higher commissions from airlines and hotels. It also observed that the travel booking marketplace is “rapidly evolving” and experiencing new entry. For these reasons, it found that the merger will not lessen competition. I appreciate this thoughtful analysis and look forward to continuing to monitor competition in the travel industry to ensure that consumers are benefitting from vigorous competition.”

Title: Lee & Leahy Press Senate to Protect Email Privacy
Date: August 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON (Tuesday, August 4, 2015)  – As the Senate prepares to take up sweeping cybersecurity information sharing legislation this week, Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said lawmakers must also work to protect Americans’ emails and other private information stored in the cloud.
On Tuesday, Lee and Leahy filed the bipartisan Electronic Communications Privacy Amendments Act of 2015 as an amendment to the information sharing bill.  The Lee-Leahy ECPA bill updates a three-decade-old law to protect Americans’ email and other data held in the cloud.  It requires law enforcement agencies to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before accessing it.  It also replaces the obsolete “180-day rule,” which allows warrantless access to older emails.  The bill has a strong bipartisan list of cosponsors including more than 20 Senators and more than 290 members in the House.
“Most Americans would be shocked to learn that because of a decades old quirk in the law, their emails and other digital communications older than 180 days are not fully protected by the 4th Amendment,” Lee said. “Considering the ubiquity of digital information today, it is far past time we updated federal law on digital privacy."
“The Senate must have a full, meaningful debate about the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bill and its implications for Americans’ privacy.  Part of that debate should be a discussion about protecting Americans’ email privacy.  This amendment ensures that the private information Americans electronically store in the cloud gets the same protections as the private information they physically store at home,” Leahy said.
The ECPA Amendments Act of 2015 enjoys broad support from the technology industry, privacy advocates, constitutional scholars, and policy groups across the ideological spectrum.

Title: Lee Votes To End Federal Funding For Planned Parenthood
Date: August 3, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke from the Senate floor today about his vote for S. 1881, a bill to end taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. You can read his full speech below:
Mr. President,
I rise to speak on the legislation we considered earlier today, introduced by the gentlelady from Iowa, Senator Ernst, which would transfer federal funds now granted to Planned Parenthood to other women’s health care and counseling centers. It is a modest, common-sense response to the blood-chilling scandal besetting America’s leading abortion provider.
To date, only four of the promised twelve undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officers and facilities have been released. And to be sure, Mr. President, in coming months there will be more revelations about Planned Parenthood’s profiteering violence and fraud.
There will be congressional investigations, to cut through the obstructions and obfuscations already undertaken by Planned Parenthood’s lawyers, spokespeople, and friends in the media.
There will be criminal investigations into whether physicians altered procedures – in violation of the law and medical ethics – to maximize the prices they could charge for the remains of their victims. And inquiries into Planned Parenthood’s army of clerks, lawyers, and bookkeepers who turned barbarism into commerce.
There may well be civil litigation brought against Planned Parenthood by former patients who did not realize their harrowing personal ordeals were being exploited for profit by people they thought they could trust.
So it will be some time before all the facts come out about the full scope of Planned Parenthood’s moral and financial corruption.
But the revelations exposed just in the first four videos - all by themselves – are more than enough to disqualify Planned Parenthood from continued taxpayer support.
After all, nobody is entitled to taxpayer money. Recipients have to continually demonstrate their worthiness for public support. I think we can all agree that it’s not too much to ask that our women’s healthcare grants not finance a criminal conspiracy against American women and children.
So of course we should pass Senator Ernst’s bill. It doesn’t cut any funding. It just transfers Planned Parenthood’s grants to other women’s and community health centers. This is a no-brainer.
And yet, Mr. President, this bill isn’t going to pass. Planned Parenthood’s defenders today blocked us from even having a debate on it. I can’t say I blame them. But the fear of open dialogue on the other side of the aisle is itself part of the unfolding scandal.
Let’s be honest. That the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry includes grisly revenue streams, legal corner-cutting, and the bullying de-humanization of the human family’s most vulnerable members should not surprise anyone who gives the matter five minutes of concentrated thought.
For all the political spin, at the end of the day, Planned Parenthood makes its money doing things any child could tell you is indefensible. That’s why those things are almost never actually defended – including on this floor today.
Defenders of Planned Parenthood offer instead gauzy rhetoric about “care,” and “access,” and “choice,” which are totally irrelevant to Senator Ernst’s thoughtful, focused compromise proposal.  On the other hand, the shocking words at the heart of this scandal – abortion, organs, price, “crunch” – are carefully avoided.
That’s what you do when forced to defend the indefensible: you distract, you confuse, you talk about anything else besides the facts at hand.
For in this debate, Planned Parenthood’s defenders’ true adversary is not the Center for Medical Progress, or the pro-life movement, or the millions of even pro-choice Americans outraged by the scandal. Like all defenders of institutional violence, their real adversary is the Truth.
The pro-life movement today may love different sinners and hate different sins than previous social reform movements. But they fight for the same Truth: that not only are all men created equal, but that all human beings are, in fact, human beings.
Abortion-on-demand survives today – as other peculiar institutions once did – violating a universal moral principle by disguising a biological fact. Such is the nature of violence, Mr./Madam President.
As the Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it in his Nobel Lecture in 1974:
“[L]et us not forget that violence does not live alone and is not capable of living alone: it is necessarily interwoven with falsehood. Between them lies the most intimate, the deepest of natural bonds. Violence finds its only refuge in falsehood, falsehood its only support in violence. Any man who has once acclaimed violence as his METHOD must inexorably choose falsehood as his PRINCIPLE. At its birth violence acts openly and even with pride. But no sooner does it become strong, firmly established, than it senses the rarefaction of the air around it and it cannot continue to exist without descending into a fog of lies, clothing them in sweet talk. It does not always, not necessarily, openly throttle the throat, more often it demands from its subjects only an oath of allegiance to falsehood, only complicity in falsehood.”
Complicity in the falsehood, Mr. President, that some of us created in the image and likeness of a loving God aren’t. That some of us endowed with inalienable human rights weren’t. That because of the color of our skin, the arrangement of our genes, the content of our prayers, or the tiny size of a little girl’s hand, some of us become them.
All to absolve ourselves for doing to them – to the weak, the vulnerable, the voiceless - terrible things that we know are terrible. That is what violence demands.
Because, the inhumane but all-too-human logic goes, if we all do it, and we all agree only to speak of it in comforting words, then maybe we can tell ourselves it isn’t wrong.
“Clump of cells.” “Tissue specimens.” “Products of conception.”
But even as we grope through this “fog of lies,” we all know the truth. And we know that one day, that truth is going to burn through the euphemisms like the sun through the clouds. And when that day comes, we are going to have to choose: whether to stay complicit in the falsehood, to crouch down a while longer in our comforting fog… or stand up, and face the searing truth of what is being done to those little hands and hearts, our “fellow passengers to the grave” still “so fresh from God.”
Mr. President, the day will come when – in an act not of reckoning but of love – America finally sets these things right in full. That day is not yet here.
For now, even though Planned Parenthood apparently breaks some laws, its lucrative business remains protected by others. So even when we do pass the Ernst bill – and we will, one day soon - Planned Parenthood will nonetheless continue - at least for while – in its grisly work.
But not in our name. And not with our money.
Planned Parenthood has betrayed our trust, and the trust of the women who came to them for help. Within the community of women’s health and services - even among those who support its mission - Planned Parenthood now stands apart. Planned Parenthood has chosen a path we cannot follow, crossed a line we cannot ignore, and profited from an unspeakable business we cannot support.
We can – and under the Ernst bill, we will – support health care, especially for vulnerable women and children, who are always targets for exploitation. That is why we must pass the Ernst bill and why I urge my colleagues to support it – to protect America’s women and children from Planned Parenthood’s ongoing abuse, and protect American taxpayers from financing it.
We no longer have to be complicit in the lie of Planned Parenthood, or the violence that it protects. The Ernst bill finally accepts the facts, embraces the Truth, and would help move our nation a small step forward toward the culture of life America’s every mother and child deserve.

Title: IRS Commissioner Commits Not to Target Religious Institutions
Date: July 30, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Under direct questioning from Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), IRS Commissioner John Koskinen promised Wednesday that he would not issue new regulations stripping religious institutions of their non-profit status due to their belief that only men and women can be joined in marriage.
“Will you commit to me that as long as you remain on as the commissioner of the IRS, you will not, in the absence of a directive by Congress or by the courts, a subsequent directive, one not in place right now, that you will not take any action to remove the tax exempt status from religious colleges or universities based on their belie that the marriage is between a man and a woman,” Lee asked at a Judiciary Oversight Subcommittee hearing.
“I can make that commitment,” Koskinen said.
“While I greatly appreciate Commissioner Koskinen’s word that he will not target religious institutions for their religious beliefs,” Lee said after the hearing, “it worries me and it should worry every American that the IRS does not absolutely disavow the power to target religious institutions based on their religious beliefs, even if the current IRS commissioner has committed not to use that power for the time being.”
“That is why I have introduced the First Amendment Defense Act,” Lee continued, legislation that would prevent any federal government agency from taking adverse action against any religious institution for their marriage beliefs.”

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Stop HUD Zoning Rule
Date: July 30, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Thursday after introducing the “Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act,” a bill which denies all federal funding for implementing the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s new “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Final Rule.”
“Every American should be free to choose where to live, and every community should be free to zone its neighborhoods and compete for new residents according to its distinct values,” Lee said. “The diversity of America’s neighborhoods – from dense cities to wide-open rural communities to suburbs in between – is a treasure that we need to preserve. We don’t need a National Zoning Board. Washington should let Americans ‘govern local.’”
“A better debate would be about how Americans could better spend the money that is wasted every year by the dysfunctional Community Development Block Grant Program,” Lee added.
A study by the Reason Foundation
found examples showing how this program contributes to cronyism by channeling taxpayer dollars to politically connected groups while doing absolutely nothing to combat poverty or housing segregation.
The Local Zoning Decisions Act would restrict any federal funding from being used to implement, administer, or enforce HUD’s new housing rule. The bill also prohibits any funds from being used for HUD’s “Fair Housing” database which could be used to further the administration’s radical pursuit of using “disparate impact theory” to punish communities that are not as demographically diverse as the administration would like.
Senators David Vitter (R-LA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) have all co-sponsored the bill.

Title: McConnell, Lee Continue Effort to Repeal Obamacare Through Reconciliation
Date: July 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – United States Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statements Tuesday on the important tools in the Senate’s balanced budget that allow Congress to pass legislation repealing Obamacare and its broken promises.
Leader McConnell: "Earlier this year, Senate Republicans passed a balanced budget, and with it the necessary procedural tools - via the budget reconciliation process - to bring an end to the nightmare of Obamacare.  Americans have faced skyrocketing health care costs, rampant fraud and more government between them and their doctors. And Republicans are united in working to repeal the broken promises of Obamacare and allow our country to start over fresh with real health reform that Americans deserve.  We will continue our effort to use reconciliation - as the budget makes clear - to fulfill the promise we made to our constituents.”
Sen. Lee: "Americans deserve quality health care at affordable prices and Obamacare is giving them the exact opposite. A Senate vote to repeal Obamacare on a simple majority basis through reconciliation is the best way to pursue that goal. The Majority Leader and I are committed to using reconciliation to repeal Obamacare in the 114th Congress.”

Title: Lee Calls On Senate Republicans To Repeal Obamacare Through Budget Reconciliation
Date: July 27, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement Monday in advance of Senate consideration of a Republican Leader amendment to fully repeal Obamacare.
"Earlier this year, I joined with my Senate Republican colleagues to pass a Budget Resolution that included reconciliation instructions to repeal Obamacare with a simple majority vote in the Senate,” Lee said.
“Then last week, Republican Leaders offered an amendment to fully repeal Obamacare on a House-passed partial-repeal bill, thereby creating the same opportunity, to pass repeal legislation with only 51 votes. I immediately announced my intention to pursue that vote on the floor, consistent with Senate Rule XXII.
“But like many of my colleagues, I believe the reconciliation option is a far superior strategy because it has the potential to pass both houses of Congress and reach the president’s desk - which has been my goal all along.
“Therefore, if Senate Republican leaders publicly commit to using budget reconciliation this year to repeal Obamacare, I will join that effort and withdraw my plan for a vote tonight.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Announce Hearing On Healthcare Insurance Industry Consolidation
Date: July 24, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today issued the following statements regarding recent announcements of mergers in the healthcare insurance industry.
“In a changing regulatory environment, the healthcare insurance industry is rapidly consolidating," Lee said.  "If each of the recently announced transactions is completed, the number of major health insurers in the United States would shrink to three.  It is imperative that we closely examine changes in the healthcare market, and what has caused these changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed and continue to receive quality health care at a competitive price.”
“Competition is critical to ensuring that consumers have access to the health insurance plans that best suit their families' needs at the lowest prices,” Klobuchar said. “Anthem’s proposed acquisition of Cigna and Aetna’s acquisition of Humana, both individually or combined‎, raise important antitrust concerns. The Antitrust Subcommittee has a duty to understand whether this consolidation would increase health insurance costs and jeopardize the ability of Americans to access affordable, high-quality health coverage, as well as whether claims of consumer benefits, corporate efficiency, and lower costs are realistic. I thank Chairman Lee for his attention to these vital issues."
Senator Lee is chair and Senator Klobuchar is ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights. The Antitrust subcommittee will hold a hearing on the consolidation of the healthcare insurance market in September.

Title: Lee Welcomes Simple-Majority Threshold For Obamacare Repeal
Date: July 24, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) offered the following statement after an Obamacare repeal amendment was scheduled for a Sunday vote during consideration of the Senate highway bill.
“Republicans now have an opportunity to make good on our promise to repeal Obamacare,” Lee said. “The first Obamacare vote on Sunday will have a 60 vote threshold, and Democrats will likely block it,” Lee continued. “But thanks to the sequencing of the votes we just locked in, Republicans will have the opportunity resurrect that Obamacare amendment later on in the process, and put it back before the Senate in a manner that only requires a simple-majority vote.”
After cloture is reached on the Export-Import Bank amendment, senators will still be allowed to offer germane amendments to the highway bill, each of which would only require a simple-majority to pass. If the Chair rules that the Obamacare amendment is non-germane, Senate Rule 22 also allows any senator to appeal that ruling to the full Senate. At that point, a simple-majority of Senators would have the power to add the Obamacare repeal amendment to the highway bill.
“I look forward to voting to repeal Obamacare with all 54 of my Republican colleagues Sunday,” Lee added, “and working with all of the Senate to finally bring real reform to our health care system.”

Title: Lee Letter Asks For DOJ And HHS Investigation Of Planned Parenthood
Date: July 21, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee and ten other Republican Senators sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell Tuesday, requesting a full investigation of whether Planned Parenthood has violated federal law prohibiting the sale of human fetal tissue for profit.
“Last Tuesday a video was released that appears to show Deborah Nucatola, the Senior Director for Medical Services at Planned Parenthood, discussing the payments received by abortion clinics as compensation for the transfer of fetal tissue from the clinics to scientific researchers and the alteration of abortion procedures to obtain intact organs,” the letter begins.
“The disturbing facts revealed in this video raise the question whether the employees of a federally funded organization have violated federal law by engaging in the transfer of human fetal tissue for profit, and whether the modification of abortion techniques for the purpose of obtaining that tissue violates applicable research guidelines established by federal law,” the letter continues.
Specifically, Nucatola’s statements in the video suggest that sections 498A and 498B of the Public Health Service Act may have been violated.
Section 498A requires doctors to certify that they did not alter the method or timing of an abortion for the purpose of obtaining human fetal tissue when that tissue is used in research conducted or supported by the National Institute of Health.
Section 498B prohibits the sale of human fetal issue.
“The videos released by the Center for Medical Progress raise serious concerns and that is why I have asked the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a full investigation of Planned Parenthood to determine if violations of 498B and 498A, respectively, have occurred,” Lee said.
The ten other senators signing the letter include, Senator David Vitter (R-LA), Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR), Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Senator John Boozman (R-AR), Senator James Lankford (R-OK), Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL).

Title: Lee Votes Against Federal Control of Education
Date: July 16, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement Thursday regarding his vote against the Every Child Achieves Act.
“Not only did the Senate miss an opportunity to put states back in control of education policy,” Lee said, “but the Every Child Achieves Act also expands the Department of Education’s role in early education policies.”
“Some have argued that this bill creates new protections for states who want to resist Washington dictates on curriculum or testing. But current law already includes similar protections and the Obama administration has already blatantly ignored those.”
“The only way to truly free Utah schools from Washington control,” Lee continued, “is to either allow federal education dollars to follow each student, as Sen. Scott’s amendment would have done, or empower states to set their own education policies, no matter what the Secretary of Education says, as Sen. Daines’s amendment would have allowed.”
“Utah parents have been asking for a new direction on education, but unfortunately this bill only gives them more of the same.”

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Drive Down Costs of Federally Funded Infrastructure Construction Projects
Date: July 16, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a bill that reduces the inflated costs of federal construction projects on our nation’s transportation infrastructure. The “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” also reduces burdens on federal contractors who train and employ low-skilled workers, while saving the American people billions of dollars in taxpayer money.
“The Davis-Bacon Act is an 80-year-old wage subsidy law that requires all federally funded projects worth more than $2,000 to pay workers the so-called ‘prevailing wage,’” Sen. Lee said. “However, the ‘prevailing wage’ is determined not by market forces operating in reality, but by federal bureaucrats operating in Washington, DC. As a result, federal contractors are charged, on average, a 22 percent premium on their labor costs above what private companies pay for the same project, which often prevents low-skilled workers from getting a fair shot. Repealing the outdated, costly Davis-Bacon Act will give federal contractors the ability to hire more workers of all skill level, while lowering the overall costs of federal transportation construction projects.”
Senator Lee plans to offer the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act as an amendment to the highway legislation that the Senate will consider later this month. Joining Senator Lee in support of the “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” are nine original cosponsors: Sens. Rubio (FL), McCain (AZ), Perdue (GA), Cruz (TX), Johnson (WI), Cotton (AR), Cornyn (TX), Alexander (TN), and Scott (SC).

“I will be taking the next 60 days to review President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran and discuss it with my colleagues and our military leaders.  I am concerned that in the administration’s desperation to reach an agreement compromises were made on important standards such as inspections and verification procedures, and that the immediate sanctions relief provided by this deal will only increase Iran’s ability to finance its terrorist proxies to destabilize the Middle East and threaten the United States,” Lee said.

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Comment on Potential Airline Collusion
Date: July 2, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today issued the following statements regarding the Department of Justice’s announcement that it was investigating potential collusion among certain airlines. Senator Lee is chair and Senator Klobuchar is ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.
“I am gravely concerned by the possibility that the airlines may have colluded to reduce capacity in order to artificially raise ticket fares,” Lee said.   “Americans deserve a strong and competitive passenger airline industry that offers safe service and reasonable fares.  Reports of anticompetitive practices, especially in a time of rapid industry concentration, deserve a high level of scrutiny.  The airlines already benefit from unique protections, including protection from competition with foreign air carriers in the domestic marketplace and antitrust immunity for international airline alliances, and so they have an even weightier responsibility to scrupulously abide  by the law.”
"Pricing in the airline industry has been a long-standing concern of everyone from families looking for an affordable vacation to small business owners trying to identify the best frequent flier program,” said Klobuchar. "The Justice Department must ensure that airlines are not entering into agreements that raise prices. Ensuring healthy competition is the core concern of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and we will be reviewing these allegations to determine how best to protect American consumers."

Title: Lee Calls For First Amendment Defense Act After Supreme Court Rules On Same-Sex Marriage
Date: June 26, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires states license marriages between people of the same sex.
“Today five Justices took a vital question about the future of American society out of the public square, imposing the views of five unelected judges on a country that is still in the midst of making up its mind about marriage,” Lee said. “That is unfortunate, but it is not the end of the discussion, as Americans of good faith who believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman will continue to live as witnesses to that truth. “
“I am nonetheless heartened by the majority’s reassurance that the religious liberty rights of all Americans, including those who advocate a traditional view of marriage, must be protected. As Justice Kennedy states in the decision, ‘the First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons.’”
“Our focus now must be on defending these crucial rights of conscience. That is exactly why Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) and I have introduced the First Amendment Defense Act, which would prevent the federal government from discriminating against anyone who believes that marriage is a union between one man and one woman."

Title: Lee Questions Federal Debt Programs

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after the Joint Economic Committee’s hearing on “The Economic Exposure of Federal Credit Programs.”
“From housing, to student loans, to cruise ships, federal credit programs are now one of the fastest growing parts of the federal government with about $3 trillion in loan exposure outstanding,” Lee said.
“The American taxpayer is ultimately on the hook for every last dime of this debt and yet not only is there no comprehensive plan to manage this portfolio, but there isn’t event a uniform method for analyzing its size or cost,” Lee continued.
“I do have serious doubts about the wisdom of most of these programs, and we must do some basic accounting to determine just how much these programs have left the taxpayers exposed. Chairman Dan Coats (R-IN) deserves all of our thanks for calling this hearing and getting this debate started.”

Title: Lee, Labrador Introduce Bill Protecting Religious Liberty
Date: June 17, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-ID), today reintroduced legislation to clarify and strengthen religious liberty protections in federal law, by safeguarding those individuals and institutions who promote traditional marriage from government retaliation.
The First Amendment Defense Act  (S. 1598, H.R. 2802) would prevent any federal agency from denying a tax exemption, grant, contract, license, or certification to an individual, association, or business based on their belief that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. For example, the bill would prohibit the IRS from stripping a church of its tax exemption for refusing to officiate same-sex weddings.
“There’s a reason the right to religious liberty appears first in our nation’s Bill of Rights,” said Senator Lee. “The freedom to live and to act in accordance with the dictates of one’s conscience and religious convictions is integral to human flourishing, serving as the foundation upon which America has produced the most diverse, tolerant, and stable society the world has ever known. The vast majority of Americans today still hold a robust view of religious liberty, yet across the country the right of conscience is threatened by state and local governments that coerce, intimidate, and penalize individuals, associations, and businesses who believe that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. The First Amendment Defense Act is necessary to ensure that this kind of government excess never occurs at the federal level.”
“Religious freedom is at the heart of what it means to be an American,” Labrador said. “America set the standard for upholding freedom of belief and worship in a diverse society. No American should ever doubt these protections enshrined in the First Amendment. Our bill ensures that the federal government does not penalize Americans for following their religious beliefs or moral convictions on traditional marriage. Our bill shields against federal intrusion without taking anything away from anyone. In a shifting landscape, it’s time that Congress proactively defend this sacred right.”
There are currently 18 co-sponsors on the Senate bill and 57 co-sponsors on the House companion bill. Senate co-sponsors include Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE).

Title: Lee, DeSantis Introduce Transportation Empowerment Act
Date: June 11, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Transportation Empowerment Act (S. 1541), a bill which would give states and localities far more control over their infrastructure spending by phasing out the federal gas tax. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) plans to introduce a companion bill in the House soon. The bill was cosponsored by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Senator David Vitter (R-LA).
“The federal government’s Highway Trust Fund is broke and another year of band aid funding is not going to fix it,” Sen. Lee said. “The Interstate Highway System was completed decades ago, drivers are buying less gas, and the federal government has wasted far too much money on non-highway projects. It is just an outdated system that is long overdue for reform.”
"American communities face a variety of transportation needs and it makes little sense to have Washington, DC serve as a bureaucratic middleman for basic projects,” Rep. DeSantis said. “I am proud to join with Senator Lee and offer modern reforms to our nation’s transportation policy through the Transportation Empowerment Act. Giving states the flexibility to tackle their own infrastructure needs will lower costs while improving responsiveness to the problems unique to each community.”
“Our bill would update today’s broken infrastructure funding system by slowly cutting the federal gas tax, thus giving states the opportunity better identify which projects need funding and how to fund them,” Sen. Lee added. “By cutting out the bureaucratic middle man in Washington, states will be able to keep more of their infrastructure dollars at home where they belong and they will be able to avoid the costly and often duplicative federal regulations that can bring any infrastructure project to a screeching halt.”

Title: Senators Introduce Amendment To Protect Against Indefinite Detention
Date: June 9, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the Due Process Guarantee amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The amendment is designed to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely, without charge or trial.
The amendment aims to end ongoing legal ambiguities by affirming and strengthening the principles behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971.
“America should never waiver in vigilantly pursuing those who would commit, or plot to commit, acts of treason against our country.  But the federal government should not be allowed to indefinitely imprison any American on the mere accusation of treason without affording them the due process guaranteed by our Constitution,” Sen. Mike Lee said. “By forbidding the government from detaining Americans without trial absent explicit congressional approval, the Due Process Guarantee amendment strikes the right balance between protecting our security and the civil liberties of each citizen.”
“Detaining Americans captured within the United States indefinitely without trial or even charge is a clear violation of our Constitution and our values, and it must not be permitted,” said Sen. Feinstein. "We’ve seen over and over again that our criminal justice system is well-equipped to interrogate and convict terrorists, and I support that process. We need to stand strong against terrorism, and we need to do so within the bounds of U.S. law. This amendment has been approved by the Senate in the past but not enacted; I’m hopeful that this year it will be adopted by both chambers of Congress.”
“This bipartisan amendment strengthens our nation’s founding principles of justice and fairness under the law by protecting all American citizens and lawful residents from indefinite detention without charge or trial while also guaranteeing due process of law,” said Sen. Collins. “Despite successfully passing the Senate with sixty-seven votes in 2012, this amendment unfortunately failed to be adopted. I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will take action to swiftly pass this amendment into law.”
"The indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen without due process is fundamentally un-American. Our founding fathers believed so firmly in the right to trial by jury that they enshrined it in the body of the Constitution, and again in the Sixth Amendment,” Sen. Paul said. "We can and will vigorously investigate and prosecute all who seek to do us harm, and we can do so while respecting the constitutional liberties of American citizens.”
"The Constitution does not allow President Obama, or any President, to apprehend an American citizen, arrested on U.S. soil, and detain these citizens indefinitely without a trial,” said Sen. Cruz. “That’s why I have consistently supported measures to prohibit indefinite detention in the NDAA. The Due Process Guarantee amendment will prohibit the President’s ability to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens arrested on American soil without trial or due process. While we must vigorously protect national security by pursuing violent terrorists and preventing acts of terror, we must also ensure our most basic rights as American citizens are protected.”
In recent years, some have argued that the indefinite detention of Americans is permissible under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Due Process Guarantee amendment clarifies that the AUMF and other general authorizations cannot be construed as acts of Congress that permit indefinite detention and codifies the “clear statement rule” to clarify that indefinite detention can only occur if Congress expressly authorizes it.
The bill also expands the Non-Detention Act of 1971 to include legal permanent residents in addition to citizens.
In December 2012, the Senate passed this amendment to the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act with 67 votes, but it stalled in the House of Representatives. This legislation is almost identical to that language.

Title: Bipartisan Group of Senators Introduce 'Made in USA' Legislation
Date: June 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) Senator King (I-ME), Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) introduced the Reinforcing American-Made Products Act (S. 1518). The bill seeks to make it easier for American manufacturers to use the “Made in USA” label without weakening the “Made in USA” standard.
“The ‘Made in USA’ label carries a great deal of importance and influence and many companies strive to boast that their products meet the country's rigorous standard,” said Senator Mike Lee. “Without weakening the standard, my colleagues and I hope to make use of the label less complicated, thus supporting American manufacturing jobs, limiting frivolous lawsuits, and strengthening the U.S. economy.”
“The revitalization of American manufacturing begins with ensuring that U.S. manufacturers do not face excessive burdens at home,” said Senator Angus King. “And allowing a more complex and burdensome state standard on so-called Made in the USA labeling to supersede a strong federal standard complicates the work of manufacturers across the country who are, in fact, making it in America, and contributing to their local economies. This legislation would maintain a clear national standard which will keep consumers informed and encourage our domestic manufacturers to keep making products right here at home.”
“Many products bearing the ‘Made in the USA’ label are manufactured by American workers in Maine and across our country.  It is critical to do everything that we can to protect the intent of this standard, which allows for products to be labeled ‘Made in the USA’ even if a small piece, such as a screw or a shoe lace, is sourced from a foreign country,” said Senator Susan Collins. “This common sense legislation will ensure a uniform standard across the nation and avoid unnecessary and costly hardships for companies who choose to support American jobs rather than ship them overseas.”
The Made in USA Act would ensure that the federal government maintains authority in setting country-of-origin labeling standards and that states do not create a patchwork of different standards governing interstate and exported goods. One state has complicated our country standard, setting a rigid 100 percent threshold and exposing manufacturers to unnecessary litigation. The Reinforcing American-Made Products Act would fix that by creating one national standard.

“All three branches of our nation’s armed services have told us that a listing of the Greater Sage-Grouse would negatively impact their training, readiness, operations, and costs,”
Senator Lee said
. “Western states have a well-established and exemplarily record of implementing their own sage-grouse conversation plans and there is zero need for other federal agencies to get involved.
“In Nevada, where mining, ranching, energy production, and outdoor recreation all serve as a central component of our local economy, the Administration’s overly restrictive sage grouse management plans would be devastating,”
said Senator Heller
. “Allowing our state to implement its proactive plan aimed at reducing threats, like wildfire and invasive species, to key habitats, is a better path forward. No doubt, with a chance to prove success at the state level, I’m confident Nevada and the other ten western states can support sustainable sage-grouse populations while at the same time maintain our western way of life.”
“The listing of the Greater Sage-Grouse and the Obama administration’s land-use plans will have a detrimental impact on Montana’s economy, our land users and our military’s access to critical training ranges,"
said Senator  Daines
. "Western states know best how to balance the management of our natural resources and wildlife with our recreational and local economic needs. States should be empowered to implement their own plans, not forced to abide by another burdensome, out-of-touch federal policy."
"The Endangered Species Act has forced communities to comply with expensive red tape in order protect insects and animals deemed threatened or endangered, yet the success rate of species being delisted is a meager 2 percent,"
said Sen. Inhofe
, Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "The American Burying Beetle was listed in 1989, and its known population has skyrocketed but it remains on the lists, leaving those in its range to work around the habitat of this thriving beetle. Oklahoma will also successfully conserve the Lesser Prairie Chicken, and its recent listing was unnecessary and politically driven. The range for each of these species include Oklahoma military installations, and the last thing our military needs at a time of constrained budgets is to designate resources to comply with excessive regulations.”
“We should be good stewards of our land and animals, but the Endangered Species Act listing of the American burying beetle and lesser prairie chicken in Oklahoma simply go too far,”
said Senator Lankford
. “This type of extremism unnecessarily burdens some of our national defense installations, as well as agricultural and private economic activity. This amendment is needed to help the military maintain their resources and give Oklahoma more time to enact their conservation activities.”
“Potentially disrupting activities at military installations located in the Lesser Prairie Chicken habitat area is yet another example of the uncertainty and havoc caused by the decision to list the bird as a threatened species,”
Senator Moran said
. “I continue to make the case that more federal government regulations and increased intrusion into lives and businesses of stakeholders is not the answer for conserving the bird. It is time for common sense to prevail in Congress – we should take action to block the bird’s listing and give Kansas and other states impacted the opportunity to improve the habitat area at the local level.”
"In 2011, then-Secretary Salazar invited states to prepare conservation plans in order to recover and conserve the Greater Sage-Grouse. Since then, our state has devoted enormous resources to develop a sustainable, long-term plan to preserve the species,"
said Senator Hatch
. "Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior has since scrapped that idea and replaced it with a heavy-handed, top-down approach that is focused more on restricting economic development on millions of acres of public land and less on conserving the Grouse.  Utah deserves the opportunity to protect this bird in a balanced manner that takes into consideration the needs of the public as well as the species. This amendment empowers our state to do just that, and I strongly support its passage."
The amendment would delay listing the Greater Sage Grouse so states can implement conservation plans to ensure our military readiness and the survival of the bird. It would also delay listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken for a period of at least five years.

Date: May 28, 2015

WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today issued the following statements regarding the proposed Charter Communications-Time Warner Cable merger. Senator Lee is chair and Senator Klobuchar is ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.
“The proposed merger between Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable,  and the acquisition of Bright House Networks, could have major consequences for both consumers and competition,” Lee said.  “Vibrant competition in the cable industry ensures reasonable pricing and quality service for millions of cable subscribers, and so I look forward to the opportunity to evaluate the benefits and challenges presented by this potential consolidation of the cable market.”
“Consumers deserve fair prices and high-quality service from their TV, Internet, and phone service providers,” said Klobuchar. “We need to make sure the proposed merger between Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable does not harm consumers by adversely affecting competition or stifling innovation in the video and broadband markets. Telecommunications services are essential to our economy, and as the leaders of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee and I will be looking closely at the effects that this merger could have on consumers.”

Title: Lee Says Latest EPA Power Grap Threatens Utah's Economy
Date: May 28, 2015

WASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s new Waters of the United States rule.
"The EPA's latest power grab threatens every cog in Utah's economy,” Lee said. “Our farmers, ranchers, miners, oil and natural gas producers, will all face higher costs thanks to these new intrusive and unnecessary EPA regulations.”
“Perhaps most troubling,” Lee continued, “is the unprecedented lobbying campaign deployed by the EPA to sell its rule to a public that did not want it. This is not how federal agencies are supposed to operate and it is long passed time these bureaucrats were made accountable to the American people.”

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied President Obama’s request to begin implementing his executive amnesty program.
“The Fifth Circuit should be commended for its well-reasoned decision to prevent President Obama from implementing his lawless executive amnesty program,” Lee said. “Our immigration system is in desperate need of reform. But that reform must be agreed to and passed by Congress, not unilaterally imposed on the American people by the executive branch."

"It is unfortunate that some of my colleagues chose to continue to put our nation's national security at risk by failing to choose the only option available to keep our nation's most essential domestic counterterrorism programs up and running," Lee said.
"That said, I stand committed to staying here in Washington, all week if necessary, to keep working towards passage of the USA Freedom Act."

Title: Lee Votes To Block Wasteful Trade Adjustment Assistance Program
Date: May 21, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) issued the following statement Thursday regarding his vote not to invoke cloture on the Hatch Substitute Amendment #1221 to H.R. 1314, the legislative vehicle for the Trade Promotion Authority bill.
“I am a big believer in free trade,” Lee said. “But I have been very clear from the beginning of this debate that I could not vote for Trade Promotion Authority if the wasteful and ineffectual Trade Adjustment Assistance program was attached.”
“TAA was originally meant to help American manufacturing workers whose jobs were lost directly due to free trade agreements. However, Congress has allowed the program to expand into other sectors and loosened its eligibility requirements, resulting in a wasteful program spending billions of dollars that does not lead to increased employment or higher wages for displaced workers,” Lee continued.
“While I would love to vote for TPA, I cannot in good conscious make that vote if it also means needlessly expanding the size and scope of the federal government, which is exactly what this TAA program does. I hope to have the chance to give my full and unreserved support to the TPA, as a stand-alone bill, in the near future.”

“I am thrilled that the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Justice Jill Parrish today. She has distinguished herself though her time as an extraordinary
prosecutor
at the U.S. Attorney’s office, through her work
as a litigator
in private practice, and her service
as a justice
on Utah’s Supreme Court. Justice Parrish is a friend to all who know her, and a credit to the legal profession and to jurists everywhere. I can’t think of anyone better suited to fill the
very large
shoes of Judge Dee Benson than Justice Parrish, and thank her for her willingness to serve in this capacity. Today is a good day for Utah, and a good day for the Federal Judiciary.”

Title: Lee Joins Rand Paul On Senate Floor To Support Full Debate On USA Freedom Act
Date: May 20, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) on the floor of the Senate Wednesday to call for a full debate and amendment process for House-passed USA Freedom Act.
“While the senator from Kentucky and I come to different conclusions with regard to specific question as to whether we should allow section 215 of the Patriot Act to expire,” Lee said. “I absolutely stand with the junior senator from Kentucky and more importantly I stand with the American people with regard to the need for a transparent and open amendment process and for an open and honest debate in front of the American people. ”
The USA Freedom Act, which passed the House by a landslide 338-88 vote earlier this month, would end the bulk collection of Americans’ private data under Section 215 of the Patriot Act while still providing our intelligence agencies the tools they need to track suspected terrorists in the United States.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has said he will give the USA Freedom Act a vote, but he has not promised a fair debate on the bill that includes an open amendment process. Senator Paul will be speaking on the floor through Thursday morning calling on Senate leadership to allow votes on his amendments with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) to the USA Freedom Act. Senator Lee fully supports these amendments getting votes.
“I agree with the junior senator from Kentucky that the American people deserve better than they are getting," said Lee. "And quite frankly it is time that they expect more from the United States Senate. This is not time for more cliffs, for more secrecy, and more 11th hour backroom deals. It’s time for the kind of bipartisan bicameral consensus that I believe is embodied in the USA Freedom Act.”

Title: Lee Calls For USA Freedom Act Debate Before Key Program Expires
Date: May 19, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON  - Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) asked for unanimous consent Tuesday, to begin debate on the House-passed USA Freedom Act so that the Senate could act to preserve a vital intelligence committee program before it expires Sunday, May 31st.
“Free trade is of absolute importance in this country,” Lee said. “It is not, however, as pressing as another matter that we should be considering now. Certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act will expire a week from Sunday at midnight. This is an important issue and it is one that deserves debate and full consideration in the United States Senate."
If agreed to, Lee’s request would have allowed debate to begin on the House-passed USA Freedom Act with altering amendments from both parties. But the motion was blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) who promised to work through the weekend if necessary on a solution to the issue.
“We have had months and months to plan for this deadline, years in fact,” Lee continued. “And during these past several months we have worked with House members, members of the law enforcement community, members of the intelligence community, to create a compromise bill that now enjoys the support of the Attorney General of the United States, of the Director of National Intelligence, the telecom industry, the NRA, the tech community, privacy groups, and 338 members of the House of Representatives. This is a super majority. A super-duper majority. We’ve had a week since the House passed this bill and it is time that we took it up in earnest and gave it the full attention and consideration of the Senate. Then we can return to TPA and finish it without facing expiration of a key national security tool without anything to put in its place.”

Title: Lee Amendment Preserves National Guard Apache Fleet
Date: May 18, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - This week in the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) successfully added an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that preserves the National Guard’s Apache helicopter fleet.
Lee’s amendment to the Army’s Aviation Restructuring Initiative extends the prohibition on AH-64 Apache helicopter transfers out of the National Guard for FY
2016.
"The hard-working men and women of the National Guard’s 1-211th Attack Helicopter Battalion have served with honor and distinction in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Lee. “The extension provided by my amendment will give Congress and the Department of Defense more time to ensure the National Guard’s resources are used in the most effective and beneficial way to protect our national security."
Senator Lee continues to view sequestration for the Defense Department as a misguided and ultimately unsustainable mechanism. He also believes that Congress needs to find a better way to protect the freedom of Americans through reductions in overall federal spending, smart reforms to the Defense Department, and better aligning our international engagements with U.S economic and security priorities.

Title: Lee Commends House Passage of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015
Date: May 14, 2015

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement after a sweeping, bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives voted to approve the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, a bill that would end the government’s dragnet collection of Americans’ data under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. Lee recently introduced the legislation in the Senate with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).
“With the House’s passage of the USA FREEDOM Act today, the American people are one step closer to having their core civil liberties protected from unconstitutional government surveillance under the USA PATRIOT Act. The overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the House affirms last week’s unanimous decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that that the National Security Agency’s (NSA)  bulk phone records collection program goes beyond what is authorized under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Now, the Senate must act."

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) led a colloquy regarding the USA Freedom Act on the Senate floor.  Bill co-author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and co-sponsors Senator Dean Heller (R-NV), Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), and Senator Richard Bloomenthal participated and shared their support.
"It’s not a question of if things like this will be abused; it’s a question of when they will ultimately be abused," said Senator Lee. "It’s our job as U.S. Senators to help protect the American people against excessive risk to this type of abuse."
U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of Intelligence James Clapper also sent a joint letter to Lee and Leahy declaring their strong support for the legislation.
Overall, the significant reforms contained in this legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how our intelligence activities are carried out and in the oversight of those activities, while ensuring vital national security authorities remain in place. You have our commitment that we will notify Congress if we find that provisions of this law significantly impair the Intelligence Community’s ability to protect national security. We urge the Congress to pass this bill promptly.

Letter to Senators Leahy and Lee Supporting USA Freedom Act
Earlier in the day, the White House issued a Statement of Administrative Policy calling on the House to pass the USA Freedom Act and for the Senate to act on the bill shortly.
The USA FREEDOM Act’s significant reform would provide the public greater trust and confidence in our national security programs and the      checks and balances that form an integral part of their operation. Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that this legislation would reform could expire on June 1. The Administration supports swift House passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, and urges the Senate to follow suit.

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Lee issued the following statement after a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the National Security Agency’s (NSA) bulk collection of Americans’ phone records goes beyond what is authorized under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.

The House is poised to pass the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 next week, and the Senate should do the same. We urge the Majority Leader to bring the USA FREEDOM Act up for a vote next week after the House passes it.”

Title: Lee hires new Energy and Natural Resources Legislative Assistant
Date: May 6, 2015

Content:
Today, Senator Lee announced that he has hired Chris Prandoni to serve as his new Energy and Natural Resources Legislative Assistant. Prior to joining Senator Lee’s staff, starting on Wednesday, May 6, Prandoni was the Director of Energy and Environment Policy at Americans for Tax Reform, where he managed their energy portfolio covering oil and natural gas policy, as well as mining, electricity generation, and utility interests.
“I’m thrilled to have Chris join my staff,” Sen. Lee said. “His extensive policy experience with carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, and oil and natural gas development on federal lands will make him an invaluable asset to the people of Utah, as he will advise me in my capacity as a member of the Senate’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Having worked closely with state legislators and utility companies around the country, helping them comply with federal regulations, Chris knows how important local natural resource management is to a land-rich state like Utah. I look forward to working with him as I continue fighting in the Senate for legislative solutions that empower Utahns to manage and control their natural resources according to the needs and priorities of their communities.”

Title: ICYMI: Mike Lee's Idea Factory
Date: May 4, 2015

Content:
The National Journal published a profile piece on Senator Mike Lee's work in Washington. The article provides good analysis of his efforts to expand his influence in the Senate by creating an innovative policy agenda. Here are some highlights from
the article
:
"Today, the Utah senator is one of the Beltway's most aggressive purveyors of reform-minded conservative ideas. While his three closest allies in the Senate—Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul, all fellow first-termers who, like Lee, rode the tea-party wave into office—have spent the past few years raising their profiles in preparation for presidential runs, Lee has chosen a different path: hunkering down with policy experts in an effort to shape an agenda that will help Republicans appeal to the poor and middle class.”
"Blending populist communitarianism with a libertarian suspicion of government puts Lee in the sweet spot for reform conservatives—that is, Republicans who want to put forward affirmative policy ideas instead of just fighting big government. "He's been one of the real policy entrepreneurs since he came in," says Yuval Levin, founding editor of National Affairs and a leader of the reform-conservative movement. "He's one of a handful of members really interested in policy details and in turning conservative ideas into policy proposals." More than anyone else, says conservative columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, Lee has filled "the policy vacuum" in the Senate. "Conservatism for a lot of the Obama years moved away from being a policy-oriented movement," Ponnuru says. "Senator Lee is playing an important role beefing up the policy content.””
"Ultimately, say observers, Lee's influence isn't about any specific bill he puts forth—or even about getting his friends to talk up reform on the presidential trail. Rather, his aggressive policy talk has helped re-energize debate among his Senate colleagues in general. By putting ideas out there without getting beaten up, says Salam, Lee is encouraging his fellow lawmakers to take more risks and think more creatively about policy. Ironically, Lee's credibility with the right, cemented by less-constructive antics like the shutdown, is arguably what has made it possible for him to champion some of these ideas. "You cannot accuse him of being a RINO squish," says Ponnuru (i.e., "Republican in name only”)."

Title: Senators Lee, Hatch, Vitter Introduce Native Species Protection Act
Date: April 30, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Senator David Vitter (R-LA) introduced the Native Species Protection Act (S 1142). The bill seeks to clarify that noncommercial species found entirely within the borders of a single State are not in interstate commerce or subject to regulation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 or any other provision of law enacted as an exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
“There are real environmental benefits to protecting endangered species from extinction, but the federal law intended to establish such protections – the Endangered Species Act – is in serious need of reform,” said Senator Lee. “In the nearly fifty years since it was signed into law, the ESA has done more to impede economic activity, obstruct local conservation efforts, and give federal bureaucrats regulatory control over private property, than it has done to protect endangered species. And far too often, the federal government oversteps its constitutionally limited powers by using the ESA to regulate single-state species – such as the Utah prairie dog, a species that knows no home other than Utah. The Native Species Protection Act would change that, by clarifying that the federal government has no legitimate regulatory jurisdiction over species found exclusively within the borders of a single state. This is a commonsense reform that would limit the damage caused by federal mismanagement of protected species and their habitats, while empowering state and local officials to pursue sensible conservation plans with their communities.”
"States are best equipped to manage wildlife populations within their borders in a responsible manner,” said Senator Hatch. “The Native Species Protection Act will allow state wildlife management authorities, in cooperation with local communities, to develop balanced conservation plans that meet the unique needs of state-specific species and affected areas. I’m pleased to be a part of this effort and hope that the Senate will act on it quickly."
“There needs to be a delicate balance between protecting endangered species, private property rights, and local economies, and this bill will ensure that federal bureaucrats don’t take advantage of landowners,” said Senator Vitter. “Common sense dictates that if someone plans to build a garden on his own land, he should not be subjected to unnecessary government intrusion and expensive penalties. It’s important that we protect endangered species, but that does not mean that far left environmental activists should use the law to endanger private property rights.”

Title: Senators Aim to End Patent Abuses that Cost U.S. Economy Billions of Dollars Every Year
Date: April 29, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Patrick Leahy, along with senior committee members John Cornyn and Chuck Schumer today introduced legislation that would make necessary and commonsense reforms to restore integrity to the U.S. patent system.  Judiciary Committee members Mike Lee, Orrin Hatch and Amy Klobuchar are also original cosponsors of the bill.
The bipartisan bill takes concrete steps to stop abusive patent litigation practices and prevent bad actors from further undermining the system that has made the United States one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in the world.
“Abusive patent litigation is a threat to our economy and costs consumers and businesses billions of dollars each year.  Too often, small business owners are being targeted for doing nothing more than using off-the-shelf products.  These types of frivolous lawsuits cost them millions of dollars and force them to settle despite having a strong defense,” Grassley said.  “The meaningful reforms in our bipartisan bill are needed to ensure that theinnovation and entrepreneurship our patent system was designed to protect isn’t undermined.”
“When small businesses in Vermont and across the country are threatened with patent infringement lawsuits for offering Wi-Fi to their customers or using document scanners in their offices, we can all agree the system is not being used as intended,” Leahy said.  “I have been working with Senators from both parties and a range of stakeholders for two years to design legislation that protects main street businesses and innovators. I am proud to be introducing the PATENT Act today with Chairman Grassley, Senators Cornyn and Schumer to protect those who are targeted by patent trolls while preserving what has made America’s patent system great.”
“The time has come to reform our patent system so innovators are free to develop important advances in technology without the threat of lawsuits from patent abusers only interested in making a dollar, not a difference,” said Cornyn. “I’m proud to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle to address this issue and help unleash the creative firepower of American entrepreneurs.”
“Patent trolls are taking a system meant to drive innovation and instead using it to stifle job-creating businesses around the country. Main Street stores, tech startups and more are being smothered by the abuse that is all too common in our patent system, and it’s time for that to end. This bipartisan bill shifts the legal burden back onto those who would abuse the patent system in order to make a quick buck at the expense of businesses that are playing by the rules. I’m hopeful we can move quickly and in a bipartisan way to get this bill passed in committee and on the Senate floor this summer,” Schumer said.
“Abusive tactics by patent trolls, both in and out of the courtroom, are harming innovation and our economy.  Our balanced approach to reform will deliver needed help to small businesses beleaguered by abusive demand letters and extortionate litigation, and will ensure a commonsense and efficient approach to litigating complex cases, without endangering the patent system” Lee said.  “I’m hopeful we can move quickly to pass this bipartisan legislation through the Senate.”
“Congress has talked about addressing the problem of patent trolls since 2005, when Senator Leahy and I first began work on what is now the America Invents Act.  I’m pleased that after a decade of serious policy discussions there is now strong bipartisan support for legislation to combat abusive patent lawsuits and safeguard American innovation. Effective patent troll legislation must provide a mechanism to ensure that defendants can recover fees even against judgment-proof shell companies.  With the addition of a strong fee recovery provision that I have long championed, the PATENT Act now does just that.  Having worked closely with stakeholders and innovators of all sizes and across many sectors, I am confident this bill can be enacted into law and finally end the plague of patent trolls on our economy,” Hatch said.
“This bipartisan legislation takes commonsense steps to protect patent holders against patent trolls, without impinging on the ability of good-faith actors to enforce their patent rights. Minnesota has one of the highest rates of patents per capita in the nation—we’ve invented everything from the Post-It Note to the pacemaker—and this bill will help our businesses and those across the country reap the reward of their innovations, while being protected from abusive lawsuits,” Klobuchar said.
The Key provisions of the Patent Act are below
Clarifies Pleading Standards.
The bill would establish clear, uniform standards for pleading in patent infringement suits to give defendants real notice of the claims against them, and keep meritless lawsuits from clogging federal court dockets.  It also increases transparency by requiring early disclosures about the patent-in-suit.
Protects End Users.
The bill protect customers who are targeted for patent infringement based on a product they simply purchased from a manufacturer or off the shelf by allowing the stay of an infringement case against an end user of a product while the manufacturer of the product litigates the alleged infringement.
Reasonably Limits Early Discovery.
The legislation protects litigants from the threat of expensive discovery by requiring a court to stay discovery while it resolves key early motions in the case, including motions to dismiss and transfer venue.  The bill also directs the Judicial Conference to develop rules about how much a party should bear the cost of discovery beyond what is core for the case.
Creates Risk for Bad Actors.
In order to deter plaintiffs and defendants from engaging in abusive and dilatory litigation practices, the bill provides that reasonable attorney fees will be awarded if the winner proves and a court rules that the losing party was not “objectively reasonable.”  The legislation provides a process to recover fees where the abusive litigant is hiding behind a shell company.
Curbs Abusive Demand Letters.
The legislation adds requirements that demand letters contain meaningful information so they cannot be used merely to scare recipients into early settlements.  The bill also heightens penalties for those found to violate the FTC Act by sending misleading demand letters.
Increases Transparency.
The bill requires the PTO to keep information about patent ownership in order to provide a resource about patents being asserted in a demand letter or lawsuit.

Title: Bipartisan Coalition Led By Senators Lee and Leahy Introduce Legislation To Ban Bulk Collection Under Section 215
Date: April 28, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) on Tuesday introduced legislation to restore Americans’ eroded privacy rights by ending the government’s dragnet collection of phone records under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  An identical bill was introduced in the House on Tuesday, and lawmakers from across the political spectrum called on Congressional leaders to take up the measure ahead of a key deadline for expiring surveillance authorities.
The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 ends bulk collection under Section 215 and requires greater oversight, transparency, and accountability with respect to domestic surveillance authorities.  Three provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), including Section 215, are due to sunset on June 1.
Last Congress, Senator Leahy convened six hearings of the Judiciary Committee to examine the scope of the bulk collection program and the need for greater transparency.  Senators Lee and Leahy also joined together last year with a host of bipartisan cosponsors to introduce the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014.  Unfortunately, that legislation was blocked from consideration in November.  Since then, both Senators have continued to work across the aisle and with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to find a way forward to end bulk collection of Americans’ data under Section 215.
Senator Lee said: “The Fourth Amendment safeguards liberty by protecting against government abuse of power.  Indiscriminate collection of data about Americans is a dangerous tool in the hands of government.  Members of Congress cannot continue to grant such broad discretion to secretive government agencies.  Our liberty is threatened when government claims the power to spy on its own citizens.  That is why I am co-sponsoring the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 which finds the proper balance national security and privacy.”
Senator Leahy said:  “Today we are introducing a bill to end the NSA’s bulk collection program.  The bipartisan, bicameral USA FREEDOM ACT of 2015 is the product of intense and careful negotiations between the House and Senate.  If enacted, our bill will usher in the most significant reform to government surveillance authorities since the USA PATRIOT Act.  I commend Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman Nadler for their bipartisan efforts in the House.  Together with our coalition in the Senate, we show today that there is a bipartisan path forward to end the NSA’s dragnet surveillance and protect Americans’ privacy rights.”
The Senate version of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 released today is cosponsored by Senators Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).  It also has the support of the administration, privacy groups, and the technology industry.   An identical bill was introduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers (D-Mich.), Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), and others.
An outline of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 can be found here, and text of legislation can be found online.
Broad Support for the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015
Senator Dean Heller (R-Nev.): “I strongly believe Nevadans and all Americans are losing too much of their privacy under current law.  The PATRIOT Act needs to be repealed and replaced with the USA FREEDOM Act, which stops the collection of bulk metadata housed at the NSA without degrading the operational capabilities of the intelligence community to protect the United States from terror attacks.  I am proud to stand with this bipartisan group of lawmakers who also believe we have gone too far and invaded the privacy of Americans.  I look forward to voting in favor of this legislation and against any reauthorization of the PATRIOT ACT without significant reforms like those outlined in USA FREEDOM.”
Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.): “Safeguarding the privacy of our citizens while protecting America’s national security is one of the most important issues facing Congress today, and striking that balance is no easy task.  This bill will make critical reforms to the government’s bulk collection of Americans’ telephone and internet records, and put in place measures to increase transparency and accountability in our national security agencies.  With new threats to America emerging constantly and at a time of alarming reports of overreach by our intelligence gathering operations, I hope Congress can advance these crucial bipartisan reforms.”
Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “A clean reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act’s bulk record collection program is not acceptable.  It is absolutely critical for Congress to balance the privacy interests of law-abiding citizens against the public’s interest in national security.  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 strikes the right balance by ending the National Security Agency’s unfettered data collection program and implementing other surveillance reforms, while at the same time preserving the government’s ability to obtain information to track down terrorists when it has sufficient justification and support for doing so.”
Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.):“The government has to give proper weight to keeping Americans safe and protecting both their security and privacy.  But the public can't know if we're striking that balance if they don't have even the most basic information about major surveillance programs.  That's why my focus in reforming the NSA has been on transparency.  I was pleased to see that the transparency provisions in the USA FREEDOM Act are based on bipartisan legislation I wrote with Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, because I want to make sure that the American people are able to decide for themselves whether the government is striking the right balance between privacy and security.”
Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.): “This measure will ban unnecessary bulk collection of Americans’ phone records and prevent the targeting of U.S. citizens helping to restore and retain public confidence and trust in our intelligence programs.  Doubt, suspicion, and distrust will only deepen without meaningful reform.  This historic step forward will preserve privacy rights of Americans while protecting our national security.  I am pleased that this legislation also includes provisions that will reform the FISA court including my proposal for a constitutional advocate to help secure constitutional rights.  These changes will help create balance and fairness in those proceedings.  There is still significant progress to be made to ensure Americans’ privacy rights are not threatened by government surveillance, but this legislation is a step in the right direction.”
Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.): “The American people have seen firsthand the dangers of big government’s intrusion into our daily lives, our personal information and our privacy.  It’s critical that comprehensive reforms are put in place to end the mass collection of Americans’ personal data and protect Americans’ civil liberties from the egregious abuses of power we’ve witnessed at the hands of the federal government.  I will keep fighting until Americans’ privacy and personal information is secure from government overreach.”
Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.): “This bill strikes the right balance between liberty and security.  The USA FREEDOM Act extends critical law enforcement tools, but it does so with safeguards that will help prevent abuse.  This is a strong bipartisan compromise that deserves strong support from both sides of the aisle.”

Title: Lee, Klobuchar Commend Agency Oversight on Comcast Merger
Date: April 24, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today released the following statements reacting to Comcast Corp.’s decision not to merge with Time Warner Cable:
“Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner raised antitrust concerns in both the video and broadband markets,” Lee said. “As chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice urging them to carefully review the merger’s effects on competition. I am glad these agencies took our concerns seriously. I look forward to continuing my oversight work with Senator Klobuchar this Congress.  We are both committed to ensuring vigorous competition and protection for consumers in this market.”
“Today’s announcement further illustrates the important role that antitrust enforcement continues to play protecting consumers in quickly changing technology markets,” Klobuchar said. "Both the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Communications Commission thoroughly examined the proposed Comcast/Time Warner merger and concluded that the transaction raised serious concerns, including those that Senator Lee and I highlighted last year around the effect on competition. As ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I will continue to work with Senator Lee to monitor and review potential consolidation in the communications marketplace to protect consumers and preserve competition.”

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted today against confirmation of Loretta Lynch to be the next Attorney General. The U.S. Senate confirmed Lynch’s nomination 56-43.
“Loretta Lynch is a talented and accomplished lawyer with all the credentials and qualifications necessary to be Attorney General,” Lee said. “Unfortunately during her confirmation hearing she was not forthcoming on a number of essential issues, most importantly on the question of the extent of prosecutorial discretion and executive power.  I am not persuaded that she would be any different than her predecessor in the job: recalcitrant with Congress, unwilling to answer questions, supportive of unlimited Executive power.  I hope she proves me wrong.”

Title: Lee Questions Witness At Hearing On Asset Forfeiture
Date: April 16, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—On Wednesday, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) participated in a Senate Judiciary hearing titled “The Need to Reform Asset Forfeiture.”  The hearing provided an opportunity to discuss the problems with Civil Asset Forfeiture and consider reforms to these laws.
Lee delivered the following opening statement prior to questioning witness Darpana Sheth, attorney for the Institute of Justice:
"The Constitution states that no person shall 'be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' Despite this protection, the testimony today and recent news reports suggest that Due Process is often ignored when it comes to Civil Asset Forfeiture. While we all agree that crime should not pay, federal forfeiture laws have enabled and incentivized law enforcement practices that threaten our liberty. That’s why I am a cosponsor of the FAIR Act with my colleague Rand Paul.  I look forward to working with my fellow legislators to eliminate the profit incentive that forfeiture creates and to adopt procedures that better protect our constitutional rights."
Lee’s opening statement and question regarding the need to eliminate profit incentives in the federal system.
Lee’s question on returning the burden of proof to the federal government
Federal law currently allows law enforcement officers to keep property that they seize from those who are committing federal crimes. This practice, known as Civil Asset Forfeiture, is an important law enforcement tool to make sure that crime does not pay. However, because these laws allow police departments to keep the money that they seize, they create incentives for officers to focus on self-funding, even at the risk of violating constitutional rights.
Lee is a cosponsor of Senator Rand Paul’s (R-KY) Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act of 2015 (FAIR Act), which eliminates the profit incentive for law enforcement officers and adopts procedures—such as notice and hearing rights, the right to an attorney, and higher burden of proof—that will better protect the rights of innocent property owners.

Title: Lee Introduces Amendment to Enforce "Paygo" Rules for Changes in Medicare Payments
Date: April 14, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Lee introduced an amendment to prevent the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 from adding $141 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade.  Lee's amendment would require Congress to make this bill comply with its normal "Pay As You Go" budget rules.  "To put it very simply: paying for this new spending is the right thing to do," Lee said in a floor speech introducing his amendment.  "My amendment would not delay or change anything else in the bill – doctors and seniors won’t notice any difference. It would just require Congress to budget for the costs – just like we promised we would when the Senate passed a budget resolution two weeks ago."
Senator Lee's full remarks can be found below:
We are here today because our Medicare status quo is not working. And it hasn’t been working for a long time.
For decades, Medicare has been on a path to insolvency. In 1997 Congress attempted to impose some fiscal discipline on the program by creating the “sustainable growth rate,” or SGR.
This is a budget-enforcing mechanism that calls for annual adjustments to the amounts physicians are reimbursed for treating Medicare patients.
The SGR was originally billed as a permanent solution to Medicare’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. The idea was to restrain Medicare spending by linking physician reimbursements to a target amount based on the general performance of the economy.
While this may have seemed like a good idea at the time – when the economy was relatively strong and stable – it quickly lost its appeal when we went into the 2001 recession.
The plan also suffered from the central planner’s fatal conceit that trusts bureaucracies, rather than consumer preferences and real price pressures, to determine the cost of a good or service.
As it turns out, the actual cost of medical goods and services and the practice patterns of physicians do not necessarily align with the health of the economy or the predictions of bureaucrats.
So each year since 2003, the SGR formula has called for cuts to physician payments. And each year – often several times a year – Congress has passed legislation to temporarily prevent the reimbursement reductions from kicking in.
While these so-called “doc fix” bills have yielded some modest savings, as new spending has traditionally been offset with cuts elsewhere in the budget, they have not restrained the quickening pace of Medicare spending.
And while they have successfully avoided cuts to doctors’ pay, they have put the Medicare system in a near-constant state of uncertainty and instability – leaving Medicare doctor’s and their patients hanging in the balance.
America’s physicians and seniors deserve better than this.
But they also deserve better than the bill before us today – H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015.
Congress has long wanted to repeal the SGR – and with good reason. But this is not the way to do it.
Not only does the House bill double down on Medicare’s broken price control model, but it does so, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while adding $141 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade.
Let’s look first at the policy implications of the underlying bill.
The new payment scheme proposed in this bill is simply more of the same inefficient form of central planning that further embeds Washington bureaucracy into every aspect of our health care system.
It continues the role of the federal government as price setter, rather than the price taker, in the free market. And it inflates the Administration’s power as regulator and compliance officer.
The principal change proposed by H.R. 2 is to move from a Medicare payment system based on volume to one based on bureaucratic measures of quality and value.
But we already know this doesn’t work, because it’s the same policy introduced under Obamacare that requires physicians to comply with government-established guidelines and stick to rigid one-size-fits-all best practices or pay a penalty.
Instead, we should be freeing the health care community from heavy-handed regulation and constant bureaucratic scrutiny.
Doing so is the only way to allow doctors to develop individualized, quality treatment plans for each of their patients, and to unleash innovation in health care delivery.
But with the current doc fix expiring tomorrow, and Medicare physicians facing a 21 percent pay cut, there is not enough time to re-open the bill and rewrite it with better policy.
But there is enough time to address the fiscal irresponsibility of this bill.
That’s why I’m offering an amendment to this bill that would simply require Congress to pay for that $141 billion under its normal “Pay As You Go” budget rules... rules that this bill explicitly exempts itself from, in Section 525.
The “Pay As You Go” budgeting rules – which share bipartisan support in Congress and the White House – wouldn’t force us to offset the new spending immediately.
Rather, we would have until the end of the year to find these savings and 10 years in which to achieve them.
My amendment would not delay or change anything else in the bill – doctors and seniors won’t notice any difference. It would just require Congress to budget for the costs – just like we promised we would.
Indeed, just two weeks ago, the Senate passed a 10-year balanced budget, stating specifically that any SGR-patch or repeal would not add to the deficit.
So passing this bill in its current form would not only be irresponsible – it would be dishonest.
Now, we have known for a long time that Medicare cannot survive without structural changes to its price control system. And we know that this bill, H.R. 2, does not contain such reforms.
According to a report issued last week by Medicare’s actuaries, [QUOTE] “under the new payment system, most doctors will see cuts in 2025.”
The only way to put Medicare on a sound fiscal footing is to make it work for America’s doctors and seniors.
To do that we need to work toward replacing the centralized price-fixing system of the status quo with a functional consumer market that empowers seniors to access the high-quality, individualized care they deserve and that enables doctors to do what they do best – provide the very best medical treatment in the entire world.
This is my goal. And I believe it is a goal widely shared in this chamber. But we can’t deceive ourselves: to get there, we must be responsible with the public trust and we must be honest with ourselves. To that end, I implore my colleagues to support this amendment.
To put it very simply: paying for this new spending is the right thing to do. And we just passed a budget promising that we would do it. My amendment does nothing more than hold us to that very promise.

Title: Lee Introduces, Senate Approves Amendment to Improve PILT Funding
Date: March 27, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Last night, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced an amendment to help local governments in Utah and other western states recover fair compensation from the federal government for its land ownership, by fully funding the Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILT) program. Senator Lee’s amendment (#750) was agreed to by the Senate, receiving 56 votes from his colleagues.
Watch Senator Lee’s floor speech on Amendment #750 here
See below for Sen. Lee’s full remarks, as prepared for delivery:
“The federal government owns almost two-thirds of the land in Utah and almost half of the land in the 11 coterminous states west of the Continental Divide. But unlike other property owners, the federal government does not pay property taxes on the land that it owns in these states.
As a result, areas with high concentrations of federal land – like most of Utah – face budget shortfalls that affect the ability of local governments to fund their education, transportation, and infrastructure systems, as well as their emergency services.
To help compensate local governments for this loss of property tax revenue, the federal government created the PILT program – which stands for Payment In Lieu of Taxes – to provide funding to these affected jurisdictions. But this funding is woefully inadequate.
Historically, PILT payments tend to be a small fraction of what the state and local governments could generate through property taxes if they owned the land within their borders. This results in underfunded schools, infrastructure, and other community services.
To correct the damage caused by this unfair system, I’m offering an amendment that would allow the Budget Committee to make PILT payments roughly equivalent to the property tax revenue that state and local governments would be able to raise if they owned the land.
This amendment is essential to ensure that the citizens of Utah, and of the West generally, have the public services they deserve.

Title: Lee, Hatch Announce Plans to Introduce FTC Reform Bill
Date: March 13, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) announced that they plan to introduce legislation in the Senate to reform and modernize the application of our antitrust laws, by harmonizing the rules governing how the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) review proposed mergers and acquisitions. Based on recommendations made by the Antitrust Modernization Commission in a 2007 report, the bill would require the FTC and DOJ to satisfy the same standard to obtain a preliminary injunction to block a merger and would eliminate existing disparities between the procedures the two agencies use in merger litigation. Lee and Hatch said they look forward to continuing discussions with the FTC and the House of Representatives, which introduced reform legislation last Congress. That bill, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules (SMARTER) Act (H.R. 5402), was introduced by Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) and reported out of the House Judiciary Committee on a voice vote last year.
“The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission share concurrent jurisdiction to review proposed mergers for compliance with our nation’s antitrust laws, and yet the two agencies can use different procedures in applying the same laws,” said Sen. Lee. “Senator Hatch and I favor sensible, responsible reform measures that equalize the standards and procedures governing how the FTC and DOJ litigate merger cases. There’s no reason that companies need to confront two different sets of rules when preparing to undergo a merger review process with the federal government.”
Senator Hatch said: “This is an important issue for the business community and for all Americans. There is no good reason for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to apply different standards in enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Businesses seeking to merge deserve consistent treatment without regard to which agency decides to review the merger. I look forward to working with Senator Lee and with my other colleagues on much-needed reforms to improve the merger review process.”

Title: Lee Holds Hearing on the Future of Music Licensing and Antitrust Regulations
Date: March 10, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee held his first hearing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, titled “How Much For a Song?: The Antitrust Decrees that Govern the Market for Music.” The purpose of the hearing was to evaluate the state of competition in the market for music licenses and to provide an open, public forum for music industry actors to discuss how we can ensure a vibrant, healthy market in which the prices for music remain competitive for consumers.
“The primary goal of this Subcommittee is to ensure that consumers are protected from those who would abuse the marketplace,” Sen. Lee said. “Today, we’re focusing on consumers of music, especially the tens of millions of Americans who enjoy their music online using streaming services. The advent of streaming technology has introduced profound changes to the music industry, many of which have greatly benefitted consumers. This hearing will examine some of those changes and evaluate how our complex system of antitrust laws and regulations can be appropriately adapted to the changing landscape of the music industry so that the price of music continues to be competitive, while appropriately valuing the copyrights at issue.”
At the hearing, the Subcommittee will hear testimony from several industry professionals, including Mike Dowdle, the Vice President of Business Affairs and General Counsel for Bonneville International; Beth Matthews, CEO and General Counsel of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP); Chris Harrison, the Vice President of Business Affairs for Pandora Media, Inc.; Lee Thomas Miller, a songwriter with Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI); Matt Pincus, Founder and CEO of SONGS Music Publishing; and Jodie Griffin, Senior Staff Attorney for Public Knowledge.

Opening Statement
How Much for a Song?:
The Antitrust Decrees that Govern the Market for Music
Senator Mike Lee
March 10, 2015
Welcome.  This is the first hearing this Congress of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.  I’d like to begin by thanking my friend, Senator Klobuchar, for the tremendous job she did chairing this subcommittee before me.  She and I have always enjoyed working together, and we share the same basic goal for this subcommittee: ensuring, first, that consumers are protected from those who would abuse the marketplace and second, that we perform effective oversight of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and of the competition side of the Federal Trade Commission.  I look forward to continuing that bipartisan work this Congress, and I’d like to thank her and her staff for their hard work on this hearing.
I’d also like to thank the Chairman of the full committee, Senator Grassley, for his support for this hearing.  Senator Grassley was planning to be here today, but is stuck on the floor managing some human trafficking legislation.
A few housekeeping matters before we begin.  After Senator Klobuchar and I give some opening remarks about this hearing, we will hear from our panel of witnesses (who I’ll introduce later on), and then we will have five-minute question rounds.
If you’ll all indulge me, some background on this complicated subject is in order.  This hearing is about the market for music.  Specifically, it is about the market for licenses to publicly perform copyrighted musical compositions.  What does that mean?  Every song has an author—the person who
wrote
it, not necessarily the person who performed or recorded it.  And that author has a copyright in that song, meaning that anyone who wants to perform it in public needs a license from the author.  Which turns out to be a lot of people:  Lots of businesses play music for consumers:  Radio stations and Internet-streaming services like Pandora or iHeartRadio are the obvious examples, but there are all sorts of others:  Bars and restaurants that play music to set an ambience; retail stores that do the same thing; television networks and cable companies that air college football games with a marching band.  All those people need a license for every song they play — or else they have to pay enormous damages to the copyright holder.
But the market could not function if every neighborhood restaurant had to go look for every author of every song it wanted to play and negotiate with each one of those authors for license fees.  Nor do individual copyright holders have time to contact every bar in America and ask them for license payments. As a result, for more than 100 years, publishers and songwriters have relied on performing rights organizations (PROs) to license music on their behalf and then collect and distribute royalties.  The two largest PROs are called ASCAP and BMI, and we are pleased to have representatives of both as witnesses today.  Both ASCAP and BMI sell blanket licenses to all the works in their inventory—and between the two of them, those licenses will cover most every song.  Roughly speaking (and the number is debatable), ASCAP and BMI each control approximately 45 percent of the market.  The remaining 10 percent belongs to two other PROs, SESAC and Global Music Rights.
So what does this have to do with antitrust law?  Well, it turns out that virtually the entire market for the licenses we are talking about is governed by a pair of antitrust consent decrees from a long time ago.  In the 1940s, the Department of Justice separately sued ASCAP and BMI over concerns that they had violated the Sherman Act through aggregating control of the music-license market.  DOJ settled these cases and entered into separate consent decree with ASCAP and BMI in 1941.  These consent decrees are somewhat unusual:  They are perpetual in duration, and they essentially function as a regulatory system for the price of these music licenses.  The decrees contain requirements that look very much like a compulsory license and royalty scheme.  Specifically, they require that the PROs offer a fair rate, on a non-exclusive basis, to any user requesting a license, and that they not discriminate among similar licensees.  Any disputes about rates are to be resolved by the judge in the Southern District of New York who oversees the decree, a process that has come to be known as “rate court.”
For almost 75 years, the consent-decree-ruled ASCAP and BMI blanket licenses have allowed consumers of music to have access to virtually the entire catalog of written music by negotiating with just a few entities.  The system has allowed innovative distribution methods to arise while enabling individual songwriters to get royalties from thousands of bars, restaurants, and radio stations across the country.
Then came the Internet.  In 1995, after the advent of web-streaming, Congress decided to require Internet companies who publicly perform music (but no one else) to pay royalties to recording artists and record labels (the guys who play the songs, rather than the people who write them), in exchange for requiring the record labels to license their works.  In other words, Congress set up a scheme on the sound-recording side that looks very much like the scheme the consent decrees set up on the musical-composition side.  The major difference, however, is that the price of royalties for
composers
is ultimately controlled by antitrust judges, and the price of royalties for
recording artists
is controlled by the Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of administrative judges housed in the Library of Congress.
And these two groups of people do not agree about the price of a license to play music on the Internet.  The Royalty Board set rates for sound recordings played on internet radio that were substantially higher than those the rate court had set for the underlying compositions.  For example, in 2013, Pandora paid approximately 48 percent of its revenue to recording artists and record labels and only about 5 percent of its revenue to songwriters and publishers.  This disparity in rates led publishers to believe that they would be able to achieve better rates outside the consent decrees, so they asked ASCAP and BMI to change their membership rules to allow something called “partial withdrawal,” meaning the right to exclude digital services from the blanket licenses they normally sell.  That would require companies like Pandora to separately negotiate with publishers for public performance licenses at whatever price the market would bear.
All of that led to litigation that is still pending.  It also led to allegations that the music publishers (who think their judge-set royalty rates are too low) were colluding to keep Pandora’s prices high, instead of competing with each other to drive consumer prices down.  In a lengthy opinion, Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York ruled that publishers had no right to partially withdraw their digital rights from the blanket license under the ASCAP consent decree.  She also rejected publishers’ attempts to use the prices they negotiated with Pandora while they tried partial withdrawal as benchmarks for setting prices generally, noting evidence that the publishers had cooperated instead of competing in those negotiations. That case is pending on appeal.  And even as we speak, a different SDNY judge is now conducting a trial about similar questions under the BMI decree.
Meanwhile, DOJ’s Antitrust Division is currently considering modify the consent decrees to allow partial withdrawals, among other things.  That would have a number of important consequences that today’s panel can discuss.  On the one hand, the publishers say partial withdrawal will allow them to negotiate prices with Internet companies in a free market — and surely the most striking feature of the current system is that there is no free market at work.  On the other hand, others believe that after partial withdrawal, the market will not really
be
free — because a few music publishers control most of the licenses, and they have been accused in the past of colluding to drive up prices for consumers.
In short, what to do about these consent decrees is a hard problem, one that affects millions of Americans.  Today we will hear from a variety of parties affected by the consent decrees, each with a slightly different place in the market.  Here we have an opportunity to discuss openly the topics DOJ is discussing privately.  As we listen today, we must remember that we have both a responsibility to encourage creativity by recognizing the value of copyrights and a duty to ensure that prices for music remain competitive for consumers.

Title: Lee, DeSantis Introduce Bill to Expand Higher Education Opportunities
Date: March 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a bill that expands higher education opportunities for low-income and middle-class students and families, by opening up the federal accreditation system to state-based alternatives. The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) Act would allow all 50 states and the District of Columbia to develop their own systems of accrediting educational institutions, curricula, apprenticeships, job-training programs, and even individual courses, all of which would be eligible to receive federal student loan money.
In the House of Representatives, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) introduced companion legislation, which currently has twenty-five co-sponsors. There are currently four co-sponsors in the Senate: Sens. Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), and David Vitter (R-LA).
“The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act will not only make the higher education more affordable – it will also empower students to customize their own education and gain the specific skills they need to compete in today’s economy on a schedule that works for them,” Sen. Lee said. “Today’s higher education system is failing to keep up with students’ increasingly specialized educational needs and the demands of a highly competitive job market. The HERO Act will open the floodgates of innovation, providing greater choice, access, and opportunity for America’s students.”
“The acquisition of advanced knowledge and skills is more important than ever for economic opportunity, and many students would benefit from alternatives to traditional brick-and-ivy institutions, such as training programs, vocational schools, and apprenticeships,” said Rep. DeSantis. “By authorizing states to experiment with different approaches to accreditation, the HERO Act will allow our nation’s students to pursue the skills and education that they need to succeed in their chosen fields.”
The Senate co-sponsors issued the following statements on the HERO Act:
“By reforming our rigid accreditation model to allow greater flexibility, the HERO Act will provide students with increased educational opportunities and give them more control and choice over their individual education needs,” said Sen. Crapo. “It is long past time we eliminate the heavy hand of the federal government in education decisions that are best made on a local level.”
“America's students deserve better options and opportunities,” said Sen. Cruz. “The Department of Education's accreditation process needs to be reformed to allow more competition in higher education that will create more affordable choices for students, whether it's for a parent who wishes to attend night school, a recent high-school graduate who is interested in vocational training, or a professional seeking a graduate degree. I applaud Sen. Lee for his steadfast commitment to education and am proud to cosponsor this bill with him.”
“Students should be empowered to pursue educational opportunities that best fit their unique interests and career goals,” Sen. Daines stated. “The HERO Act encourages innovation in education while promoting accountability and results. By expanding access and opportunities for all students, we can ensure that future generations are fully prepared to enter the workforce and follow their career pursuits.”
“Education at all levels including higher education is best when decisions are made closest to the student – and that includes providing affordable choices for students,” Sen. Vitter said. “When higher education institutions can partner students with businesses and workforce training opportunities, everyone wins. This bill creates an important level of flexibility for states as well as more access and affordable choices for students.”

Title: Lee, Rubio Introduce Economic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan
Date: March 4, 2015

WASHINGTON. – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) today unveiled their Economic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan. In an effort to fix our broken tax code system, Lee and Rubio outlined their plan to eliminate the bias in the tax code against parents and families, encourage economic growth to create more jobs and better wages, and enhance the ability of businesses to compete globally.
An excerpt of Lee's remarks can be found below:
"The greatest driver of American prosperity is equal access to and equal opportunity within our free enterprise economy. That’s what spurs innovation, creates jobs, and drives up the take-home pay of working Americans.
"Today, in an ever more competitive global economy, the greatest impediments to economic opportunity and growth are unfair, dysfunctional government policies that have not kept up with changing times. These policies empower political insiders and crony capitalists elites at everyone else’s expense.
"One place where these policies are especially prevalent is the federal tax code. And so , Along with Sen. Marco Rubio, I am introducing a pro-growth, pro-family tax reform plan to correct these unfair, broken policies to level the playing field for all individuals, families, and businesses."

Title: Lee Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Increase Accountability Within the Department of Justice
Date: March 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – This week, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a bipartisan bill to improve transparency and increase accountability within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), by granting its Office of the Inspector General complete jurisdiction to investigate all allegations of misconduct by department personnel. Under The Inspector General Access Act (S. 618) the Inspector General would no longer be required to refer to the Office of Professional Responsibility cases involving alleged misconduct by DOJ attorneys, investigators, and law enforcement personnel. Co-sponsoring the legislation are Sens. Jon Tester (D-MT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).
“Congress created the Office of the Inspector General in order to establish an independent, and therefore impartial, entity within each federal agency that would investigate allegations of departmental misconduct,” said Sen. Lee. “But under current law, the Department of Justice is the only agency whose Inspector General does not have complete jurisdiction to carry out its mission. As a result, the American people have little assurance that the investigations into alleged misconduct by DOJ attorneys will be objective, transparent, and unencumbered by any conflict of interest. The Inspector General Access Act is a simple, common-sense solution that will bring the Department of Justice into harmony with all other federal agencies and help restore the American people’s trust in their public institutions.”
“Americans pledge to seek and protect ‘Liberty and Justice for All,’ not ‘Liberty and Justice for Most’ – and those enforcing the law themselves cannot break the rules to get convictions; everyone in America must be held equally accountable,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski. “I’m proud to co-sponsor the Inspector General Access Act because it does just that: it gives the men and women charged with judging the actions of attorneys the power to mete out justice within the Justice Department.”

Title: Lee Releases Statement on the FCC’s Decision to Regulate the Internet
Date: February 27, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee issued the following statement regarding the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to subject the Internet to federal regulation as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act:
“Earlier today three of the five unelected, politically appointed bureaucrats who currently sit as commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission voted to grant themselves and their agency the power to regulate the Internet – its millions of American users and trillions of dollars in economic activity – with the same antiquated rules designed for the monopolistic landline telephone industry in the 20th century.”
“This unprecedented move by the FCC is not only an egregious seizure of regulatory power and a clear violation of the 1996 Communications Act, which wisely prohibits the federal government from regulating broadband Internet services. It also begins in earnest the slow, suffocating, inevitable demise of the Internet as we know it today — the open and expansive universe and source of information, innovation, entertainment, and communication. What was previously bound only by the limits of the our imagination and the frontiers of our technology will now be suffocated by Washington bureaucrats, whose action today will benefit not internet consumers, entrepreneurs, and innovators,  but the well-connected special interests that stand to profit from the diminished competition that invariably follows heavy-handed government regulation.”
“The Internet has been one of the most productive and innovative sectors of our economy, flourishing even as the rest of our economy sputtered, precisely because it has been open and free of exactly this kind of government regulation. Today the FCC made clear that it has no interest in governing within the authority given to it by Congress and that it is eager to discard the objectivity that is expected of an independent, non-partisan agency, in favor of rank partisanship carried out on behalf of our imperious president. This being the case, Congress now has an obligation to reassess the proper role – if  any – of the FCC and to determine whether it does more harm than good in a 21st century world.”

Title: Lee: Congress Should Use It’s Power of the Purse to Prohibit the Implementation of Executive Amnesty
Date: February 27, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Lee spoke on the Senate floor before attempting to offer his amendment to H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. Senator Lee's amendment, number 265, would have prohibited DHS from spending any money to implement President Obama's executive action on immigration from November 2014 that unilaterally granted amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants, while keeping the Department fully funded. Joining Sen. Lee in offering amendment number 265 were Sens. David Vitter (R-La.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.).
Sen. Lee made two efforts to advance his amendment. He first requested an up-or-down vote, but was denied. Then, he forced a vote to open up the legislative process and remove a procedural mechanism blocking his amendment to the DHS funding legislation, rather than being forced to vote on a bill without an opportunity to amend it. Thirty-three of his colleagues voted with Senator Lee in support of an open and fair legislative process, but this was not enough to overcome the opposition.
"Although the amendment didn't have enough support to pass the Senate, the fight to forestall implementation of President Obama's executive amnesty is not over," Senator Lee said. "The DHS funding bill has been sent to the House of Representatives, giving Congress another chance to stand up for the American people and the rule of law, instead of acquiescing to the president's lawless demands."

Title: Lee Attends Bipartisan Meeting at White House on Criminal Justice Reform
Date: February 25, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee attended a bipartisan meeting at the White House to discuss the need to modernize and reform our criminal justice system. President Obama invited Senator Lee and several members of Congress, from both parties, to join him and Vice President Biden for a conversation on how to address the challenges of over-criminalization, over-incarceration, and over-sentencing in America.
“After a generation of tough-on-crime policies helped make communities around the country safer, many of our federal criminal justice laws are now out of date, counterproductive, and unfair,” said Sen. Lee. “Given the immense financial and human cost of our broken status quo, I was pleased to join President Obama and my congressional colleagues today for a dialogue to find bipartisan solutions to these problems. ”
One of the solutions discussed during the meeting was the Smarter Sentencing Act, a bill that Senator Lee recently introduced in the Senate with Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), which would modernize our federal drug sentencing laws and provide immediate relief to an overburdened prison system.
The Smarter Sentencing Act is a common-sense reform that will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses, while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to the families and communities that need them.
After the meeting Senator Lee said, “I’m hopeful that the Senate will take up this bipartisan piece of legislation sometime soon, and in the meantime I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues across the aisle to find sensible solutions to our nation’s most pressing problems.”

Title: Lee Holds Bicameral Press Conference on DHS Funding Bill
Date: February 12, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee held a bicameral press conference to highlight the need for the Senate to proceed to debate on the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. That funding bill, which was passed by the House, would fully fund DHS and prohibit President Obama from using any funds to implement his lawless executive amnesty plan. Joining Sen. Lee at the press conference were Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well as many of his colleagues from the House of Representatives.
“For two weeks, Senate Republicans have been trying to fund the Department of Homeland Security,” said Sen. Lee. “And yet here we are today – with 15 days until DHS funding expires – no closer to passing a funding bill than we were two weeks ago, because Senate Democrats have repeatedly used and abused procedural tactics to block the legislative process. Now is the time to end the partisan politics and the obstruction of democracy so we can begin the debate over the future of homeland security.”

Title: Lee, Durbin Introduce Smarter Sentencing Act of 2015
Date: February 12, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) were joined by U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) to announce legislation to modernize federal drug sentencing polices by giving federal judges more discretion in sentencing those convicted of non-violent drug offenses.
With federal prison populations skyrocketing and about half of the nation’s federal inmates serving sentences for drug offenses, the proposed changes could save American taxpayers billions of dollars in the first years of enactment.
“Mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses have played a huge role in the explosion of the U.S. prison population,”Durbin said. “Once seen as a strong deterrent, these mandatory sentences have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety. Given tight budgets and overcrowded prison cells, judges should be given the authority to conduct an individualized review in sentencing certain drug offenders and not be bound to outdated laws that have proven not to work and cost taxpayers billions.”
“Our current federal sentencing laws are out of date, they are often counterproductive, and in far too many cases in Utah and around the country they are unjust,” said Lee. “The Smarter Sentencing Act is a commonsense solution that will greatly reduce the financial and, more importantly, the human cost imposed on society by the broken status quo. The SSA will give judges the flexibility and discretion they need to impose stiff sentences on the most serious drug lords and cartel bosses, while enabling nonviolent offenders to return more quickly to their families and communities.”
The United States has seen a 500 percent increase in the number of inmates in federal custody over the last 30 years, and almost 50 percent of those federal inmates are serving sentences for drug offenses. Mandatory sentences, particularly drug sentences, can force a judge to impose a one-size-fits-all sentence without taking into account the details of an individual case. Many of these sentences have disproportionately affected minority populations and helped foster distrust of the criminal justice system.
This large increase in the prison population has put a strain on our prison infrastructure and federal budgets. The Bureau of Prisons is more than 30 percent over capacity and this severe overcrowding puts both inmates and guards at risk. This focus on incarceration is also diverting increasingly limited funds from law enforcement and crime prevention to housing federal inmates, the cost of which has increased by more than 1100 percent. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementation of these reforms would save taxpayers approximately $3 billion over ten years.

Title: Lee, Flores: Time to End Democrat Obstruction of DHS Funding Bill
Date: February 10, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, Chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, and Congressman Bill Flores of Texas, Chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, released the following statements regarding Senate Democrats’ repeated obstruction of the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, H.R. 240:
Statement from Senator Mike Lee (R-UT): “Republicans are trying to keep our promise to the American people and do what they sent us here to do: keep the government funded, especially the agencies protecting our homeland security, and hold the President accountable for his abuses of power.  But standing in the way are Senate Democrats who refuse to even allow consideration of the DHS funding bill so they won’t have to declare where they stand on the President’s illegal and unconstitutional action on executive amnesty.  This effort to try and hide from the American people is embarrassing. Republican leaders in the Senate have repeatedly signaled that they will give Democrats every opportunity to amend provisions of the bill that they don’t like.  But even this is rejected, because it would require Democrats to go on record as supporting or opposing the president’s executive amnesty. Instead they have chosen to create this hostage situation.  That is shameful.  Let’s put an end to the obstruction and start the process for funding our homeland security.”
Statement from RSC Chairman Bill Flores (R-TX): “Rather than work toward funding the Department of Homeland Security, Senate Democrats are choosing to block the process entirely.  Their obstructionist tactics do a disservice to the American voters who sent us to Washington to lead. Congressional Republicans are unified in their desire to move forward to provide homeland security in a responsible manner.  The House has passed a responsible bill that reflects the overwhelming disappointment of voters about the president’s lawless executive amnesty and fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. It is time for the Senate to act on that bill.”

Title: Bipartisan, Bicameral Group Introduces Bill to Protect Online Privacy
Date: February 4, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, a bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators introduced a bill to modernize our nation’s electronic privacy laws and bring protections against warrantless searches into harmony with the technological realities of the 21
st
century. The “Electronic Communications Privacy Amendments Act of 2015” (ECPA) was submitted in the Senate by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  Representatives Kevin Yoder (R-KS) and Jared Polis (D-CO) sponsored the House version of the bill.
“There is no reason we should still be operating under a law written in the analog age when we’re living in a digital world,” said Sen. Lee. “Yet that’s exactly what has happened with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which has remained virtually unchanged since it was first enacted in 1986. In the nearly three decades since ECPA became law, technology has advanced rapidly and beyond the imagination of anyone living in 1986. The prevalence of email and the low cost of electronic data storage have made what were once robust protections insufficient to ensure that citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights are adequately protected.”
“The bill we are introducing today protects Americans’ digital privacy – in their emails, and all the other files and photographs they store in the cloud.  It builds consumer trust, and it provides law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to ensure public safety,” Sen. Leahy said. “This is a bipartisan issue, and now is the time to act swiftly to bring our privacy protections into the digital age.”
“The federal government is using an arcane 1986 law to conduct warrantless searches of the personal email accounts and other digital communication of the American people,” said Rep. Yoder. “The last time Congress updated our email privacy laws, we were two years removed from the release of the first Macintosh computer. It’s time Congress modernized these outdated statutes to ensure that the rights protected by the Fourth Amendment extend to Americans’ email correspondence and digital storage.”
“For too long now Americans’ electronic communications have been subject to invasive and unwarranted searches based on laws written for the Apple 2, not the iPhone 6,” said Rep. Jared Polis. “Today, a majority of the House of Representatives is standing up to say that the government has no more business reading your personal email than it does reading your physical mail. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this bipartisan bill and make a reasonable expectation of privacy the law for all forms of communication.”
The Lee-Leahy-Yoder-Polis ECPA Amendments Act of 2015 shows how outdated laws can be improved through bipartisan, commonsense reforms. The bill protects Americans’ email and other data held in the cloud by requiring law enforcement agencies to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before accessing it.  It replaces the obsolete “180-day rule,” which some government agencies invoke to claim warrantless access to older emails.
The Senate bill has 6 additional cosponsors, Republican Senators Cornyn, Moran, and Gardner, and Democratic Senators Shaheen, Blumenthal, and Merkley.  The House version of ECPA has 227 additional cosponsors.
This legislation is also carefully crafted so it does not impede the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations. As such, the ECPA Amendments Act of 2015 enjoys broad support from the technology industry, privacy advocates, constitutional scholars, and policy groups across the ideological spectrum.

Title: Lee: Let’s Begin Debate on DHS Funding, Executive Amnesty
Date: February 2, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee said the Senate should begin debate on the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that recently passed the House of Representatives.  He said the debate would give senators the opportunity to weigh in on President Obama’s executive action.
“
I
am ready – indeed, I am
eager
– to begin this debate,” said Sen. Lee. “Not just because we have only twenty-five days before the current budget authority for DHS expires. But also because this debate will finally allow the American people to see where their elected representatives in the Senate stand on President Obama’s recent executive action on immigration.”
Polls have shown that the American people oppose not only the result of the President’s action that would give work permits to millions of illegal aliens, but they also oppose the way Obama ignored the Constitution and went around Congress to change immigration law.
“Even those who agree with the president on the underlying policy disagree with him on the
process, “ Lee argued. “According to one poll, when asked if the president should ‘sidestep Congress and act on his own using executive orders,’ only 22% of the public said that he should. In other words, the American people know what our president seems to have forgotten: that in a constitutional republic the ends don’t justify the means.”
Senate Republicans are set to vote on beginning debate on the DHS funding bill tomorrow, though several Senate Democrats have vowed to block debate.
“Some have said that we shouldn’t be debating the president’s executive action on immigration right now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a simple reply: ‘if not now, then when?’”
“The truth is that now is the perfect time – because it’s the only time – for us to have a meaningful debate on the president’s executive action on immigration,” Lee said.
Senator Lee’s full remarks (As prepared for delivery):
Mr./Madam President, tomorrow afternoon the Senate will vote to begin consideration of H.R. 240 – a bill that authorizes funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through September of this year.
This is a
procedural
vote, not a
substantive
one. The only question on the table is whether or not the Senate is ready to begin debating H.R. 240?
Well, Mr./Madam President,
I
am ready – indeed, I am
eager
– to begin this debate. Not just because we have only twenty-five days before the current budget authority for DHS expires. But also because this debate will finally allow the American people to see where their elected representatives in the Senate stand on President Obama’s recent executive action on immigration.
Mr./Madam President, the legislature is the only
lawmaking
branch in our government because it’s the only
deliberative
branch in our government.
Before Congress enacts a piece of legislation, we first debate the merits of that legislation – weighing the pros and cons, in a candid and transparent discussion, and allowing the various sides of the issue to make their case.
Open, robust debate is not
incidental
to the lawmaking process – it is
the essence
of the lawmaking process. It’s the only way for members of Congress to fully explore the costs and consequences of a policy. And it’s the only way for the American people to know
where
their elected officials stand on an issue and
why
.
When the president announced in November of last year that he was going to singlehandedly rewrite our immigration laws, he short-circuited this process of debate and deliberation that’s at the heart of our constitutional lawmaking process.
His announcement showed us what it looks like when one person ignores the limits of his office and claims the power to change the law all on his own. Policies are written behind closed doors, in consultation with lawyers and special interest groups, rather than the American people. And the law is pronounced from behind a podium – as a fait accompli – rather than discussed in an open and fair contest of ideas.
This, Mr./Madam President, is
not
how our democracy works. And it is not what the American people expect from their elected officials.
Indeed, poll after poll shows that most people disapprove of the president’s executive action on immigration. Even those who agree with the president on the underlying
policy
disagree with him on
the process
.
According to one poll, when asked if the president should [
QUOTE
] “sidestep Congress and act on his own using executive orders,” only 22% of the public said that he should.
In other words, the American people know what our president seems to have forgotten: that in a constitutional republic the ends don’t justify the means.
The American people oppose lawmaking by fiat not out of some abstract loyalty to the separation of powers. Rather, they understand that when a president sidesteps Congress and avoids open, robust debate on a policy, it’s probably because the public won’t like the substance of that policy.
This is certainly what we’ve seen in the aftermath of the president’s executive orders on immigration. The more that people discover about the content and the consequences of his policy, the less they like it.
For instance, the president claimed that his executive order would honor the golden rule of American exceptionalism – that “if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead.”
But we now know that his plan subverts this basic bargain, by paving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have broken the rules and violated the law, and by granting them work permits and benefits, like Social Security and Medicare.
Likewise, we were told that the president’s executive order would make our immigration system more fair and more functional for everyone.
But we now know that his plan will only exacerbate the problems in our labor market for American workers, by giving
more
power and
more
money to the dysfunctional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) – this is the agency within DHS that was recently reported to have given over 900,000 work permits to illegal immigrants since 2009.
And we know that, unless we do something to stop it, the president’s executive order will go into effect at a time when all net jobs growth in our economy since 2007 has gone to immigrants.
Mr./Madam President, these are the kinds of facts and figures that ought to
inform
the lawmaking process, not be treated as an afterthought.
Last November the president may have chosen to ignore these facts and to circumvent debate, but that doesn’t mean we must respond in kind.
On the contrary, I believe we have an obligation to make every effort to ensure that lawmaking by edict does not become the new normal in this country.
Beginning debate on this bill will give us the opportunity to do just that.
Some have said that we shouldn’t be debating the president’s executive action on immigration right now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a simple reply: “if not now, then
when
?”
If we don’t debate the legality of the president’s executive orders when we are in the process of authorizing money to the department that is tasked with carrying out those orders, then when exactly will we have that debate?
The truth is that now is the perfect time – because it’s the only time – for us to have a meaningful debate on the president’s executive action on immigration.
At any other point, our debate is merely hypothetical. Now is the time, when we are exercising our constitutional power of the purse, that our debate has consequences.
The power of the purse is the power to allocate money to fund government operations, as well as the power to withhold money from improper or illegitimate government operations. It’s what enables Congress – and
only
Congress – to reform dysfunctional government.
We like to talk about the power of the purse as a tool that Congress can use to check and balance the excesses of an overbearing president.
And that’s absolutely true. But first and foremost it’s a tool for members of Congress to represent the interests of our constituents and fix what’s broken in our government.
Our Constitution grants the legislature the power of the purse not simply to achieve some abstract equilibrium or balance of power, but to compel the national government to represent the American people and be faithful stewards of taxpayer money.
Mr./Madam President, at the end of November last year, President Obama made his choice, now it’s time for us to make ours.
The president chose to sidestep Congress, avoid debate, and rewrite our immigration laws on his own. Now we must decide: are we going to be a deliberative body or are we going to be a rubberstamp for the president’s agenda?
Are we going to acquiesce to an executive disregards the boundaries of his office, or are we going to stand up for the rule of law and the will of the people?
I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to begin debate on H.R. 240. This is a debate that the American people have been waiting for Congress to have for far too long.

Title: Lee, Messer Introduce Bill to Give Parents More Control Over K-12 Education Decisions
Date: January 29, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Congressman Luke Messer of Indiana introduced legislation to make a quality K-12 education more accessible and affordable to low-income parents and students. The “Enhancing Educational Opportunities for All Act” significantly empowers parents by giving them greater control over choosing a school that’s best for their child, as well as more flexibility in planning and saving for education-related expenses.
“There is no group that cares more about the future of this country than America’s moms and dads,” said Lee. “They have the awesome responsibility of raising the next generation and making sure our kids are ready to meet the challenges to come.  That’s exactly why they deserve more control over their children’s education than current federal policy allows.  We should do everything in our power to remove the obstacles preventing America's parents from choosing the best education options for their children."
“For our students to compete in the 21st Century global economy, they need to have access to a high-quality education,” said Congressman Luke Messer. “Right now, that’s not a reality for too many kids.  The Enhancing Educational Opportunities for all Students Act will not only help make access to a great education possible for more students, but also more affordable for families.”
The “Enhancing Educational Opportunities for All Act” has three primary components aimed at making sure that educational decision-making authority resides in the home with parents and guardians, not with federal bureaucrats in Washington.
The first provision provides for full Title I portability which would allow Title I funds to follow low-income students to any public or private school of their choice.
The second provision takes the much-needed step of removing contribution limitations on Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. Coverdell Accounts are the lone tax break available to parents for kindergarten through twelfth grade expenses.
The final provision expands “529” Savings Accounts to K-12 elementary and secondary education expenses, providing a second option available to families to pay for K-12 educational expenses.
“All students should have access to a high quality education. This legislation will empower parents to invest more in heir child's education and allow parents to choose what school best meets their child's needs,” Lee added.

Title: Lee to Chair Antitrust Subcommittee, Klobuchar Will be Ranking Member
Date: January 26, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced that he will chair the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as the Ranking Member.
"This important subcommittee ensures that our nation’s antitrust laws are faithfully executed and that, above all, consumers are protected through proper congressional oversight of the free-market competition that generates economic growth and sustains consumer welfare,"
said Lee.
"My goal is to protect the free market as place where competition can thrive, ideas can flourish, regulatory costs are limited, and consumers are the final arbiters of who wins and loses.  For the past two years, Senator Klobuchar and I have had a productive bipartisan working relationship and I am certain we will continue making progress in the same way.  I look forward to continuing our good work."
“Our economy is strongest when we look out for consumers, promote innovation, and ensure our businesses are competing on a fair and level playing field,” Klobuchar said. “Senator Lee and I have worked together on the Antitrust Subcommittee to protect consumers and support innovation in our economy, and I’m looking forward to continuing that important work in the new Congress.”
Senators Lee and Klobuchar said that this Congress the Subcommittee will continue the Subcommittee’s oversight of antitrust enforcement at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, as well as examine important developments in competition policy and proposed reforms to our antitrust laws.  The Subcommittee will also continue its work investigating the state of competition in a variety of industries—including the Internet sharing economy, music performance licenses, online and television media and video services, wireless and broadband connections, prescription drugs, and many others.  The Senators said they will continue to help ensure that competition thrives, our antitrust laws are sound, and consumer welfare remains protected.

Title: Lee Fights Red Tape on Federal Lands
Date: January 23, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee offered an amendment that would make federal permitting for oil and gas development more efficient and force the Bureau of Land Management to follow current law requiring all applications to be approved or deniedyapplications within 30 days.  Lee said there is no justifiable reason for delays amounting to hundreds of days and that his bill, and the greater certainty it would bring, would improve economic and national security.
“This amendment would solve a problem that has severely hamstrung oil and gas development on federal lands, a problem that's particularly severe in the western United States, and that involves excessive delays in the issuing of permits by the United States Bureau of Land Management,” Lee said of his amendment to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act.  “The result of all this red tape is a serious backlog of about 3,500 permits.”
“There are currently 113 million acres of federal lands open and accessible for oil and gas development. Much of this federal land contains abundant domestic energy resources,” Lee said on the Senate floor. “In Utah alone, we have hundreds of acres available for drilling, acres that are currently being held up by bureaucratic delays. My amendment would ensure that Utah and other states in the west that are dominated by federal land can access the energy, the vast wealth that lies within their borders and provide the United States with a reliable source of domestic energy production.”
“It makes sense economically and…from a national security standpoint, as well,” He added. “But in order for any of this to work, we have to have procedures in place to make sure that those people who choose to go out and develop federal land – that's already been identified as suitable for oil and gas production within federal lands – that they have some modicum of due process, that they have some ability to predict what the procedural outcome is going to be, what set of procedures they'll have to follow, and what kind of time line they will be facing as they approach this often lengthy process.”
Despite gaining the support of a bipartisan majority in the Senate, rules required the amendment to receive 60 votes in order to be added to the bill.  The amendment failed 51 – 47.
The full transcript of Sen. Lee’s statement on the Senate floor is below:
Mr. President, I stand today to encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, amendment number 71. This amendment would solve a problem that has severely hamstrung oil and gas development on federal lands, a problem that's particularly severe in the western United States, and that involves excessive delays in the issuing of permits by the United States Bureau of Land Management.
Federal law requires the BLM To approve or deny these permits within 30 days.
They've got 30 days. They can go one way or the other. But according to a report issued last year by the inspector general within the U. S. Department of Interior, BLM took an average of 228 days to approve each drilling permit in 2012. 228 days. That's 7 1/2 months. That's a lot longer than the 30 days contemplated under federal law. In Moab and in Salt Lake City, Utah, the average processing delay is around 220 days. In Price, Utah, the average processing delay is just under 250 days.
It doesn't have to take this long. In fact, to explain why, let's look at how states handle it. State governments, by comparison, process these same permits in 80 days or less. Approval of these permits is further complicated by endless environmental reviews, reviews that sometimes can take years upon years. The result of all this red tape is a serious backlog of about 3,500 permits.
My amendment would address this problem in a few ways. First, it would require BLM to issue a permit within 60 days of receiving an application. If the permit is denied, the BLM would be required to specify the reasons for its decision to deny the permit and to allow the applicant thereafter to address any issues.
The amendment would also address delays stemming from reviews under the Endangered Species Act and under the National Environmental Policy Act. Reviews under these statutes are required to be completed within 180 days to provide companies with certainty and to hold BLM accountable. If either of these deadlines is not met, the application would be deemed approved.
Significantly, there are currently 113 million acres of federal lands open and accessible for oil and gas development. Much of this federal land contains abundant domestic energy resources. In Utah alone, we have hundreds of acres available for drilling, acres that are currently being held up by bureaucratic delays. My amendment would ensure that Utah and other states in the west that are dominated by federal land can access the energy, the vast wealth that lies within their borders and provide the United States with a reliable source of domestic energy production.
Our energy security and our national security, more broadly, depends ultimately on our ability to produce energy. I understand that fuel prices right now are down relative to what they have been. We can't get too secure in this. We can't assume that it's always going to be this case. And certainly when the federal government insists on opening this much land, roughly one-third of the land in the United States as a whole, roughly two-thirds of the land in my state of Utah, if we're going to own this much land within the federal government, we really should be using the resources within it. We need to make sure that we're using that land to shore up our energy independence.
The less energy independent we become in this country, the more dependent we become on other countries that are producing energy, that are using their natural resources, countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and other countries where there are a lot of people growing wealthy off of our petro dollars and where many of those same people are using our own petro dollars to fund acts of terrorism against us.  Countries that are often hostile to our interests.
We need to do this because it makes sense economically and we need to do this because it makes sense from a national security standpoint as well. But in order for any of this to work, Mr. President, we have to have procedures in place to make sure that those people who choose to go out and want to develop land, want to develop federal land that's already been identified as suitable for oil and gas production within federal lands, that they have some modicum of due process, that they have some ability to predict what the procedural outcome is going to be, what set of procedures they'll have to follow and what kind of time line they will be facing as they approach this often lengthy process.
We do need to be careful. We do need to be sensitive and we need to make sure that we are developing our natural resources in a way that respects the environment and doesn't endanger our health or that of our federal lands. But this can be done in a way that doesn't have to result in open-ended and completely unforeseeable delays.
For this reason, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, amendment number 71, with the understanding that as they do so, they will be shoring up America’s energy independence and with it, America’s national security.

Title: Lee, McConnell Introduce Comp-Time Bill to Help Working Families
Date: January 22, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill to help workers handle the constant challenge of work-life balance by allowing all individuals who work overtime to choose between monetary compensation or comp-time. The “Working Family Flexibility Act” would free workers to choose the best way to alleviate the difficulties of juggling work, home, kids, and community.  Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama has introduced a companion bill in the House.
“For many families, especially with young children, their most precious commodity is time,” said Sen. Lee. “But today, federal labor laws restrict the way moms and dads and everyone else can use their time. For decades, Congress has given a special exemption from these laws to government employees. This is unacceptable. The same work-life options available to government employees should be available to private-sector workers, as well.”
“The Working Families Flexibility Act will help provide America’s workers with the flexible work arrangements they’ve told us they need. Countless Americans have become increasingly familiar with the same challenging reality: more and more to do, with less and less time to do it. And while Congress can’t legislate another hour in the day, we can help working Americans better balance the demands of work and family,” Senator McConnell said. “I appreciate the opportunity to join Senator Lee in pushing this commonsense proposal to provide private sector workers with compensatory time, which has been a priority of mine throughout my career, and I thank him for his continued work to promote measures important to working families.”
“I appreciate Senator McConnell’s leadership on this issue,” Lee added.  “He has been a strong advocate for middle-class families and reforms to improve the work-life balance for America’s moms and dads.”
The Senate version has 22 additional cosponsors, including Sens. Ayotte, Blunt, Cornyn, Murkowski, Vitter, Rubio, Burr, Barrasso, Isakson, Alexander, Crapo, Scott, Thune, Cruz, Wicker, Fischer, Risch, Daines, Capito, Toomey, Flake and Rounds.
More Information:
How It Works
Gives private-sector employers the ability to offer their employees the option of comp time or overtime pay, both accrued at 1½ times the overtime hours worked. Federal, State & local governments are currently allowed to offer comp time to their employees, but private-sector employers are banned from doing so by federal law.
Requires employers who decide to offer this option to their employees to establish a written agreement with the employee outlining the options and to allow each employee to voluntarily choose the option that best fits his needs.
Requires that comp time agreements be included in the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the union and the employer for any employee represented by a union.
Allows employees who choose to accrue comp time to accrue up to 160 hours each year.
Allows employees to “cash out” their accrued comp time at the traditional overtime pay rate at any time throughout the year.
Maintains all existing employee protections, including the current 40-hour workweek and overtime accrual, and provides additional safeguards to ensure that the choice to use comp time is voluntary.
Requires employers to pay employees at the traditional overtime rate for any unused comp time at the end of each calendar year.
What It Does
Ends the unfair discrimination against private-sector employees
Enables parents to better balance work and family obligations
Frees all workers to choose which commodity – time or money – is the more important resource at a given time
Lessens the burden of unnecessary federal regulation

Title: Lee: Build a New Agenda Around the Family
Date: January 13, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee gave remarks at a policy summit hosted by Heritage Action for America outlining many of the challenges American families face as a result of dysfunctional government policy.  He said too often Washington leaves behind hardworking families and that a new reform agenda should focus more on protecting the economic and social capital that married households provide.
Read the full speech
“The family has always been the linchpin of American life, but today more than ever the health of the family is indivisible from the destiny of our nation,” said Lee. But he lamented that “as American families approached the new economic challenges with their characteristic boldness and optimism, Washington responded with its characteristic lethargy and dysfunction.”
Lee outlined several major challenges that families face today – such as rising health care costs, the explosion in the price of higher education, and inefficient and ineffective transportation, labor, and housing systems – and pinned the dysfunction squarely on Washington’s inability to change the status quo.
“[T]hese are not stresses put on the family by the free market, or globalization, or income inequality, or even by corrosive trends in popular culture,” said Lee. “They are the product of sclerotic government policies that are imposed on the American people by politicians who respond to change by doubling down on status quo policies we already know don’t work.”
“This is not how a government
of
,
by
, and
for
the people is supposed to conduct itself. Our economy and society are constantly changing. The government’s job
isn’t
to micromanage or resist those changes, but to remove any barriers facing the American people as they adapt to them,” Lee explained
“As Lincoln wisely counseled, the ‘
leading object
’ of government should be to ‘
lift artificial weights
’ from all shoulders and “clear the paths of laudable pursuit’ for all – especially for the working moms and dads the status quo is leaving behind.”
Lee suggested several solutions to help improve economic opportunity and mobility for families, such as making higher education more affordable and accessible by allowing students to use federal loans for a wider variety of educational options.
“Non-traditional students who have been locked out of the current system – like working parents – deserve to be able to use federal student loans and grants to acquire the skills they need, at a price that’s right, and on a schedule that works for them,” he said.
Lee also argued that it’s time for policymakers to recognize that the family is both an economic unit as well as the “shaper of human character.”
“It is everyone’s primary source of human and social capital: skills and habits like empathy, self-control, and trust that facilitate our pursuit of happiness. By teaching us what it means to live with duties and obligations toward others, the family prepares us for citizenship and teaches us how to live as members of a community,” said Lee.
“We need to acknowledge that the family is both a moral institution with economic implications and an economic institution with moral implications.”

Title: Feinstein, Lee Introduce Due Process Guarantee Act
Date: January 7, 2015

Content:
Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act, a bill to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely, without charge or trial.
The legislation aims to end ongoing legal ambiguities by affirming and strengthening the principles behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971.
“Detaining U.S. citizens and green card holders indefinitely without charge or trial violates our fundamental values as a nation and represents a repetition of the horrific mistake made with the internment of Japanese-Americans” Feinstein said. “While some argue we need such detentions to stop violent extremists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Our criminal justice system has proven time and time again that it can successfully convict terrorism suspects within the bounds of law.”
“America should never waver in vigilantly pursuing those who would commit, or plot to commit, acts of treason against our country.  But the federal government should not be allowed to indefinitely imprison any American on the mere accusation of treason without affording them the due process guaranteed by our Constitution,” Lee said. “By forbidding the government from detaining Americans without trial absent explicit congressional approval, the Due Process Guarantee Act strikes the right balance between protecting our security and the civil liberties of each citizen.”
In recent years, some have argued that the indefinite detention of Americans is permissible under the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Due Process Guarantee Act clarifies that the AUMF and other general authorizations cannot be construed as acts of Congress that permit indefinite detention and codifies the “clear statement rule” to clarify that indefinite detention can only occur if Congress expressly authorizes it.
The bill also expands the Non-Detention Act of 1971 to include green card holders in addition to citizens.
In December 2012, the Senate passed this legislation as an amendment to the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act with 67 votes, but it stalled in the House of Representatives. This legislation is almost identical to that language.

Title: Lee to Introduce Balance Budget Amendment
Date: January 6, 2015

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the Constitution that would require the federal government to balance its budget each year.  The amendment would place strict limits on Washington’s ability to spend more money than it takes in, raise the debt limit, or increase taxes, and gives standing to any member of Congress to enforce the balanced budget requirement.
“Moms and dads, business owners, and state and local governments all over the country have to live within their means.  There is no good argument why Washington shouldn’t be expected to do the same each year,” said Lee, who sits on the Joint Economic Committee.  “Our national debt threatens our future prosperity and will force the country to make incredibly difficult decisions down the road if we don’t start making changes today.  My Balanced Budget Amendment puts effective limitations on Washington’s unsustainable appetite to overspend Americans’ hard-earned dollars without consequence.”
The proposed amendment, S. J. Res [XXX], requires Congress to spend no more than it takes in during any fiscal year and limits spending to 18% of the gross national product, the 40 year historical average of total federal receipts.  Congress can only run a deficit, raise taxes or increase the debt limit if agreed to by a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate.  The amendment gives standing to any member of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the balanced budget requirement as long as they have been authorized to do so by a petition signed by one-third of either the House or the Senate. The amendment would become effective in the second fiscal year after ratification.

Title: Lee: Our Executive Officials Must Uphold the Rule of Law
Date: December 16, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee made the following remarks regarding his opposition to the confirmation of Sarah Saldaña, President Obama’s nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“Mr./Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Sarah Saldaña to be in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the Department of Homeland Security.
“As we know, the President has recently announced that he will take unilateral executive action on immigration.  In so doing he has circumvented the democratic process, broken the law, and subverted the constitutional order.  It is incumbent on every member of this body — no matter what their politics, or what immigration policies they would prefer to enact — to oppose that usurpation of legislative power and to defend the rule of law.
“Fulfilling that duty leads me to oppose Ms. Saldaña’s nomination to be ICE director.  Although I respect her and her record of public service, including an admirable independent streak as United States Attorney, she has also demonstrated that her commitment to the rule of law may falter when it comes to faithfully enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act.  In response to a question asked by several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including me, Ms. Saldaña said she agreed with the position of DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson that immigrants who entered the country illegally, and have now been targeted for so-called deferred action, have “earned the right to be citizens.”
“That’s quite a bold claim.  No doubt Congress could, and many people think it should, ease the path the citizenship for some aliens here unlawfully.  But to assert that citizenship is a matter of right, and that it has been earned by the very act of breaking our immigration laws, is an unacceptable view for a person nominated to be head of immigration enforcement. …
“We have passed through the looking glass.  And to see how far we’ve gone inside, observe:  Today the President asks the Senate to install, as custodian of our border, a person who evidently believes that crossing our border illegally earns you the right to vote.  The Constitution gives the Senate the responsibility to give the President advice about his executive nominations, and ultimately its consent.  My advice is this:  The President should not proffer a nominee for the job of executing our immigration laws who affirmatively supports subverting them.  But that is exactly what he has done, so I cannot and will not give my consent.”

Title: Lee Introduces Regulatory Reform Bill
Date: December 11, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Lee introduced a bill that reforms our nation’s regulatory system by creating a regulatory budget process designed to measure, and set an upper limit on, the costs that federal rules and regulations impose on the economy each year. The “Regulatory Cost Assessment Act” brings transparency, accountability, and discipline to the system by requiring Congress to reclaim from the executive branch the responsibility for the effects and costs of regulations on the private sector.
“Reforming our federal regulatory regime is one of the greatest challenges facing our country today,” said Sen. Lee. “Each year thousands of rules and regulations, issued by the alphabet soup of federal agencies in Washington, D.C., cost our economy nearly $2 trillion. These costs are borne by businesses – large and small – trying to comply with all the red tape, but ultimately they’re passed on to the American people, in the form of lower take-home pay, fewer jobs, and higher costs of goods and services.”
“Right now, the main reason our regulatory system is so onerous and expensive,” Lee said, “is that regulations are issued by bureaucrats in the executive branch who will never be held to account for their decisions by the American people. This bill takes an important step toward solving that problem by making Congress directly accountable for the regulatory costs each federal agency can impose on the economy.”

Title: Lee Responds to President’s Statement on Net Neutrality
Date: November 10, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement in response the President’s announcement on net neutrality:
“The President’s suggestion that the FCC reclassify the Internet as a public utility, and subject it to the most pervasive and suffocating kind of government regulation, is dangerous. The Internet has flourished precisely because it has been open and free of just this kind of government control. The President’s policy would threaten to break the Internet—and stifle innovation in the most vibrant sector of our economy."
“To keep creating jobs and opportunities for the American people, the Internet needs to be free, and protected – by Congress if necessary - from another dysfunctional government takeover."
“Critics of the status quo are right to push for reform and it’s been almost twenty years since Congress updated The Communications Act. But net neutrality is a regulatory framework designed for railroads and telegraphs. We can’t condemn a regulatory framework from the 20th century to replace it with one from the 19th! What we need is to ensure we are protecting consumers and competition across this sector, putting neither producers nor providers, but consumers at the center of the Internet economy."
Senator Lee is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Title: How to Fix Congress:  Five Steps To Restore Trust, Transparency, And Empowerment
Date: November 6, 2014

Content:
After years of frustration and months of feverish work, the Republican Party has finally won back the U.S. Senate, and with it, undivided control of Congress. But no sooner had Tuesday night’s balloon drops hit the floor than Republicans around the country – and especially in certain offices in Washington, D.C. – faced that timeless question of election night winners: Now what?
This is never an easy question to answer, given the requisite balancing act between expectations and realities, politics and substance. And answering it could be especially difficult for the leaders of the new Republican Congress, for two additional reasons.
First, there is the still-strained relationship between the G.O.P.’s Washington establishment and its grassroots conservative base. And second, the party establishment and consultant class chose to de-emphasize Republican policy alternatives during the campaign. So despite that strategy’s apparent success Tuesday night, our new majority cannot claim a sweeping legislative mandate.
But this question needs to be answered, nonetheless. And soon.
As a frequent critic of my party’s strategic timidity - and as incoming Chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, whose job it is encourage bolder thinking and action - I thought it incumbent on me to offer some concrete, early, and hopefully constructive suggestions about how the new Republican Congress might be steered toward unity and success.
As the reader will see, the ideas below are not really policy goals. (I have my own ideas about what our party’s reform agenda ought to be, and I will spend most of the next two years advocating them.)
Rather, these are five suggestions to my Republican colleagues to help repair the dysfunctional legislative branch we have inherited, rebuild Congress’s reputation among the American people, and by extension slowly restore the public’s confidence in the Republican Party.
1. Rebuilding Trust
The greatest challenge to policymaking today is distrust. The American people distrust their government, and Congress in particular. For their part, Washington policymakers seem to distrust the people. And almost as pressing for the new majority, the distrust that now exists between grassroots conservative activists and elected Republican leaders can be particularly toxic.
Leaders can respond to this distrust in one of two ways. One option is the bare-knuckled partisanship that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has exhibited for the last eight years: twisting rules, blocking debate and amendments, and systematically disenfranchising hundreds of millions of Americans from political representation.
But this is no choice at all for the new Republican Majority. First, contempt for the American people and the democratic process is something Republicans should oppose in principle. Second, our new Senate majority will be both ideologically diverse and temperamentally independent – unlikely to be as docile and partisan as Senate Democrats have been. And finally, the 2016 presidential primary campaign may include several Republican Senators, whose incentives for differentiation in a crowded field will make internal politics even harder to predict or control.
No, the new Republican majority has neither the institutional credibility nor the cast of characters to expect backbenchers – let alone conservative activists and groups - to unquestioningly follow orders. Rather than resent or deny this fact, Republican leaders should embrace it. We should throw open the doors of Congress, and restore genuine representative democracy to the American republic.
No more “cliff” crises. No more secret negotiations. No more take-it-or-leave-it deadline deals. No more passing bills without reading them. No more procedural manipulation to block debate and compromise. These are the abuses that have created today’s status quo – the status quo Republicans have been hired to correct.
What too few in Washington appreciate – and what the new Republican Congress must if we hope to succeed – is that the American people’s current distrust of their public institutions is totally justified. There’s no misunderstanding. Americans are fed up with Washington, and they have every right to be. The exploitative status quo in Washington has corrupted Americans’ economy and their government, and made its entrenched defenders rich in the process.
This situation was created by both parties, but repairing it is now going to fall to the Republican Party. It’s our job to win back the public’s trust. And that can’t be done simply by passing more bills, or even better bills. The only way to gain trust is to be trustworthy. I think that means we have to invite the people back into the process, to give the bills we do pass the moral legitimacy Congress alone no longer confers.
This openness should probably extend beyond the formal legislative process to the strategy­ development process, too. Congressional majorities too often approach their work on an ad hoc basis, bobbing like a cork in a creek between reactive opportunism and institutional inertia. But as we have seen in recent years, the leadership vacuums that kind of passivity creates never stay unfilled.
Whatever one might think of their relative merits, recent strategic initiatives led by congressional back-benchers - the “Cut, Cap, Balance” budget plan in 2011, the filibuster letter on gun control in early 2013, the effort to defund Obamacare last fall, and to an extent, even the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill – all represented efforts to fill vacuums created by Republican leaders’ reticence and inaction.
Rather than resist this new reality, the new Republican majority can use it to our advantage.
Republican leaders should embrace a more open-source strategy development model that includes everyone on the front end to avoid confusion, suspicion, and division on the back end. The last four years have repeatedly shown the folly of excluding anti-establishment conservatives from strategy formation – bills pulled from the floor, intra-Conference chaos, back-biting in the press.
Now, with the minority Democrats desperate to highlight such episodes, Republican leaders have every reason to get out in front of every issue, every major bill, every project, and get everyone on board before the train leaves the station.
An excellent example of this kind of approach is that of Sen. Lamar Alexander, likely incoming chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Sen. Alexander has made no secret of wanting to do a major reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act. He and his staff have quietly sounded out various higher-ed reform ideas for over a year already. That’s a model all Republican decision-makers should be following, starting immediately.
Inclusive legislative and strategy processes will come with tradeoffs, of course. Leaders will have to surrender some of their institutional power. Conservatives will have to be prepared to accept defeat – fair and square - if our ideas cannot carry the day. Members will have to expose themselves to inconvenient amendment votes. The results of some votes and the fates of certain bills may prove unpredictable. But the costs of an open-source, transparent process are worth it for the benefits of greater inclusion of more diverse voices and views, and for the opportunity such a process would offer to rebuild the internal and external trust necessary to govern.
2. Don’t Forget Cronyism
We’re going to be hearing that word, “govern,” a lot in coming weeks, as in, “Now Republicans must show they can govern.” What is meant by this is passing bills - quickly and with bipartisan support - and having them signed into law, in order to show the country that Republicans can “get things done.”
In this advice, there is much truth, and also a trap.
The truth is that, yes, Republicans should take every opportunity to reform federal law wherever common ground with Democrats can be found. And if good policy makes for good politics, as it usually does, so much the better.
But the trap is that Republicans in fact can’t “govern” from the House and Senate alone — especially without a Senate supermajority. We can clearly articulate our views and advance our ideas, and then see where we can work with the president and congressional Democrats. But we have to do these things in that order. We should find common ground that advances our agenda, rather than let the idea of common ground substitute for our agenda.
If we fail to grasp that, we will be drawn into advancing legislation that is both substantively and politically counterproductive, and that sends the wrong message to the public about our party. For instance, the easiest bipartisan measures to pass are almost always bills that directly benefit Big Business, and thus appeal to the corporatist establishments of both parties. In 2015, this “low-hanging fruit” we’ll hear about will be items like corporate tax reform, Obamacare’s medical device tax, patent reform, and perhaps the Keystone XL pipeline approval.
As it happens, these are all good ideas that I support. But if that’s as far as Republicans go, we will regret it. The GOP’s biggest branding problem is that Americans think we’re the party of Big Business and The Rich. If our “Show-We-Can-Govern” agenda can be fairly attacked as giving Big Business what it wants – while the rest of the country suffers – we will only reinforce that unpopular image.
Insofar as the pent-up K Street agenda includes good ideas, then by all means let’s pass those pieces by huge margins and send them to the president. But a new Republican majority must also make clear that our support for free enterprise cuts both ways – we’re pro-market, not simply pro-business. To prove that point, we must target the crony capitalist policies that rig our economy for large corporations and special interests at the expense of everyone else – especially small and new businesses.
In other words, Republicans should seek common ground between conservative principles and the interests and needs of the general public, not just between Washington Republicans and Washington Democrats. And the search for that genuinely common ground will point to a lot of low-hanging fruit too, even when it comes to the proper relationship between government and business. We could pass legislation winding down the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. We could – and really, must - eliminate the taxpayer bailouts for big insurance companies in Obamacare’s “risk corridors” program.
Or we could start to break up taxpayer subsidies for the energy industry or large agribusinesses.
Anti-cronyism legislation is win-win for the G.O.P. It is good policy, restoring growth and fairness to an economy that Big Government and Big Business have rigged against the little guy. And it’s even better politics, standing up for the middle class while pinning hypocritical Democrats between their egalitarian talking points and their elitist agenda.
Taking on crony capitalism is a test of the political will and wisdom of the G.O.P. To become the party of the middle class and those aspiring to join it – our only hope for success in 2016 and beyond - we have to change more than our rhetoric. The new Republican Congress does have to get things done, but those things have to be for Main Street, too, not just Wall Street and K Street. A big part of our “governing” test is whether we can stand up to special interests. Leaders like Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling in the House, and Marco Rubio and Jeff Sessions in the Senate have made the fight against cronyism a point of emphasis – and it’s sure to be a theme in the 2016 presidential primaries, too
This issue is reaching critical mass on the Right. And as I see it, it’s now a political necessity, another one that we should embrace rather than resist.
In passing anti-cronyism bills, we can either achieve policy wins for economic growth and opportunity. Or we can let the president explain in his veto messages why taxpayers, whose take-home pay is stagnant, should be subsidizing corporations, whose profits have never been higher. That’s a brand-changing debate Republicans can win.
3. Keep it Simple on the Budget
The biggest strategic and legislative question the new Republican Congress will face in 2015 is what we should do on the Budget.
The procedural and political realities of the Budget process demand that, in an era of divided government, it highlight the contrasts between the two parties. (Unless, like the Democrats, you ignore federal law and just don’t do a Budget at all, the better to conceal your true beliefs from the public.)
Come the spring, House and Senate Republicans have to pass a common Budget Resolution for the fiscal year starting next fall. The Budget’s privileged process allows for its passage in the Senate with only 51 votes – which in all likelihood will mean 51 (hopefully 54!) Republicans and no Democrats. This step must be fulfilled to begin the so-called reconciliation process, under which Congress can fast-track a single fiscal reform bill later on – again with only 51 Senate votes.
It’s such a complicated process, and such a delicate political balancing act that to succeed, the Republican establishment and conservative grassroots should come to an agreement very early on the broad parameters of what the Budget must entail.
Arguing over specific spending levels, cuts, programs, and reforms at this point is probably unwise. Rather, we should try to agree on a handful of principles that all Republicans can agree on and not try to have the budget alone substitute for everything Congress needs to do.
The three most obvious Republican consensus principles – to me, anyway - are that our budget should:
1. Balance within ten years (without accounting gimmicks),
2. Not raise taxes, and
3. Repeal Obamacare.
These goals comprise the closest thing our party has to a mandate in the wake of this election, and my guess is that every House and Senate Republican is already on record supporting them.
If we want to avoid an ugly establishment-grassroots battle next spring, Republican leaders and Budget Committee leaders would do well to reach out to all wings of the party to get buy-in on a framework like this, and only then begin the sausage-making.
There are rumors around Capitol Hill that some Republicans don’t want to repeal Obamacare in the budget process. They would prefer to pursue something else – corporate tax reform, for instance – where bipartisan cooperation may be more attainable. They want to use budget reconciliation to “get a win.”
But this has things backwards, it seems to me. President Obama and many Democrats have already voiced some support for corporate tax reform. Any plan that could get the president’s signature wouldn’t need to be done via reconciliation, because such a bipartisan compromise could easily get 60 votes in the Senate. The whole point of reconciliation is that it allows the majority one chance to pass something with only simple majorities. For Republicans in 2015 – not as a matter of ideological purity but of practical coalitional unity - that one thing has to include repealing Obamacare. Corporate tax reform – and much else – can be pursued in other ways.
4. Fund It? Fix it.
One of the biggest traps Republicans and conservatives fall into is any debate about budget “cuts.” When you stop for a moment and think, blindly “cutting” the federal government’s budget is not a very conservative approach to governing. After all, the conservative critique of Washington is not that the federal government is a bit profligate, but otherwise efficient and effective with our money. No, the problem with Washington is that it’s comprehensively wasteful, unfair, and dysfunctional. It is, in a great many areas of policy, trying to do the wrong things and doing them in the wrong ways.
Just spending less on a misguided program doesn’t get you any closer to a real solution than just spending more on it. If the program is dysfunctional – if it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do, and what it’s supposed to do is worth doing – fix it. Fixing a leaky faucet is not an arbitrary “cut” in one’s water bill – it’s repairing a broken system so that it only costs what it must.
Republicans can approach federal reform the same way. We can make a commitment in coming years not merely to cut big government, but to fix broken government, which is the more difficult but far more important work.
For instance, we know for a fact that the federal highway trust fund wastes money: on bureaucracy, on special interest giveaways, on projects that are purely local and can be managed by state and municipal governments. Therefore, when the time comes next spring to reauthorize the federal highway program, the Republican Congress should insist on making the system at least a little bit better – rather than just “finding the money” to fully fund a legacy system we already know doesn’t work.
I along with several other conservatives have proposed a plan to permanently reform the highway program; I also know that President Obama is unlikely to sign it. Republicans shouldn’t accept the president’s veto threat as the end of the negotiation, however, but the beginning. If he wants infrastructure money, he should accept some structural reforms to give states more flexibility and let gas tax revenue go further.
Similarly, Head Start is a program that the Obama Administration itself has found does not work. Decades of rigorous analysis have shown that it does not yield lasting benefits for children in need. So, rather than spend less money on exactly the same broken system – and merely disserve fewer poor children - Republicans should start to fix it – to better serve more children, at lower cost to the taxpayers.
Sen. Tom Coburn has fought for years to clean up wasteful aspects of the Defense Department budget that have no bearing on national security. Sen. Dick Durbin and I have introduced a bill to reform federal criminal sentencing guidelines, which would save taxpayers $2.5 billion over ten years.
Crumbling public support of Common Core should force action on federal K-12 grants. The Ebola outbreak demands serious reprioritization at the Centers for Disease Control.
The annual appropriations process should take up this approach, too. We should put an end to “omnibus,” all-or-nothing spending packages, and instead insist on consideration of each appropriations bill in regular order – with hearings, amendments, and specific votes. This is how the Constitution protects Americans from waste and exploitation, after all. It’s also the only way Congress can hope to rein in the Obama Administration’s unprecedented abuses of power – by withholding funding from corrupt bureaucracies.
Indeed, the entire congressional budget-and-spending process is due for a comprehensive overhaul. But at a minimum, Congress should only fund reformed programs. (Only in D.C. would this suggestion be even remotely controversial.) If the president rigidly resists intelligent, surgical reform based on thorough oversight, then we could turn to across-the-board cuts, as we did in 2011.
These are not heavy lifts or ideological crusades I’m describing. They only seem novel because it’s been so long since we’ve had a functioning legislature. My modest proposal is that if there is a good reason for Congress to fund a program, that in and of itself is a good reason to continually improve it.
5. Ryan-ize the Committees
Ironically (or not, if you know how Congress works), the most important policy development in the Republican Party in the last decade was not undertaken by party leaders in the House, Senate, or the White House. In fact, formal party leaders largely discouraged it.
Instead, that work was conducted by Congressman Paul Ryan when he became the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee in 2007. Ryan instructed his new committee staff to think big, to transcend the short-termism that plagues Congress and develop solutions to long-term problems. Ryan and his staff dove deep into America’s structural budget shortfalls and the long-term challenges to our entitlement programs and economy.
The end result was what Ryan called his “Roadmap for America’s Future.” It called for major reforms to our tax system, our entitlement programs, our health care system, and across the federal government. It was controversial, of course. The immediate reception was predictable: Democrats trashed it and most Republicans ran for cover. But in time, people on both sides of the aisle were forced to admit that the Roadmap was a serious document. It warranted a serious debate, and it has gotten one ever since. When Republicans took back the House of Representatives in 2011, some of the broad outlines of the Ryan Roadmap became de facto positions of the Republican party – positions on issues Democrats still try to pretend don’t exist.
For all the well-deserved plaudits Ryan gets for his brains, the Roadmap – whatever one thinks of it - was really an achievement of his guts. He had the courage to take his plan into the arena, and withstand criticism, even from his allies. That is, he did what all politicians say we want to do – and succeeded.
So the fifth step to a healthy Republican majority in the 114th Congress is to use congressional committees to begin developing the agenda for the 115th and 116th and 117th Congresses, too. We should “Ryan-ize” the committees, for lack of a better word, encouraging our chairmen to think big. House and Senate Republicans should make it part of the job description of “Chairman” that each committee – and ideally, each subcommittee – propose at least one major, fundamental, long-term policy overhaul each year.
These reforms could not be passed in this Congress, of course. And conservatives are rightly suspicious of “big bill” legislating at all anymore. But such proposals would serve the valuable purpose of identifying long-term goals that nearer-term, incremental proposals can move policy toward. They would be outlines, not thousand-page bills, and they would help shape the small bills and gradual steps necessary to advance a conservative vision of government.
America’s health care, energy, higher education, telecommunications, security, and criminal justice needs (to name just a few) appear to be in the midst of transitions, nearing tipping points that will help define our nation in decades to come. In such a moment, it’s not enough to ask ourselves, “What can we pass this year?” without first asking – and investing every possible resource into answering – “How can our needs be met in the 21st century?”
Government itself is one of the prime candidates for this kind of thinking. Most systems we use to provide government services were designed decades ago, before the tech and telecom revolutions that have changed the way Americans do almost everything else. In twenty years, will we need, say, a Government Printing Office or Internal Revenue Service in anything like their current forms? If disruptive innovations continue to personalize and localize the economy, will centralized, monolithic bureaucracies be the right instruments to regulate it? Or is government just as badly in need of some disruptive innovations that would enable market forces, public desires, and longstanding constitutional principles to once again show us the way and make our institutions more accountable?
Of course politicians cannot predict the future, nor can government direct future industries any better than it directs current ones. But we know that our society and our economy have rocketed out in front of our government, and that the bureaucracy in its current form is unlikely ever to catch up. Insisting that today’s leaders look beyond the next news cycle and the next election cycle will benefit the country and the Republican Party in the long run.
The only way to move incrementally in the right direction is to know which way the right direction is. Long-term reform projects will lay down markers for the Party while identifying opportunities for innovation in the nearer term.
The above suggestions represent dramatic departures from Congress’s status quo, but that’s the point. The new Republican majority cannot indulge in fantasies of a mandate or public contentment with its political institution.
Everything about American life today is becoming more decentralized, open-source, localized and personalized. Everything, that is, except government. An increasingly customizable economy and diverse social networks of mini-communities will not long tolerate the innate incompetence of clumsy, self-serving, Big Government. Since the end of the Cold War, the American people have experimented with every conceivable combination of partisan control in Washington – presidents, Houses, and Senates of both parties.
In that time, the costs of the staples of middle-class life – housing, health care, education, child-rearing, and retirement security – have risen, unabated. Yet take-home pay is stagnant and jobs are increasingly insecure. We are not getting this right.
But the cliché that Washington doesn’t work is not right, either. Washington does work, for Washington. For many years, Congress has worked perfectly well for so-called “stakeholders” on Wall Street, K Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue. The challenge for the new Republican majority is to put Congress back to work for Main Street — to make Washington work for America.
The status quo is failing. So leaders need to seek for strategies and tactics outside the status quo. The new Republican Congress cannot be led according to the old ways of hierarchical deference, or appeals to institutional trust.
But just because Republican unity cannot be imposed doesn’t mean it cannot be achieved. There are other paths to unity and cooperation and shared success, including the path that the Republican Party already embraces in America’s free enterprise economy and voluntary civil society.
What I propose, then, is an agenda of empowerment – an internal Republican agenda of empowerment to complement our external one. Let Congress operate less like a 19th-century industrial mill, and more like a 21st-century open-source network.
The media wants to criticize the G.O.P.’s diversity and independence as disunity and weakness. But this criticism says much more about the critics than about us. It’s like saying in 1999 that Borders Books would rout Amazon, or saying today that taxi cartels are “stronger” than Uber. In today’s world, individual and community empowerment are strengths for organizations who know how to use them.
Transparency, equality, diversity, and innovation – these are not abstract values, but practical strategies that our new majority can use to unite the Republican coalition, revive public trust in Congress, and put the federal government back on the side of the working families and communities our broken status quo is leaving behind.
Tuesday, Republicans won a great victory.
Now what? Deserve it.

Title: Lee Responds to Court Decision on Gay Marriage Cases
Date: October 6, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to the decision by the Supreme Court to not review several cases involving a state’s right to define marriage:
“The Supreme Court’s decision to not review the Tenth Circuit’s ruling in Kitchen v. Herbert is disappointing.  Nothing in the Constitution forbids a state from retaining the traditional definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.  Whether to change that definition is a decision best left to the people of each state — not to unelected, politically unaccountable judges. The Supreme Court owes it to the people of those states, whose democratic choices are being invalidated, to review the question soon and reaffirm that states do have that right.”

Title: Lee Responds to Chairman Priebus’ Remarks on a GOP Agenda
Date: October 2, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Following Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus’ speech at George Washington University entitled “Principles for an American Renewal,” Senator Mike Lee released the following response:
LEE: “Chairman Priebus has laid out the case for how Republicans should succeed this fall.  We have a broad agenda to address Americans’ economic and national security concerns, while the Democrats are forced to run on their failed record of Obamacare, unemployment, and debt.  The choice couldn’t be more clear and it’s up to the American people to decide the course we take.
“Chairman Priebus succinctly expressed Republican core principles and values, and presented numerous examples of solutions Republicans have produced by applying those principles to the challenges facing working families today.  We have proposals to increase economic security among the middle class, improve mobility for working-class families, and ensure the system is no longer rigged for those at the top.
“It is an ambitious vision for the future of our country and demonstrates the kind of leadership Americans are desperate for.  I am encouraged that the GOP is the party of ideas once again.”

Title: Lee to Speak at Sutherland on Anti-Poverty Agenda
Date: October 1, 2014

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Senator Mike Lee will speak this evening at an event sponsored by The Sutherland Institute to discuss efforts to reform federal anti-poverty programs to increase economic security among the middle class and improve mobility for working-class families.
When:              Wednesday, October 1, 7:00 pm MT
Where:             La Jolla Groves
190 S 400 W
Salt Lake City
This event is open to the press.
Please RSVP to Dave Buer,
dbuer@sutherlandinstitute.org
The following are excerpts from tonight’s speech:
“Despite trillions of taxpayer dollars spent to eradicate poverty since the late 1960s, the poverty rate across the country has hardly budged. And nearly every strategy we have employed in this “war” – dealing with everything from health care to criminal justice – has failed to achieve genuine change in our most vulnerable communities.”
…
“Defenders of today’s status quo say that any critique of our welfare system is really just a thinly-veiled attempt to destroy the social safety net. But what we all
should
want – and what
I certainly do want
– is not to destroy the safety net, but to
make it work.”
…
“Then, as now, people were not isolated because they were poor – they were poor mostly because they were isolated. And however unintended, too many government programs today only
exacerbate
that isolation. Networks of opportunity formed within the free market and civil society are not
threats
that poor families need more
protection from
. They are
blessings
that poor families need more
access to
.”
…
“Properly considered, then, the war on poverty is not so much about lifting people up. It’s about
bringing people in
. And so the challenge to us today is to rethink the war on poverty along these lines... to bring into our economy and society the individuals, families, and communities that have for five decades been unfairly locked out.”
…
“Whether it’s empowering lower-income Americans with better health care options, or giving parents the power to choose where they send their children to school, many of our solutions to poverty will follow a similar pattern: we need to replace our unresponsive systems centralized in the Washington bureaucracy with bottom-up solutions that empower the people closest to the problems to find solutions that work best for them. For this, Utah offers a great model for the rest of the country.”

Title: RELEASE: Lee & Durbin: According to CBO, Smarter Sentencing Bill Would Reduce Prison Costs by More Than $4 Billion
Date: September 15, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) announced today that their bill to modernize nonviolent drug sentencing policies would reduce prison costs in America by $4.36 billion over 10 years, according to a new report compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
CBO is the second government agency to conclude that the Durbin-Lee bill would produce billions of dollars in savings.  The Department of Justice, which administers our federal prison system, has estimated that the bill would avoid prison costs of nearly $7.4 billion in 10 years and $24 billion in 20 years.
With federal prison populations skyrocketing and approximately half of the nation’s federal inmates serving sentences for drug offenses, the Smarter Sentencing Act would give federal judges more discretion in sentencing those convicted of non-violent drug offenses.
“Today’s CBO report proves that not only are mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses often unfair, they are also fiscally irresponsible,” said Durbin.  “By making the incremental, targeted changes that Senator Lee and I have proposed in our Smarter Sentencing Act, we can save taxpayers billions without jeopardizing public safety.  In fact, these aren’t just savings going back to the treasury – this is money that will be invested in law enforcement and crime prevention activities that will make our communities safer.”
“Today’s CBO report is great news,” Lee said.  “It confirms that making smart reforms to our drug sentencing laws will save the taxpayers billions of dollars.  The targeted changes that Senator Durbin and I have proposed to our harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws will strengthen our country by reuniting nonviolent drug offenders who have paid their debt to society more quickly with their families, and the CBO report shows that doing so will cost us less in the long run.”
The United States has seen a 500% increase in the number of inmates in federal custody over the last 30 years, in large part due to the increasing number and length of certain federal mandatory sentences. Mandatory sentences, particularly drug sentences, can force a judge to impose a one-size-fits-all sentence without taking into account the details of an individual case. Many of these sentences have disproportionately affected minority populations and helped foster deep distrust of the criminal justice system.
This large increase in prison populations has also put a strain on our prison infrastructure and federal budgets. The Bureau of Prisons is more than 30% over capacity and this severe overcrowding puts inmates and guards at risk. There is more than 50% overcrowding at high-security facilities. This focus on incarceration is also diverting increasingly limited funds from law enforcement and crime prevention to housing inmates. It currently costs nearly $30,000 to house just one federal inmate for a year. There are currently about 214,000 inmates in federal custody, approximately half of them serving sentences for drug offenses.
The bipartisan Durbin-Lee bill is an incremental approach that does not abolish any mandatory sentences. Rather, it takes a studied and modest step in modernizing drug sentencing policy by:
Modestly expanding the existing federal “safety valve”
: Our legislative “safety valve” has been effective in allowing federal judges to appropriately sentence certain non-violent drug offenders below existing mandatory minimums. This safety valve, however, only applies to a narrow subset of cases. The Smarter Sentencing Act would modestly broaden criteria for eligibility. This change, which only applies to certain non-violent drug offenses, is supported by nearly 70% of federal district court judges.
Promoting sentencing consistent with the bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act
: The bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 – which was authored by Senator Durbin and unanimously passed the Senate before it was signed into law – reduced a decades-long sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Unfortunately, because of the timing of their sentences, some individuals are still serving far-too-lengthy sentences that Congress has already determined are unjust and racially disparate. The Smarter Sentencing Act allows certain inmates sentenced under the pre-Fair Sentencing Act sentencing regime to petition for sentence reductions consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act and current law. Federal courts successfully and efficiently conducted similar crack-related sentence reductions after 2007 and 2011 changes to the Sentencing Guidelines. More information on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 can be found here.
Increasing individualized review for certain drug sentences
: The Smarter Sentencing Act lowers certain drug mandatory minimums, allowing judges to determine, based on individual circumstances, when the harshest penalties should apply. The Act does not repeal any mandatory minimum sentences and does not lower the maximum sentences for these offenses. This approach keeps intact a floor at which all offenders with the same drug-related offense will be held accountable but reserves the option to dole out the harshest penalties where circumstances warrant. These changes do not apply to penalties for violent offenses.
The bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act is supported by faith leaders from the National Association of Evangelicals to the United Methodist Church. It is supported by groups and individuals including Heritage Action, Justice Fellowship of Prison Fellowship Ministries, Major Cities Chiefs Association, the ACLU, Grover Norquist, International Union of Police Associations, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 100 former prosecutors and judges, the NAACP, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, the Sentencing Project, American Conservative Union, Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), the Council of Prison Locals, Ralph Reed, Open Society Policy Center, American Correctional Association, the American Bar Association, National Black Prosecutors Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Texas Public Policy Foundation, and the Constitution Project.

Title: Lee at Reagan Ranch: Answering Reagan's Challenge
Date: August 13, 2014

Content:
RANCHO DEL CIELO - Today, Senator Mike Lee delivered a speech at the Reagan Ranch to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of President Reagan signing into law one of his first major economic reforms, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.
In the speech, Lee argued that while Reagan’s legacy may be best remembered by what he accomplished in office, such as passing the Recovery Act, it was in the years prior to becoming president where Regan built the foundation for his future policy successes.
The following excerpts are from the speech:
Reagan wanted to build a new Republican Party, a new majority coalition, a new conservative movement that would not just cut across party lines... but permanently redraw them.
He knew that abstract theories and negative attacks weren’t going to cut it. Reagan needed to make conservatism new, real, and relevant.
He rebuilt conservatism with a concrete agenda of innovative reforms to directly help and empower all of the forgotten Americans whom liberalism always leaves behind.
A real conservative reform agenda has to do more than just cut big government. It has to fix broken government. Reagan did just that a generation ago. Since then, new challenges have emerged, demanding repair – and conservative principles can once again point us toward exciting, innovative solutions.
His agenda was designed to give ordinary Americans even more power to make those decisions. He respected them and trusted them, and thought the government should simply get out of the way.  He knew the answer was not to get America to trust Washington; it was to get Washington to trust America.

Title: Lee: A Better Way to Improve America's Transportation Infrastructure
Date: July 29, 2014

Content:
“Under the Transportation Empowerment Act, Americans could finally enjoy the local infrastructure they want. More environmentally conscious states and towns could finally have the flexibility to invest in more green transit projects and bike lanes. Regions reaping the benefits of America’s energy renaissance could accelerate their infrastructure build-outs to keep up with their explosive growth. Dense cities could invest in more sustainable public transit networks.
“Meanwhile, surrounding counties could re-open the frontiers of the suburbs to a new generation of more livable communities. State and local governments will also be freed to experiment with innovative funding mechanisms not tied to the unreliable gas tax.  And by cutting out the Washington middle-men, all those states and communities and taxpayers will be able to get more for less…
“Today Americans are unnecessarily stuck in traffic, stuffed in overcrowded subway cars, missing their kids’ games and recitals, priced out of neighborhoods close to their jobs and spend almost a full 40-hour work week per year stuck in gridlock.
“They deserve better than what Washington is offering, which is just the status quo plus a little more money.  A new era demands a new approach.”

Title: Senate to Vote on Lee's Transportation Reform
Date: July 23, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, the full Senate agreed to include Senator Mike Lee’s proposal to reform transportation funding in a package of amendments on the Highway Trust Fund. The “
Transportation Empowerment Act
” would allow states to keep the vast majority of revenue each raises through the gas tax, making it easier and more effective for communities to develop the transportation system they want and need.
“Nearly half the states are already taking steps to become more fiscally independent in how they fund transportation projects,” said Sen. Lee. “This legislation would make that process easier and empower all 50 states to be more responsive to the needs of their citizens.  The states already own and maintain the roads.  There is no good reason why they should have to send their citizen’s infrastructure money to Washington first.”
The Transportation Empowerment Act phases down the federal gas tax over five years from 18.4 cents per gallon to 3.7 cents and transfers highway authority from the federal government to the states.
“Under this new system, Americans would no longer have to send significant gas-tax revenue to Washington, where politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists take their cut before sending it back with strings attached,” Lee added.  “Instead, states and cities could plan, finance, and build smarter and more affordable projects.”
Lee’s plan would ignite a new era of infrastructure innovation and diversity. Some communities could choose to build more roads, while others might prefer to repair old ones. Some might build highways, others light-rail. And all would be free to experiment with innovative green technologies, and new ways to finance their projects, like congestion pricing and smart tolls. For the country as a whole, this plan would mean a better infrastructure system, new jobs and opportunities, diverse localism, and innovative environmental protection.
“Americans know we need more roads, bridges, lanes, and mass-transit systems. My plan will not only allow local communities to develop infrastructure projects according to their own needs and values, but will allow their dollars to go further by cutting out the political middle-men in Washington. Properly planned and located, these projects would help create new jobs, new communities, more affordable homes, shorter commuting times, and greater opportunity for businesses and families,” said Lee.
Lee’s stand-alone bill (S.1702) has been cosponsored by Senators Rubio, Cruz, Roberts, and Johnson, while a House companion (HR3486) introduced by Rep. Tom Graves has 49 cosponsors.

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Reduce Costs of Federal Infrastructure Projects
Date: July 17, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a bill that would drive down the inflated costs of federally funded construction projects on our nation’s infrastructure and makes it easier for federal contractors to train and employ workers of all skill levels. The “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” would also save the American people billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer money and diminishe the power of the cronyist alliance between big government and big labor unions.
“The Davis-Bacon Act exemplifies how big government hurts the people it purports to help, gives unfair advantages to favored special interests, and squeezes the middle class,” said Sen. Lee. “It crowds out low-skilled workers in the construction industry, preventing them from getting a fair shot at a job, and funnels taxpayer money to prop up big labor unions, which accrue windfall profits as Davis-Bacon removes the incentive for federal contractors to hire unskilled, non-unionized workers.”
Forcing the American citizens to subsidize labor unions in this way artifically inflates the costs of construction projects to repair and improve our national infrastructure. This is unfair, and unsustainable, and costing taxpayers billions of dollars every year. Senator Lee’s “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” removes these government-imposed obstacles to economic opportunity facing low-skilled workers and returns wasted taxpayer dollars back into the hands of the American people.  Senator Lee will offer the bill as an amendment to legislation that addresses the funding of our nation's highway and transportation systems.
Joining Senator Lee in support of the “Davis-Bacon Repeal Act” are nine original cosponsors: Sens. Alexander (TN), Cruz (TX), Scott (SC), Sessions (AL), Coburn (OK), Johnson (WI), Cornyn (TX), Rubio (FL), and Vitter (LA).

"Today's decision in Burwell v Hobby Lobby marks an important victory for religious liberty. Americans do not shed their religious freedoms merely by going into business.  The Court's ruling upholds and strengthens the rights of individuals and the rule of law, while protecting the Constitution."

Title: Lee Reacts to Supreme Court's Recess Appointments Decision
Date: June 26, 2014

Content:
On January 3, 2012 the President ignored the Constitution and attempted to circumvent the Senate by unilaterally making important appointments to controversial executive agencies. Although past presidents have made recess appointments, the appointments President Obama attempted to make were different. The President attempted to change the Senate’s rules and define for himself when the Senate is in session and when it is in recess.  The Supreme Court’s decision today—in which all nine justices, including President Obama’s own nominees, held that President Obama violated the Constitution—makes plain that the President’s actions were truly unprecedented and unauthorized.
Regardless of whether the President is a Democrat or a Republican, Members of Congress have a duty to support the Constitution and defend the Senate’s prerogatives. That is why I took measures to oppose President Obama’s unconstitutional recess appointments, including speaking out against these appointments at every opportunity and opposing the President’s nominees until the Senate imposed the Leahy-Thurmond rule in the summer of 2012.

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced his plans to offer an amendment that would block funding for a regulation that allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to dictate local zoning requirements in any community across the country.
“Even for our highly centralized federal government, this rule represents an extreme step in consolidating government decisions over distinctly local matters within the hands of distant, unaccountable bureaucrats,” said Lee. “Local authorities are far more attuned to the unique conditions and needs of their communities, and they have a personal stake in their success. In every state across the country, there is no doubt that a mayor and city council officials will be more personally invested and more effective in improving the lives of the people in their community than a federal official located in Washington, D.C.”
Senator Lee plans to offer his amendment to the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act should it be brought to the floor this week.
If funded, the “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” rule would empower federal officials to assert the authority to force any community that receives a Community Development Block Grant to comply with zoning plans written in Washington.  This rule effectively allows HUD to carve up the country, block by block, according to its own priorities and preferences.
Community Development Block Grants are allocations of federal tax dollars, issued to local governments by HUD, to address a variety of community development needs. One of the primary uses of these resources is to provide affordable public housing for individuals and families in need. Sadly, the inevitable consequence of federal management over how local officials spend this money will only make it harder for communities to provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need.
To protect the ability of local officials to serve low-income communities, Senator Lee’s amendment would prevent this egregious power grab by the federal government and would keep housing decisions closest to the people who are affected by them.
Rep. Paul Gosar is the original sponsor of a similar amendment in the House, which was successfully added to H.R. 4745, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015.

Title: Lee Urges Senate to Address the Threat of Western Wild Fires
Date: June 11, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee sent a letter to Senator Mary Landrieu, Chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, urging the Committee to promptly schedule oversight hearings to review federal wildland fire management activities and address the threat of catastrophic wildland fire in the West. Senator Lee expressed grave concerns about the ability of the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to protect public safety during what is projected to be a severe and destructive wildfire season.
Along with five other Senators who signed the letter, Senator Lee explained, “One of the greatest challenges facing our western forests is the growing severity of the fire season.  Extreme fire behavior has become the new normal, due in no small part, to the mismanagement or lack of management of our public lands.  This mismanagement has resulted in the loss of property, natural resources, wildlife habitat, as well as jobs and economic opportunities in rural communities.”
The Senators urged the Committee to follow the lead of the House of Representatives, which has “already approved legislation to restore active forest management,” and act quickly on this urgent matter. “Given that this fire season is off to an early and destructive start, it is critical that the Committee hear from the land-management agencies and examine and evaluate the agencies’ capacity to respond appropriately to wildfires, reduce fire risk to communities, and improve forest, watershed, and rangeland health.”
These oversight hearings represent the crucial first step in advancing “national forestry, rangeland, and watershed management reforms that will reduce wildland fire risks through more active management.”

Title: Lee Attends SASC Briefing on Bergdahl
Date: June 10, 2014

Content:
Senator Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), attended a meeting of SASC members this morning to receive a classified briefing from senior Pentagon officials on the prisoner exchange of five high-level Taliban leaders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
The transfer of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay violated federal law requiring the Department of Defense to notify Congress 30 days prior to the transfer of any detainees from that facility.  Following the briefing, Senator Lee remained concerned that the administration did not fully recognize the security implications of transferring these detainees and allowing them to eventually return to Afghanistan.
Said Senator Lee, "These five detainees were important leaders of the former Taliban government and had previously been deemed too dangerous to transfer, as recently as 2010.  We still have serious questions about why suddenly they were no longer dangerous, and whether their return to Afghanistan could result in undermining over a decade of American work in that country that cost the lives of thousands of our service members."
Senator Lee will continue to push for answers to these questions and ensure that these decisions are being made more responsibly and with greater oversight.

Title: Lee: President's Syria Proposal Raises Security Questions
Date: May 28, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee said Obama’s announcement to expand support to Syrian rebels raises serious security questions regarding the composition of Syrian opposition forces and the ability of the United States to ensure that terrorist groups do not have access to U.S. assistance.
Last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) passed its annual authorization bill for the Department of Defense, which included a provision that would authorize the Secretary of Defense to provide a broad range of assistance, including lethal aid, to opposition forces in Syria.
“The situation in Syria is desperate and we should be constantly assessing it for threats to U.S. security, but I am concerned that sending American weapons and training into this crisis could be like pouring gas on a fire,” Lee stated. “When senior members of the president’s national security team cannot guarantee that assistance won’t fall into the hands of our enemies, or that the people we train today won’t be fighting alongside al-Qaeda tomorrow, we should be very careful in considering approaches that could assist extremists in that conflict.”
Following the March 6 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), CENTCOM Commander General Lloyd Austin stated in an answer for the record:
“No, we cannot guarantee the assistance we provide doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.  Undoubtedly, some weapons and funds flowing into Syria wind up in the hands of extremists such as Al Nusrah Front or the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL).”
On February 11, during a SASC hearing regarding the relationship of moderate opposition and extremist groups in Syria, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Senator Lee:
“Well, they are an agreement of convenience, I would say.  Oftentimes, these groups will apparently – which are quite fluid, by the way – may disagree ideologically, but will, if it’s convenient for them in a tactical context, agree to work together.”
The bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, was reported out of committee by a vote of 25-1, with Senator Lee as the only “NO” vote due to the Syrian provision, as well as other concerns.

Title: Klobuchar, Lee Call for Review of AT&T’s Proposed Acquisition of DirectTV
Date: May 23, 2014

Content:
Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) today sent a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding AT&T’s proposed acquisition of DirectTV. In the letter, the Senators urged the DOJ and FCC to assess the impact that the proposed merger could have on consumers, including price, choice, and quality of service. Klobuchar, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, and Lee, the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee, will hold a hearing to examine the potential acquisition this summer.
“This proposed transaction would result in additional consolidation in the market for pay television and may impact consumer welfare in that market and other markets in which the companies operate,” the Senators said in the letter. “As always, the key to analyzing any merger should be the effect it will have on consumers, including price, choice, quality of service, and innovation.”
The full text of the letter is below:
Dear Assistant Attorney General Baer and Chairman Wheeler:
As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, we write regarding AT&T’s proposed acquisition of DirecTV.  This proposed transaction would result in additional consolidation in the market for pay television and may impact consumer welfare in that market and other markets in which the companies operate.  For example, the companies currently compete with each other in 25 percent of the country, including in 10 of the top 20 markets.  In addition, this merger, taken together with the recently announced merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, could potentially affect future innovation and technological advances, including the availability of online video distribution.
AT&T and DirecTV state that their merger will create a “competitive alternative to cable for consumers wanting a better bundle of top-quality broadband, video and mobile services, as well as a better customer experience and enhanced innovation.”  The companies further state that increased scale will allow the merged entity to realize cost synergies.
As you review this transaction, we believe it is important to validate and weigh these efficiencies against the potential competitive harms that could result from the transaction.  As always, the key to analyzing any merger should be the effect it will have on consumers, including price, choice, quality of service, and innovation.
We plan to hold a Subcommittee hearing this summer to examine the important issues raised by this proposed merger and will follow up with you based on the evidence and testimony reviewed during that process.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) today released the following statements regarding the AT&T-DirecTV merger. Klobuchar is chair and Lee is ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.
“AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV is yet another merger that has the potential to dramatically change the television market,” Klobuchar said. “As chair of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I will hold a hearing to examine the effect this merger would have on competition, innovation, and the prices, choices, and service offered to consumers across the country.”
“The announcement of an additional merger in the telecommunications and media industry raises concerns about the level of consolidation in these markets,” Lee said. “At the same time, consolidation can benefit consumers in some circumstances.  I look forward to carefully reviewing the evidence and examining the effect this transaction may have on consumer welfare.”

Title: Western Caucuses Urge EPA to Halt “Waters of the US" Rule
Date: May 8, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. –Today, Senator Mike Lee joined Senate Western Caucus Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) and Congressional Western Caucus co-chairs Stevan Pearce (R-NM) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and 42 other Caucus Members in sending a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy.
In their letter, the Caucus members call on the EPA to refrain from moving forward with their controversial “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule that will drastically expand federal regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act. The members also highlight how this rule will negatively impact farms, small businesses, energy production, commercial development and substantially interfere with the ability of individual landowners to use their property.
“We urge you to change course by committing to operating under the limits established by Congress, recognizing the states’ primary role in regulating and protecting their streams, ponds, wetlands and other bodies of water.  We also again ask that you consider the economic impacts of your policies knowing that your actions will have serious impacts on struggling families, seniors, low-income households and small business owners,”Caucus Members wrote.
In addition to Barrasso, Pearce and Lummis, the letter was signed by Senators David Vitter (R-LA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dean Heller (R-NV), Mike Lee (R-UT), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Orrin Hatch (R-UT),  John Thune (R-SD), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Roy Blunt (R-AR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Deb Fischer (R-NE),  John Cornyn (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), Mike Johanns (R-NE),  James Risch (R-ID) and Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Representatives Rob Bishop (UT-01), Markwayne Mullin (OK-01), Jeff Denham (CA-10), Mike Simpson (ID-02), Don Young (AK-AL), Walter Jones (NC-03), Matt Salmon (AZ-05), Scott Tipton (CO-03), Mike Conaway (TX-11), Mark Amadei (NV-02), Cory Gardner (CO-04), Jeff Duncan (SC-03), Chris Stewart (UT-02), Paul Gosar (AZ-04), Tom McClintock (CA-04), Kevin Cramer (ND-AL), Devin Nunes (CA-22), David Schweikert (AZ-06), Randy Neugebaurer (TX-19), Raul Labrador (ID-01), Kristi Noem (SD-AL), Doug Lamborn (CO-05), Trent Franks (AZ-08), Paul Broun (GA-10), Mike Coffman (CO-06), Jason Chaffetz (UT-03).

May 8, 2014
The Honorable Gina McCarthy
Administrator
Environmental Protection Agency
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, DC 20460
Dear Administrator McCarthy,
As members of the Senate and Congressional Western Caucuses, we are contacting you regarding our opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) efforts to significantly expand federal regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act (CWA).
We have reviewed the proposed rule that you signed on March 25th and have concluded that the rule provides essentially no limit to CWA jurisdiction.  This is despite the Supreme Court consistently recognizing that Congress limited the authority of the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers under the CWA.
There has been strong opposition to EPA’s approach due to the devastating economic impacts that a federal takeover of state waters would have.  Additional and substantial regulatory costs associated with changes in jurisdiction and increased permitting requirements will result in  bureaucratic barriers to economic growth, negatively impacting farms, small businesses, commercial development, road construction and energy production, to name a few.
The threat of ruinous penalties for alleged noncompliance with the CWA is also likely to become more common given the proposed rule’s expansive approach.  For example, the EPA’s disputed classification of a small, local creek as a “water of the United States” could cost as much as $187,500 per day in civil penalties for Wyoming resident Andrew Johnson.  Similar uncertainty established under the proposed rule will ensure that expanding federal control over intrastate waters will substantially interfere with the ability of individual landowners to use their property.
We share the concerns expressed by the Western Governors Association regarding the lack of meaningful state consultation in crafting this rule.  The Western Governors stated in a letter to you on March 25th that they –
“are concerned that this rulemaking was developed without sufficient consultation with the states and that the rulemaking could impinge upon state authority in water management.”
We fail to understand why the EPA has not adequately consulted our Governors about a rule that has such a significant impact on the economy of our states.  For example, rural states in the West have sizeable ranching and farming operations that will be seriously impacted by this rule.  Despite the claim that the Army Corps will exempt 53 farming practices as established by the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the list of 53 does not cover all existing agricultural practices.  There are a number of farming and ranching practices, such as the application of pesticides, that are not covered on this list that occur every day in the West without penalty.  Under this new proposed rule, it appears those farmers and ranchers will need to get a permit or be penalized if they continue to use those non-covered practices in new federal waters.
Congress has demonstrated strong opposition to past efforts to have the federal government control all wet areas of the states.  During the recent consideration of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bipartisan group of Senators voted 52 to 44 to reject the EPA’s CWA Jurisdiction Guidance, which would have also resulted in effectively unlimited jurisdiction over intrastate water bodies.  Efforts to pass legislation to have the federal government control all non-navigable waters have also failed in past Congresses.
We urge you to change course by committing to operating under the limits established by Congress, recognizing the states’ primary role in regulating and protecting their streams, ponds, wetlands and other bodies of water.  We also again ask that you consider the economic impacts of your policies knowing that your actions will have serious impacts on struggling families, seniors, low-income households and small business owners.

Title: Lee Introduces Free-Market Energy Reform
Date: May 1, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a bill that restores free-market competition to America’s energy sector by eliminating all tax credits for both renewable and traditional energy sources.  The “Energy Freedom & Economic Prosperity Act” also reduces tax rates to ensure no new burdens are added to the responsible development of America’s energy resources.  Sen. Lee’s bill is a companion to legislation originally sponsored by Rep. Mike Pompeo in the House, which has 34 cosponsors.
“Washington should not be using taxpayer money to pick winners and losers in the energy industry,” said Lee. “Consumer-driven, free-market competition provides a much better way to ensure Americans have access to reliable, affordable energy. The
Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act
would level the playing field for all energy producers, forcing them to compete for consumer dollars rather than political favors.”
Congressman Mike Pompeo said: “American families shouldn’t have to subsidize energy companies when they’re having trouble enough paying their utility bills. Companies should have customers, not political patrons. With Sen. Lee’s leadership in the Senate on this important measure, we can eliminate insider deals on energy policy and save money for families across the country.”
The “Energy Freedom & Economic Prosperity Act” has received support from the American Energy Alliance, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, the Club for Growth, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Freedom Action, Heritage Action, National Taxpayers Union, 60 Plus Association, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Title: Lee’s Opening Statement at Comcast-Time Warner Hearing
Date: April 9, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee, Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, delivered the following remarks at the start of the hearing regarding the merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable:
Today’s hearing has received significant attention, and for good reason. The proposed merger between Comcast and Time-Warner has implications for two markets that affect the everyday lives of the vast majority of those in my state and in the country as a whole. Most Americans pay a monthly bill for video and broadband Internet. In fact, as recently as 2012, ninety percent of U.S. households with a television paid for a TV subscription. And a recent study concluded that approximately 70 percent of U.S. adults over the age of 18 have a broadband access within their home.
The parties to this proposed merger have carefully structured their transaction to maximize chances in an apparent effort of gaining regulatory approval. The two companies assure us that they do not currently compete in each other’s footprint, and the combined company would have less than 30 percent of the video market—a number some have suggested acts as a kind of safe harbor for concentration in that market. Comcast has vertically integrated with NBC Universal—a compiling factor for a large distributor of video content and broadband Internet that is seeking to become larger. But, as the company points out, it remains subject to conditions stemming from regulatory approval of that transaction.
The proposed merger has nonetheless raised some potentially serious concerns. This transaction takes place against the backdrop of significant pre-existing concerns with respect to the competitive state of the market for video and broadband Internet. I have heard concerns for some time that the effects of robust competition, whether experienced in terms of pricing or quality of service, are not currently enjoyed in these markets. It is important that this Committee takes account of the state of competition in the markets for video and Internet as pre-existing issues may make it more likely for a large transaction to pose a competitive threat. At the same time, if concerns related to this transaction result only from issues affecting these industries as a whole, it may be unfair to the merging parties to impose only on them conditions designed to ameliorate competition. Regardless of the outcome of the agencies’ review of this transaction, I believe it is important for Congress to continue to monitor the competitive state of these markets.
Concerns with this transaction also arise from the nature of the services at issue. Internet, in particular, is of obvious importance to American families and businesses. The combined company will potentially control greater than 50 percent of high-speed Internet access in the country. Markets change quickly, and government must be careful not to step in where economic forces will better direct and incentivize future investment and development of new products. But where the stakes are high—and they surely are high with respect to American’s access to the Internet—any potential for anticompetitive effects or undue control of that market must be carefully scrutinized.
This is an extremely large transaction affecting the video and Internet market. A complicating factor arises given that Comcast owns NBC Universal. Considering the significant share of the video and internet market that the new Comcast would have, and the well-known political leanings of NBC, I have heard concerns that Comcast might have the incentive and ability to discriminate against certain political content—namely conservative content.
As with any matter before this Committee or the relevant enforcement agencies, it is essential that we apply proper economic analysis and ground our conclusions in the evidence. By ensuring that we protect competition, and not any individual company or competitor, we can help create market conditions that benefit consumers and promote economic development.

Title: Lee Plans to Offer Amendment to End Comp-Time Discrimination Against Private-Sector Employees
Date: April 8, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – When the Senate moves to the Fair Pay Act, Senator Mike Lee plans to propose an amendment that would give private-sector employers the ability to offer their employees the option of compensation time or overtime pay.
Votes on the Fair Pay Act are expected this week, but it is still unclear whether or not Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow any Republican amendments to be considered if the Senate does move to the bill. For more than a year, Senator Reid has abused the amendment process to prevent GOP priorities from receiving even a vote.
“For many families, especially with young children, their most precious commodity is time,” said Senator Lee.  “But today, federal labor laws restrict the way moms and dads and everyone else can use their time.  For decades, Congress has given a special exemption from these laws to government employees. This is unacceptable. The same work-life options available to government employees should be available to private-sector workers, as well.”
The amendment, modeled on Lee’s “Working Families Flexibility Act,” would help workers handle the constant challenge of work-life balance by allowing private-sector employers to offer all individuals who work overtime to choose between monetary compensation or comp-time through a written agreement.  The reform would maintain all existing employee protections, including the current 40-hour workweek and overtime accrual, and provide additional safeguards to ensure that the choice to use comp time is voluntary.
“We can’t legislate another hour in the day, but we can help working people better balance the demands of family and work by removing an unnecessary federal restriction on utilizing comp time in the private sector,” Lee added.

Title: Lee Files Amendments to Create Jobs, Make Higher-Ed More Accessible, and Improve Work-Life Balance
Date: April 1, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee filed three amendments to a Senate bill being considered this week that would extend the time people have to collect unemployment insurance beyond six months.  The amendments continue Senator Lee’s push to enact solutions to problems in the Obama economy by focusing on job creation, accessibility of higher education and training, and improving work-life balance.
The first amendment is modeled after Sen. Lee’s
Transportation Empowerment Act
(S. 1702)
and would significantly reduce the administrative and regulatory burdens the federal government places on states’ use of transportation funding.  Under this proposal, states could respond more quickly to the needs of citizens, start and finish projects sooner, and spend less money to complete them – all while creating and maintaining good jobs.
“Americans aren’t looking for unemployment insurance, they are looking for employment,” said Senator Lee. “The Democrats’ solution is to keep people tied to unemployment programs, rather than addressing the underlying problem.   My amendment would lift unnecessary burdens government imposes and give states and businesses the freedom to invest, grow, and hire more workers.”
The second amendment is built on Sen. Lee’s
Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act
(S. 1904)
, legislation that would open up new educational opportunities for many low-income and non-traditional students.  The bill allows states to set up a new and parallel system for accrediting educational institutions, curricula, apprenticeships, programs, and even individual courses, which are then available to receive federal student loan money.
“In today’s economy, employers need individuals with specialized skills,” said Senator Lee.  “But the current accreditation system – which drives up costs and leaves behind many non-traditional students, like working parents – acts as a barrier for millions of Americans who need the education and training to fill those jobs.  This amendment would make higher education and training more accessible and affordable to those who need it most.”
The third amendment is based on Sen. Lee’s
Working Family Flexibility Act
(S. 1623)
, which allows private-sector employees the same choice between comp time and overtime pay currently enjoyed by government employees.  Currently, federal law unfairly discriminates against these employees by prohibiting the use of comp time, forcing them to sacrifice family time for the family budget.
“For many families, especially with young children, their most precious commodity is time,” said Sen. Lee. “But today, federal labor laws restrict the way moms and dads and everyone else can use their time. This can lead to tough decisions about how many hours parents can work, or even if they’re able to work at all.  My amendment would make that choice easier and help working families achieve the right balance.”

Title: Lee, Tester Introduce Bill to Ensure Proper Investigations at DOJ
Date: March 13, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced legislation to increase transparency and accountability at the Department of Justice.  The
Inspector General Empowerment Act
would eliminate a problem in the law that requires allegations of attorney misconduct at DOJ to be investigated by an agency that reports directly to the Attorney General rather than the autonomous Office of the Inspector General.  The bill would remove this obvious conflict of interest and grant the OIG complete jurisdiction throughout the department.  Senators Grassley and Murkowski are also original cosponsors.
“The rules that apply to inspectors general in other federal agencies should apply at the Department of Justice,” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Current law invites undue influence from the Attorney General’s office into the process and should be changed to ensure the integrity of investigations of misconduct within the Justice Department.”
“Inspectors General are true watchdogs who save taxpayer dollars and help deliver better services to Americans,” said Tester, Chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the federal workforce and federal programs.  “This bill is a common-sense measure that makes sure taxpayers are getting the level of service they expect and increases oversight of an agency that has enormous powers under the Patriot Act.”
“When Americans pledge to abide by ’Liberty and Justice for all,’ that does not mean that those pursuing justice can creatively apply different standards or break the rules to get convictions – it means everyone that in America everyone is held equally accountable,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski.  “I’m proud to co-sponsor the Inspector General Empowerment Act because it does just that: it gives the men and women charged with judging the actions of attorneys the power to mete out justice within the Justice Department.”
A
report just released
by the Project on Government Oversight revealed that the Office of Professional Responsibility, the agency overseen by the Attorney General, documented more than 650 instances of misconduct, yet details on if and how these cases were handled are not available to the public.
For example, a 2013 report from
USA Today
revealed that complaints from two federal judges who said Justice Department lawyers had misled them about the extent of the NSA surveillance program were never investigated.  Had the OIG been in charge, it could have investigated these complaints without conflict of interest and the results of their report would have been made available without requiring a Freedom of Information Act request.
“Placing this responsibility under the OIG increases government transparency and ensures that instances of abuse will be handled in a timely and responsible manner,” Lee added.

Title: Lee Introduces Head Start Reform
Date: March 12, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced legislation to reform the early childhood education program known as Head Start.  The
Head Start Improvement Act
is intended to produce better results by offering states and parents greater flexibility to tailor the program to meet the specific needs of low-income children.  A
2012 study by the Obama administration
showed that, despite spending $8.6 billion per year on education, health, nutrition, and other services, the program produced no lasting benefits.
“Underprivileged children need access to good education, and the scientific evidence shows the federal government does a lousy job of providing it,” Senator Lee said. “Education reform should empower principals, teachers and parents, instead of centralizing power and money in political bureaucracies. This bill would allow states, communities, schools, and families to better tailor pre-K programs to the specific needs of each eligible child.”
Confronted with the obvious failures of government programs, many states are already looking at ways to better serve their low-income populations.  For example, the Utah state legislature has created a special task force to study the prospects of “charity care” – affordable medical services for poor families provided not by government but by individuals, businesses, non-profit groups, and local communities.
“The Utah Model might not work in every state, but every state should have the freedom to solve problems their own way, according to their own values and priorities,” Lee added.
How it Works:
Provides Head Start block grants directly to eligible grantees, which include states, territories and federally recognized Indian tribes.
Restores the responsibility to each recipient grantee to define what entities within their state would be eligible to receive sub-grants; award sub-grants to those eligible entities; establish rules and standards for the entities awarded sub-grants; and monitor compliance with state rules and standards
Eligible grantees receive an allotment of the Head Start funds in proportion to the number of children aged 5 and younger from families with incomes below 130% of the poverty line residing within their State.
Eligible grantees must provide a 20% match to all Federal Head Start funds granted, consistent with current law.
All funds must be used for prekindergarten education, administration of the programs, and to provide direct technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research and training.
What it Does:
Puts more money in the classroom instead of the Washington bureaucracy
Gives states and local officials and parents greater control over improving the Head Start program
Ensures the program will better serve the interest of low-income families with young children

Title: Lee: President’s Transportation Proposal is the Same Old Idea
Date: February 26, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement on the president’s transportation proposal:
“Today, the president has offered the country the same old idea: send more money to Washington where the special interests get their cut, the politicians get the credit, and future generations get the bill. Unfortunately, his proposal is more about preserving a dysfunctional system than improving our roads. It's a top-down, DC-knows-best approach to do to our transportation infrastructure what Obamacare has done to our health care.
“Conservatives have a fresh approach that will save money, reduce commuting times, grow the economy and create jobs, and allow state and local officials, who are ultimately responsible for infrastructure projects, to respond more quickly to the transportation needs of each state.
“The Transportation Empowerment Act creates a new system where Americans would no longer have to send significant gas-tax revenue to Washington, where politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists siphon off precious resources before sending it back to the states with strings attached. Instead, under this proposal, states and cities could plan, finance, and build better-designed and more affordable projects.
“Some communities could choose to build more roads, while others might prefer to repair old ones. Some might build highways, others light-rail. And all would be free to experiment with innovative green technologies, and new ways to finance their projects, like congestion pricing and smart tolls.
“All states and localities should finally have the flexibility to develop the kind of transportation system they want, for less money, without politicians and special interests from other parts of the country telling them how, when, what, and where they should build.”

Title: Lee, Hatch, Bishop Applaud Approval for New F-35 Hangar at Hill Air Force Base
Date: February 26, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Rob Bishop (UT-1) today announced that both the Senate and House have approved funding for the construction of a new maintenance hangar at Hill Air Force Base for the F-35 stealth fighter jet. Operational maintenance will be performed inside the hangar by the 388th Fighter Wing based at Hill. The funding was originally included in the 2014 National Defense Appropriations Act, but was removed in the Omnibus Bill. Hatch, Lee and Bishop have repeatedly pushed the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Appropriations committee, respectively, to allow and approve the Department of Defense to reprogram funding needed for this construction. Now that all relevant committees have approved the reprogramming of funding, the U.S. Air Force can begin construction on the complex.
"I am pleased that this funding has been approved and that the Air Force can finally start construction at Hill,” said Lee, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “The arrival of the F-35 in Northern Utah next year begins a significant new chapter for the Air Force and our state, and having the facilities ready for this delivery is of upmost importance to protecting and maintaining the taxpayer's investment in this weapons system. We are excited that the future of military innovation and technological advancement is continuing to be forged in our state."
“Hill Air Force Base is a shining star in the Air Force and this new facility will ensure that the hard-working personnel on the base have the resources they need to maintain the military’s next generation aircraft,” Hatch said. “There’s much more work to do and I look forward to working with our congressional delegation and state and military leaders to continue to ensure that Hill remains a world-class facility.”
“I am glad that we have been able to secure approval for the funding of this very important project at Hill Air Force Base,” Bishop added. “The modernization of the hangar is necessary to support the new F-35s, which are scheduled to arrive at Hill next year. Just as we fought diligently to ensure funding for the hangar, we continue to work with our colleagues in the House and Senate as well as the Department of Defense for approval of a new fire station that will be strategically located to support the F-35 and other infrastructure at the base.”

Title: Sens. Cruz and Lee Introduce State Marriage Defense Act
Date: February 13, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, today introduced S. 2024, the State Marriage Defense Act, which respects the definition of marriage held by the people of each state and protects states from the federal government’s efforts to force any other definition upon them. The bill will ensure the federal government gives the same deference to the 33 states that define marriage as the union between one man and one woman as it does to the 17 states that have chosen to recognize same-sex unions.
“I support traditional marriage. Under President Obama, the federal government has tried to re-define marriage, and to undermine the constitutional authority of each state to define marriage consistent with the values of its citizens,” said Sen. Cruz. “The Obama Administration should not be trying to force gay marriage on all 50 states. We should respect the states, and the definition of marriage should be left to democratically elected legislatures, not dictated from Washington. This bill will safeguard the ability of states to preserve traditional marriage for its residents.”
“How a state should define marriage should be left up to the citizens of each state,” said Sen. Lee. “It is clear the Obama administration finds the principles of federalism inconvenient in its effort to force states to redefine the institution of marriage. The State Marriage Defense Act provides an important protection for states, respecting the right to choose for themselves how each will treat the institution of marriage under the law.”
In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court improperly held Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to be unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's reasoning requires the federal government to respect the primacy of the states in defining marriage.
Unfortunately, since the Windsor decision, the Obama Administration’s agenda to force same-sex marriage has led both to the violation of these principles and to the rise of inconsistencies among several federal agencies that either look to the law of the state where an individual lives to determine eligibility for marital benefits or recognize marriages based solely on the law of the state where a marriage ceremony was held.
The State Marriage Defense Act will correct this inconsistency and protect states from an out of control administration that is seeking to force same sex marriage upon states that define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.

Title: Lee Introduces Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act
Date: February 12, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a bill to address the deep problems in the federal government’s welfare programs that make it more difficult for low-income Americans to work their way into the middle class and stay there.  The “Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act” would get existing federal welfare programs under control and would help the working poor transition from poverty to opportunity and security.
“Poverty is not just the absence of money, but also the absence of opportunity,” said Sen. Lee. “Today’s poverty programs place artificial restraints on those who are trying to get ahead, build careers and provide better lives for themselves and their families. Successful welfare programs are those that make poverty more temporary, not more tolerable, and we need to move current policy in that direction.   The Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act will give all low-income Americans the opportunity to earn a good living and build a good life.”
"The enormous success of welfare reform in the 1990s--as millions were able to leave welfare and find good-paying jobs--demonstrates that government welfare need not trap people in dependency," said Sen. Cruz.  "Instead, the object of government assistance should be to help those who are struggling through difficult times and, at the same time, make it easier for them to find a good job and stand on their own feet.  The dignity of a job, of providing for your family, is transformative; and everyone deserves a fair chance at the American dream.  We know that welfare reform works, and this legislation will expand that successful formula across the multitude of federal assistance programs."
The Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act corrects and strengthens current welfare programs by restoring work incentives for individuals and families, improving state administration of welfare programs, rewarding states that transition beneficiaries from welfare to work, and imposing greater transparency in means-tested welfare spending.
The bill has been cosponsored by Senators Cruz, Vitter, and Inhofe.
The bill has been endorsed by the National Taxpayers Union, Heritage Action for America, the Association of Mature American Citizens, and the Concerned Women for America.

Title: Lee Outlines Higher Education Reform at Policy Summit
Date: February 10, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee outlined legislation that would greatly expand access to higher education for many working- and middle-class students, as well as many individuals seeking non-traditional forms of education.
In a speech at the Conservative Policy Summit, sponsored by Heritage Action for America, Lee argued that federal policy on higher education has not kept up with technology and, as a result, is leaving millions of students behind.
“Today, technology has made it possible for students to take classes from professors in another state; for academics to conduct research with colleagues across oceans; and for anyone with an iPad to carry a library around in their backpack,” said Lee.
“For the first time in history, students don’t have to
go to college
to go to college,” Lee added. “Unfortunately, this innovative, alternative market is being cordoned-off from the vast majority of students by increasingly outdated federal policy governing higher-education accreditation.”
He explained that the problem is the current federal accreditation policy, which only allows degree-issuing institutions to be accredited and, therefore, ensures only they can receive federal student loans.  Blocking out competition for education dollars drives up the cost of getting a degree.
“In effect, Washington’s offer to most Americans after high school is: go tens of thousands of dollars into non-dischargeable debt to pursue an over-priced degree there’s no guarantee you’ll receive, or spend the rest of your life locked out of the middle class,” said Lee.
To fix this, Lee has recently introduced the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act (S. 1904).  The bill would allow states to voluntarily create parallel accreditation systems that expand educational options eligible for federal student loan dollars.
“There are too many valuable opportunities and invaluable people current law excludes. It’s time to decouple Title IV eligibility and enrollment at degree-issuing institutions,” said Lee.
“In higher education, as in so many other areas, the greatest threats to equal opportunity are the unintended consequences of dysfunctional policies. The current system has helped a lot of people, but it has left many others behind.  Reform needs to circle back and make equal opportunity a reality for
everyone

Title: Bipartisan Group of Senators Push for Congressional Vote Before Extending Afghanistan Troop Presence
Date: February 6, 2014

Content:
Washington, DC- Today, Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Mike Lee (R-UT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Rand Paul (R-KY) announced the introduction of a bipartisan resolution calling for Congress to have a role in approving any further United States military involvement in Afghanistan after the current mission ends on December 31, 2014. The Administration is reportedly negotiating an agreement that could keep 10,000 American troops or more in Afghanistan for another ten years.
“The American people should weigh in and Congress should vote before we decide to commit massive resources and thousands of troops to another decade in Afghanistan,” Merkley said. “After over 12 years of war, the public deserves a say. Congress owes it to the men and women in uniform to engage in vigorous oversight on decisions of war and peace.”
"After over a decade of war, Congress, and more importantly the American people, must be afforded a voice in this debate,” Lee said. “The decision to continue to sacrifice our blood and treasure in this conflict should not be made by the White House and Pentagon alone."
“After 13 years, more than 2,300 American lives lost and more than $600 billion, it is time to bring our brave warriors home to the hero’s welcome they deserve and begin rebuilding America, not Afghanistan,” Manchin said. “We do not have an ally in President Karzai and his corrupt regime. His statements and actions have proven that again and again. Most West Virginians believe like I do money or military might won’t make a difference in Afghanistan. It’s time to bring our troops home.”
“The power to declare war resides in the hands of Congress,” Paul said. “If this President  or any future President has the desire to continue to deploy U.S. troops to this region, it should be done so only with the support of Congress and the citizens of the United States.”
After 12 years and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, the Administration has declared that the war in Afghanistan will be wound down by December 31, 2014. However, the Administration is also negotiating an agreement with the Government of Afghanistan that would set guidelines for U.S. troops to remain in training, support, and counter-terrorism roles through at least 2024.
In November, the Senators introduced this bill as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, but it wasn’t allowed a vote. In June, the House of Representatives approved a similar amendment to the NDAA stating that it is the Sense of Congress that if the President determines that it is necessary to maintain U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014, any such presence and missions should be authorized by Congress.  The House amendment passed by a robust, bipartisan 305-121 margin.

Title: Senators Introduce Resolution Denouncing Obama Administration’s Coercion of States with Common Core
Date: February 5, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) will introduce a resolution strongly denouncing the Obama Administration’s coercion of states into adopting Common Core State Standards by conferring preferences in federal grants and flexibility waivers.
The resolution is co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Thad Cochran (R-Mississippi), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), and Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming).
“The Obama Administration has effectively bribed and coerced states into adopting Common Core,” said Graham.  “Blanket education standards should not be a prerequisite for federal funding.  In order to have a competitive application for some federal grants and flexibility waivers, states have to adopt Common Core.  This is simply not the way the Obama Administration should be handling education policy. Our resolution affirms that education belongs in the hands of our parents, local officials and states.”
“It is crucial that the money being spent on education in Oklahoma be controlled by Oklahomans who are familiar with the needs of our schools and students,” said Inhofe. “This is why I am proud to join Senator Graham in introducing a resolution that enforces vital education practices of leaving the decisions of children's educational needs to the state and the parents.
“Educational decisions are best made by parents and teachers – not bureaucrats in Washington,” said Scott.  “While Common Core started out as a state-led initiative, the federal government unfortunately decided to use carrots and sticks to coerce states into adopting national standards and assessments. That is simply the wrong choice for our kids.”
“Common Core is another example of Washington trying to control all aspects of Americans’ lives, including the education of our children,” said Cruz.  “We should not allow the federal government to dictate what our children learn; rather, parents, through their teachers, local schools and state systems, should be able to direct the education of their children.”
“Common Core has become polluted with Federal guidelines and mandates that interfere with the ability of parents, teachers and principals to deliver the education our children deserve,” said Lee.  “Rather than increasing coercion, we should be demanding that further interference by the U.S. Department of Education with respect to state decisions on academic content standards be eliminated.”
“Decisions about what content students should be taught have enormous consequences for children and so should be made as close as possible to the affected parents and students,” said Grassley.  “Federal interference in this area disrupts the direct line of accountability between parents and those making decisions about their children’s education.  It also takes away needed flexibility from state education leaders to make changes as they learn more about what works and what does not.”
“This Administration favors a national school board approach to education and likes to ignore individual states’ decisions,” said Enzi. “It uses ‘free’ money as the carrot to dangle in front of the states. In effect it is trying to force states into accepting a one-size-fits-all approach. This coercion with Common Core is another example of the federal government trampling on states’ rights and is the wrong approach to fixing our education system in this country.”
The major provisions of the resolution affirm:
Education belongs in the hands of parents, local education officials, and states.
The federal government should not coerce states into adopting common education standards.
No future application process for any federal grant funds or waivers should award additional points, or provide any preference, for the adoption of Common Core.
FACT SHEET
Purpose of the Resolution:
Strongly denounces President Obama’s coercion of states into adopting Common Core by conferring preferences in federal grants and flexibility waivers.
Strongly supports the restoration and protection of state authority and flexibility in establishing and defining challenging student academic standards and assessments.
What the Resolution States:
Education belongs in the hands of parents, local education officials, and states.
The federal government should not coerce states into adopting common education standards.
No application process for any federal grant funds or waivers should award additional points, or provide any preference, for the adoption of Common Core.
The link between adoption of common education standards and federal funds will result in increased federal control over education.
The resolution does not retract any federal funds or waivers already issued to states.
The resolution does not evaluate the content of the Common Core standards already developed and adopted by states.

Title: Lee: Farm Bill is a Monument to Washington Dysfunction
Date: February 4, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Mike Lee blasted the
Agriculture Act of 2014
, also known as the Farm Bill, as a “Beltway marriage of convenience between welfare and corporate welfare,” and criticized the use of PILT payments, critical funding for Utah’s small, rural communities, as a political football.
“This Farm Bill is a monument to every dysfunction Washington indulges to bend our politics and twist our economy to benefit itself at the expense of the American people,” said Sen. Lee.  He added that the Farm Bill is “collusion between both parties against the American people; it benefits the special interests at the expense of the national interest.”
Lee outlined several offensive provisions included in the bill, such as sugar industry subsidies and the Christmas-tree tax, but reserved his greatest criticism for holding PILT payments hostage in order to facilitate passage of this deeply flawed legislation.  Lee called it a “bullying, disenfranchising shake-down of the American west.”
“To compensate local governments for the tax revenue Washington unfairly denies them, Congress created – as only Congress could - the PILT program, which stands for Payment In Lieu of Taxes,” explained Lee.  “Under PILT, Congress sends a few cents on the dollar out west every year to make up for lost property taxes. There is no guaranteed amount. Washington just sends what it feels like.”
[

]
“I have been on the phone with county commissioners for weeks, who feel they have no choice but to support a policy they know doesn’t work. This bill takes away their ability to plan and budget with certainty, and forces them to come back to Congress, hat in hand, every year. County Commissioners know this is no way to run a community. I share their frustration, and I applaud their commitment to their neighbors and communities.”
Lee argued the best way to help the small rural communities that depend on PILT payments is to make the program permanent, rather than forcing Congress to authorize it each year.
“I’m convinced that in the long run, the best way to protect these communities is to find a real, permanent solution that gives them the certainty and equality they deserve.  My vote against the Farm Bill will be a vote to rescue Utahns from second-class citizenship, and local communities in my state from permanent dependence on the whims of faraway politicians.”

Title: Lee to Holder: Explain Constitutional Basis for Executive Action on Minimum Wage, Delaying Employer Mandate
Date: January 29, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee asked Attorney General Holder to explain the President’s constitutional authority to take executive action to delay the employer mandate and raise the minimum wage.   When Holder was unable to explain the analysis, Lee called for the Department of Justice to release documents that explain the decision “so that the American people can be aware of what’s happening and on what basis [the President] is claiming that authority.”
Lee: “…Is this [constitutional] analysis undertaken each time the president issues an executive order and…was it undertaken when the president, for example, announced on July 2
nd
, 2013, that he would not be enforcing the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act…?”
Holder: “…Those kinds of activities are done after consultation with the Justice Department and an analysis is done to make sure the President is acting in an appropriate and a constitutional way…”
Lee: “In which of those three categories would you put the president’s decision to delay the employer mandate?”
Holder: “To be honest with you, I have not seen – I don’t remember looking at or having – I haven’t seen the analysis in some time so I’m not sure exactly where along the spectrum that would come…”
Lee: “How about the executive order he proposed last night with regard to minimum wage?”
Holder: “Um, again, without having delved into this to any great degree that would-“
Lee: “But you’re the Attorney General. I’m assuming he consulted you.”
Holder: “Well, there have been consultations done with the Justice Department…”
Lee: “It would be very helpful for you to release legal analysis produced by the Office of Legal Counsel, or whoever is advising the President on these issues…”
Holder: “…[The president] has made far less use of his executive power at this point in his administration than some of his predecessors have and he will only do so, as I indicated previously, where he is unable to work with Congress to do things together…”
Lee: “General Holder, I respectfully but forcefully disagree with the assertion, if this is what you’re saying, that because the number of orders issued by this president might be comparable to the number of executive orders issued by previous presidents that that means he hasn’t made more use of it then other presidents have.  When you look at the quality – not just the quantity, but the quality – the nature of the executive orders that he has issued, he has usurped an extraordinary amount of authority within the executive branch.  This is not precedented. And I point to the delay – the unilateral delay – lawless delay, in my opinion, of the employer mandate as an example of this.”

Title: Excerpts from Sen. Lee’s Response to the President’s State of the Union Speech
Date: January 28, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Tonight, Senator Mike Lee will give the Tea Party response to the president’s State of the Union speech.  It can be viewed below:
The following are selected excerpts of Sen. Lee’s remarks:
“In America, the test of any political movement is not what that movement is against, but what it is
for
.  The founders made a point at Boston Harbor, but they made history in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall.”
“Today, Americans know in their hearts that something is wrong.  Much of what is wrong relates to the sense that the ‘American Dream’ is falling out of reach for far too many of us. We are facing an inequality crisis — one to which the President has paid lip-service, but seems uninterested in truly confronting or correcting.
”
“But where does this new inequality come from? From
government
— every time it takes rights and opportunities away from the American people and gives them instead to politicians, bureaucrats, and special interests.”
“Throughout the last five years, President Obama has promised an economy for the middle class; but all he’s delivered is an economy for the middle-men.”
“We have a new generation of leaders in Washington with positive, innovative
ideas
– thoughtful policy reforms to, as my friend Senator Ted Cruz says –“Make D.C. listen.”  Reforms to help poor families work their way into the middle class, to help middle-class families start to get ahead, and to level the playing field and put corporate and political insiders back to work for the rest of us.”
“All of these proposals within this new conservative reform agenda, along with many more to come, mark the road to Philadelphia.  These principles and these policies will work - and will put Americans back to work. Not just by cutting big government, but by
fixing
broken government.  Not just by making government smaller but by promoting bigger citizens, stronger families and more heroic communities. Our goal should be an America where everyone has a fair chance to pursue happiness - and find it. That’s what it looks like when protest grows into reform.”

Title: Lee, Hatch Push to Restore Funding for PILT program
Date: January 16, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Utah’s U.S. Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch are supporting an amendment to the Omnibus government funding bill introduced by Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) that would fully fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program.  The amendment, which is paid for by reducing US spending on overseas programs, would provide $421 million for PILT in Fiscal Year 2014.  Local governments receive federal payments under the PILT program to help compensate for the loss of property tax revenue due to non-taxable federal lands within their boundaries.
“More than 60 percent of the land in Utah is owned by the federal government, which means that communities across the state cannot collect property taxes to help fund basic community needs,” Hatch said. “PILT ensures that Utahns have access to the services they need even though the federal government owns such a significant amount of land in our state. Utah’s county commissioners have repeatedly stressed to me how important the PILT program is, and I sincerely hope this fight to fully fund this necessary program is successful.”
"For many counties in Utah, these PILT payments represent a large percentage of annual budgets,” said Lee. “Police, schools, and infrastructure maintenance all rely heavily on these payments. The failure to fund this program in a 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill is simply stunning. That failure is precisely why I am cosponsoring this amendment which would cut wasteful programs and fully fund PILT."
In addition to Hatch and Lee, the Barrasso amendment was cosponsored by Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY),  Dean Heller (R-NV), James Inhofe (R-OK), James Risch (R-ID), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and John Hoeven (R-ND).
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The funding for PILT is offset by reductions of $421 million from the following international climate change programs under the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act:
U.S. Contributions to the Global Environment Facility (GEF)- $143.75 million
U.S. Contributions to the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) - $184.63 million
U.S. Contributions to the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) - $49.9 million
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change - $10 million
Sustainable Landscape programs in the bilateral economic assistance through the economic support fund - $32.72 million.
The GEF is an international financial institution that receives U.S. contributions to help address global climate change and other environmental issues.
The CTF and the SCF are investment trust funds administered by the multilateral development banks which finance low-carbon technologies and climate-resilient development in foreign countries.

Title: Lee Reacts to Oral Argument in Recess Appointments Case
Date: January 13, 2014

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee said that he expects the Supreme Court to determine that President Obama’s controversial recess appointments from January 2012 were unconstitutional.  Sen. Lee, who is a former Supreme Court clerk for Justice Samuel Alito, has been a strong and vocal opponent of President Obama’s attempt to usurp the rights of the Senate in the appointment and confirmation of nominees to the executive and judicial branch.  He attended the oral argument today in the case of
National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning
.
“After hearing oral arguments today, I am very confident the Supreme Court will affirm the DC Circuit Court’s judgment in
NLRB v Noel Canning
and determine that the president’s recess appointments on January 4, 2012, were unconstitutional,” said Sen. Lee. “In making the appointments, the president took a power that does not belong to him. It rightfully belongs to the American people, through their representatives in the Senate, and is an essential constitutional check on the executive branch.  I am confident the Supreme Court will restore the Senate’s prerogatives and condemn this assault on the rule of law.”

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Expand Higher Education Opportunities
Date: January 9, 2014

Content:
WASHNGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced legislation that would expand higher education opportunities for low-income and middle-class families by providing for new alternatives to the federal accreditation system. The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act would allow all 50 states and the District of Columbia to develop their own systems of accrediting educational institutions, curricula, apprenticeships, programs, and even individual courses.  All accredited programs would be eligible to receive federal student loan money.
“The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act would not only make the cost of higher education more affordable, but also make it easier for students to customize their own education and gain the specific skills they need to compete in today’s economy,” said Sen. Lee. “Today’s higher education system is falling behind on students’ increasingly diverse higher education needs and the resistance to change stifles the emergence of new education models than can be much more effective and affordable. The HERO Act will open the floodgates of innovation, providing greater choice, access, and opportunity for America’s students.”
The HERO Act does not replace the current accreditation system.  It simply permits states, if they choose, to set up their own systems to accredit alternative institutions, programs, or courses.  Because these new systems would be eligible for federal dollars, each proposal would still have to gain the approval of the Secretary of Education through an agreement with the state.
“Our current higher education system is controlled by the iron triangle of regional accreditation organizations, the schools and federal bureaucrats,” Lee added. “The result is the exploding cost of higher education, which either prevents students from getting the educational experience they need or forces them to take on unnecessarily large amounts of debt. We can do better by opening up new avenues of opportunity that make education more affordable and accessible.”
More information:
The Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) Act
Authorizes states to create an alternative, state-run process for accreditation, providing the state with the same authority as the Secretary of Education has in selecting the institutions eligible to participate in Title IV funding.
Allows States to accredit any institution, that provides postsecondary education (courses or programs) that can be applied to a degree, credential or professional certification, including:
Institutions of Higher Learning (Colleges/Universities);
Non-profit Organizations;
For-profit Organizations or Businesses; and
Postsecondary apprenticeship programs.
Requires States to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Education prior to creating their own process for accreditation.  These agreements would include:
The designation of one or more accrediting entities within the State;
The standards/criteria that an institution must meet in order to become accredited and maintain accreditation;
The appeals process for an entity that is denied accreditation;
The State policy regarding the transfer of credits;
The agreed upon reporting requirements, which may include:
The number of students who successfully complete each course or program;
The number of students who successfully obtain their certification, credential or degree;
Job placement for individuals who had obtained their certification, credential or degree;
How often the agreed upon reports will be submitted to the Secretary; and
Any requirements for third-party verification of the information in the reports.
The State policy regarding public access to information related to State accredited programs and entities;
An assurance by the State that it will only accredit institutions offering postsecondary education courses or programs that provide credits toward a postsecondary certification, credential or degree;
A clear statement of the State’s definition of a postsecondary certification, credential and degree;
A description of the agreements the State will enter into with institutions accredited under this system;
A description of how the State will select institutions for accreditation under this system; and
A description of how the State plans to administer Title IV funds for institutions it accredits under the alternative accreditation system.
Assists States in covering the administrative and reporting costs associated with the alternative accreditation system in the same manner that assistance is currently provided to institutions of higher education.

Title: Lee: Utah to Lose $32 Million in Budget Deal
Date: December 16, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced that under the recent Senate-House budget deal, the state of Utah would lose approximately $32 million in payments from the federal government.
Under the Mineral Leasing Act, the federal government leases federal land for the development of energy, minerals and other materials, and shares the revenue with the states in which the leases are held.  The revenue is currently split evenly between the states and the federal government.  Section 302 of the budget deal would only decrease what the states receive, leaving the federal portion intact. That would mean a total reduction of $415 million for the states, with roughly $32 million coming from Utah.
“It is unfortunate that the budget targets the mineral leasing program,” said Sen. Lee, who sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “Many of Utah’s rural communities depend on this funding and we shouldn’t be pulling the rug out from under them when there are so many other wasteful and ineffective programs in the federal government to reform.”

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee and eleven original cosponsors introduced legislation to protect religious organizations from discrimination by the federal government for supporting traditional marriage.  The “Marriage and Religious Freedom Act” bars the government from denying any person or group tax-exempt status for exercising their religious conscience rights. The bill is cosponsored by Senators Vitter, Rubio, Roberts, Hatch, Coburn, Blunt, Inhofe, Wicker, Risch, Cochran and Graham.
“This bill protects the rights of individuals and organizations from religious discrimination by the federal government,” said Senator Lee. “Those who believe in the traditional definition of marriage deserve respect and tolerance.  It is critical that we clarify the law to ensure that their fundamental civil liberties are not at risk.”
A companion bill, HR 3133, was introduced in the House by Rep. Raul Labrador and has 92 cosponsors.
The “Marriage and Religious Freedom Act” has been endorsed by the United States Conference Of Catholic Bishops, Family Research Council, National Organization For Marriage, Heritage Action, Concerned Women For America, The Ethics And Religious Liberty Commission Of The Southern Baptist Convention, and Liberty Counsel Action.

Title: Lee Opposes House-Senate Budget Deal
Date: December 11, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Lee released the following statement on the budget deal recently announced by the Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees:
“Rather than enacting reforms to make government more efficient, the budget deal makes more government more expensive. Sequestration is far from ideal, but at least it forced Congress get serious about excessive spending. This deal cuts into the modest gains taxpayers have won since 2011, by trading concrete spending reductions over the next two years for theoretical spending cuts a decade from now. In the meantime, the deal raises taxes on all air travellers, so that Congress can continue to ignore both waste in discretionary spending and the ticking fiscal time-bomb of our entitlement programs.
“I do not envy House Republicans in their task of negotiating a budget with a Senate majority and president hostile to the very idea of having one. But the deal they have struck is not one I can support.
“If there is a silver lining in this deal, it at least further confirms the need for Republicans to finally develop a comprehensive conservative reform agenda. Real reform involves not simply cutting dysfunctional programs, but fixing them so government doesn’t cost so much in the first place. And as Democrats continue to hide from those reforms at the behest of their special-interest clients, Republicans must begin to advance our ideas openly and transparently, not behind closed doors up against artificial deadlines set by the forces of the status quo.”

Title: Sen. Lee Hosts Poverty Roundtable
Date: December 4, 2013

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Today, Senator Mike Lee hosted a roundtable with Utah citizens, experts, government officials, and community activists on the growing crisis of immobility among the poor.  The event is a continuation of Sen. Lee’s “Let’s Talk” series he began in August, taking him around the state to hear directly from Utahns about the critical issues facing the state and the country.
Today’s panel, held at the Sutherland Institute, presented an opportunity for those who work in Utah communities to fight poverty to discuss their work with Senator Lee and present ideas for solving the problems they face in promoting upward mobility among the disadvantaged.  The roundtable included representatives from Utah Department of Work Force Services, Calvary Baptist Church, Utah Food Bank, 4th Street Clinic, United Way, and Standing Together.
“America's true war on poverty began at the founding of this country,” said Senator Lee after the event. “It was our dedication to economic freedom and voluntary civil society that liberated millions of American families, opening up opportunities for the pursuit of happiness never known before or since.  In that tradition, it should be government’s role today to give struggling Americans greater access to the benefits of free enterprise, the greatest weapon against poverty ever conceived by man.”
With Senator Lee, the group discussed changes in federal and state policy to remove barriers that trap people in poverty and make upward mobility all but impossible.  Topics included welfare reform, access to quality affordable health care, removing anti-marriage biases in federal policy, ways to help keep families intact, increasing educational opportunities, and Medicaid reform.
“As the family goes, so goes society. We need to focus on the role of the father in the family,” said a representative of Standing Together. “It’s time that someone in Washington speak about moral issues. Poverty is a moral issue.”
“Having federal funds helps, but the regulations that come with those funds do not help the cause. We need flexibility,” added an employee of the Department of Work Services.
Senator Lee will continue his “Let’s Talk” series this week with meetings on health care, transportation, education and patent reform.

Title: Hatch, Bishop, Lee Applaud Air Force Announcement on F-35
Date: December 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, and U.S. Representative Rob Bishop applauded the U.S. Air Force’s official announcement that Hill Air Force Base will be the first operational squadron of the F-35 stealth fighter starting in 2015.  The Air Force issued its final record of decision this morning at the conclusion of a 30-day waiting period that followed the completion of the Environmental Impact Statement.  The decision signals the continuation of the enduring partnership between the Air Force and the state of Utah that has mutually benefited U.S. National Security and the Utah community for decades.
“Today’s announcement is the final step before the first operation squadron of the U.S. Air Force’s next generation of aircraft comes to Utah,” Hatch said. “The review process for the delivery of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was extensive, and the world class facilities and wonderful personnel at Hill Air Force and throughout our state make this the right choice for our state and our country. I’ve been proud to stand with the Utah congressional delegation and state leaders to continue pushing for this opportunity for Utah and our country, and I look forward to seeing the F-35 at Hill soon.”
“The Air Force’s final record of decision is a clear vote of confidence in the future of Hill Air Force Base.  The F-35 has been referred to as the ‘backbone of U.S. air combat for the next generation’ and today’s announcement confirms that Hill Air Force Base, the Ogden Air Logistics Center, and the Utah Test and Training Range remain the preeminent training grounds for air combat technologies. The unique capabilities of the support systems at Hill AFB, comprised of active duty and reserve military personnel as well as civilian defense workers, are second to none. This decision is very good news for Utah and I look forward to the arrival of the new squadrons,” said Congressman Bishop, a senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee.
"I am pleased to hear the announcement by the Air Force today to base the first operational squadrons of the F-35A in Utah,” said Sen. Lee, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Given the outstanding facilities at Hill AFB, the proximity to the Ogden Air Logistics Complex and the Utah Test and Training Range, and the incredible support that the Air Force enjoys from the Northern Utah community, this decision is a logical choice.  The Air Force has a unique relationship with the state of Utah that cannot be replicated anywhere else in the country, and I am excited to see that this relationship will continue to grow well into the future."

Title: Leahy & Lee Introduce Legislation To Protect Innovators Against Patent Lawsuit Abuse
Date: November 18, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Committee member Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined together Monday to introduce legislation to protect businesses and innovators who are being improperly targeted by patent trolls.
The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act of 2013 would increase transparency in patent ownership, protect customers who are sued for patent infringement by allowing the case against them to be stayed while the manufacturer litigates the suit, target the widespread sending of frivolous demand letters, and improve resources for small businesses that are targeted in patent infringement suits, among other provisions.  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) is an original cosponsor of the bill.
“America’s patent system is the envy of the world, but unfortunately some bad actors are misusing the system to sue unsuspecting consumers or extort monetary settlements by making misleading demands,” Leahy said.  “When small businesses in Vermont and across the country are threatened with lawsuits for offering wi-fi to their customers or using document scanners in their offices, we can all agree the system is not being used as intended.  The bipartisan legislation I am introducing today takes important steps to protect those who are targeted by patent trolls while preserving what has made America’s patent system great.”
Leahy added: “I thank Senator Lee and Senator Whitehouse for joining me in this effort and I applaud Chairman Goodlatte and members from both parties who are working to address this problem. I look forward to working through the Committee process with other Senatorsto develop effective legislation that will help innovators and inventors succeed.”
“Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure that our system of intellectual property ‘promote[s] the progress of science and the useful arts.’ Our patent system must protect legitimate property rights and encourage innovation,” Lee said.  “Recently, we have seen increased abuse of the patent system in a way that actually discourages innovation and growth of the economy.  This legislation, together with other proposals introduced by members of the Judiciary Committee, will restore the proper balance to the patent system.”
Leahy and Lee previously announced their intent to introduce legislation on this issue and their collaboration with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte in an
op-ed
published earlier this year.  Leahy has also pressed the Administration to assist in addressing the problem of patent trolls, urging the Federal Trade Commission in June to more aggressively pursue enforcement actions against patent trolls using its consumer protection authority.

Title: Lee, Hatch Respond to Administration’s Last-Minute Delay of Nearly 100,000 Acres in Utah for Energy Leasing
Date: November 15, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch responded to the announcement by the Bureau of Land Management that it will be deferring nearly 100,000 acres from the proposed oil and gas lease auction on Tuesday, November 19. The BLM announcement that it will reduce the land available at auction by nearly 70% comes just days before sale was scheduled; once again proving the administration's repeated promises of transparency and open communication are empty.
“At a time when the State of Utah, local counties, and Utah's federal delegation are participating in a large scale initiative to resolve many long-standing public land issues, this last-minute bait and switch only reinforces the widespread belief that, under this Administration, BLM is becoming a vehicle for policies created by radical environmentalists,” said Senator Lee.  “This bureaucratic maneuvering does more than hurt the companies that were ready, willing, and able to participate in Tuesday's auction.  It discourages companies from participating in future auctions, and perhaps ever investing in states that are dominated by federal land ownership. The cumulative impact of this and other similar actions serves to drive investment away from the families and communities that live near lands managed by the federal government. In order to thrive, these communities need a good faith partner in the BLM.”
“This misguided announcement by the Bureau of Land Management to defer the leasing of 100,000 acres for energy production because of pressure from environmental elites ironically comes on the heels of news last month that the United States produced more oil than it imported,” said Hatch. “The fact that our nation is a global leader in energy production seems lost on the President and his Administration who’s doing everything to stop that from happening. This hurts American jobs and American energy independence and must stop.”

Title: Lee, Graves, Rubio Introduce Major Highway Funding Reform Bill
Date: November 14, 2013

Content:
Washington, D.C. –
Today, U.S. Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA-14) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Transportation Empowerment Act, a bill to open up America’s transportation system to greater local control, better targeted projects, and a more efficient way to maintain and improve the nation’s infrastructure. The bill allows states to respond to the needs of their communities and develop systems that result in less traffic, shorter commutes, more affordable homes, and help families better manage the work-life balance.
"Under the Transportation Empowerment Act, Americans would no longer have to send significant gas-tax revenue to Washington, where sticky-fingered politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists take their cut before sending it back with strings attached,” said Sen. Lee. "Instead, states and cities could plan, finance, and build better-designed and more affordable projects. Local communities should finally have the flexibility to develop the kind of transportation system they want, for less money, without politicians and special interests from other parts of the country telling them how, when, what, and where they should build. For the country as a whole, our plan would mean a better infrastructure system, new jobs and opportunities, diverse localism, and innovative environmental protection. And for working families, it could mean more access to quality, affordable homes, less time on the road – and making it home in time for dinner with the kids.”
“People want to spend less time in traffic and more time enjoying life,” said Rep. Graves, who is introducing the TEA Act in the House for the second time. “Our bill will streamline the highway program, allowing more projects to be completed at a lower cost. This means commuters can move more easily between home and work, freeing up important family time and cutting out hours of frustration behind the wheel.”
“We must empower states to develop the transportation systems they need and remove roadblocks created by Washington, which is why I have joined Senator Lee in introducing this legislation,” said Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). “Donor states like Florida should be getting a better return on our investment, and the Transportation Empowerment Act will do just that.”
The House version sponsored by Rep. Graves currently has 19 cosponsors.
Legislation details:
Transportation Empowerment Act
How it Works
Transfers almost all authority over federal highway and transit programs to the states over a five-year period.
Lowers the federal gas tax to 3.7 cents from 18.4 cents over the same time period.
During the five-year phase out, states will receive block grants that come with vastly fewer federal strings attached.
What It Does
Immediately reduces the bureaucratic burden involved in the construction of critical transportation projects.
Results in a faster administrative response to the transportation problems Americans face, such as traffic, commuting, and access.
Gives states greater flexibility in their tax structure.
Connects where people want to work with where they want to live.
Opens opportunities to develop new mass-transit solutions, innovate environmental protections, and improve the financing of projects.
Creates jobs and grows the economy.
Why The Current System Hurts The Commute
When the costs of federal red tape and Highway Trust Fund redistribution are taken into account, 37 states, including Georgia and Utah, have a rate of return below 100%.  For example, Georgia’s estimated buying power in Fiscal Year 2014 is anticipated to be approximately 84% based on the most recent Highway Trust Fund payment information available, costing Georgia taxpayers $185 million.
For Fiscal Year 2014, $820 million was
authorized
nationwide for so-called “transportation alternatives” described by the Federal Highway Administration as “landscaping and scenic enhancement” and “recreational enhancement,” among others.

Title: Lee Outlines Conservative Anti-Poverty Agenda
Date: November 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee outlined a conservative anti-poverty agenda to address the growing opportunity crisis in America.  His speech, at a forum sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, detailed the causes of social immobility among the working and middle class and charted several reforms that clear a path to help individuals and families stuck in poverty.
“Nineteen-sixty-four wasn’t the year Americans started fighting poverty; it was the year we started losing that fight,” said Sen. Lee. “To start winning again, conservatives are going to have to lead the way - not simply by offering criticism, but alternatives. Our job is to identify the obstructions that impede Americans’ access to our market economy and civil society and clear them.”
Lee previewed several pieces of legislation, some with bipartisan support, that could be part of a conservative anti-poverty agenda, such as changing the current incentive structure to today’s welfare programs, increasing flexibility for states in Medicaid and Head Start, expanding access to higher education through accreditation reform, as well as improving our criminal justice and prison systems.
“What makes America exceptional – and life worth living - is not simply individual freedom, but the heroic, empowering communities that free individuals form… Organic communities formed within the free market and civil society’s networks of opportunity are not threats that poor families need more protection from. They are blessings that poor families need more access to,” said Lee.
“Properly considered, then, the war on poverty is not so much about lifting people up. It’s about bringing people in. And so the challenge to conservatives today is to rethink the war on poverty along these lines, to bring into our economy and society the individuals, families, and communities that have for five decades been unfairly locked out.”

Title: Lee Introduces Comp-Time Bill to Help Working Families
Date: October 31, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a bill to help workers handle the constant challenge of work-life balance by allowing all individuals who work overtime to choose between monetary compensation or comp-time. The “Working Family Flexibility Act” would free workers to choose the best way to alleviate the difficulties of juggling work, home, kids, and community.  Sen. Lee’s bill is a companion to legislation first introduced by Rep. Martha Roby (AL) in the House.
“For many families, especially with young children, their most precious commodity is time,” said Sen. Lee. “But today, federal labor laws restrict the way moms and dads and everyone else can use their time. For decades, Congress has given a special exemption from these laws to government employees. This is unacceptable. The same work-life options available to government employees should be available to private-sector workers, as well.”
“I am excited about the Working Families Flexibility Act gaining traction in the Senate, and I appreciate Sen. Mike Lee stepping forward to introduce a companion bill,” said Rep. Roby. “Talk to any working mom and dad and they’ll tell you they need more time – just one more hour in the day to make life work.  We can’t legislate another hour in the day, but we can help working people better balance the demands of family and work by removing an unnecessary federal restriction on utilizing comp time in the private sector.”
Rep. Roby’s “Working Families Flexibility Act”, H.R. 1406, passed the House of Representatives in May. Sen. Lee’s bill is cosponsored by Sens. Coburn, Cruz, Hatch, Johnson, Paul, Risch, Roberts, and Rubio.
More Information:
How It Works
Gives employers the ability to offer their employees the option of comp time or overtime pay, both accrued at 1½ times the overtime hours worked.
Requires employers who decide to offer this option to their employees to establish a written agreement with the employee outlining the options and to allow each employee to voluntarily choose the option that best fits his needs.
Requires that comp time agreements be included in the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the union and the employer for any employee represented by a union.
Allows employees who choose to accrue comp time to accrue up to 160 hours each year.
Allows employees to “cash out” their accrued comp time at the traditional overtime pay rate at any time throughout the year.
Maintains all existing employee protections, including the current 40-hour workweek and overtime accrual, and provides additional safeguards to ensure that the choice to use comp time is voluntary.
Requires employers to pay employees at the traditional overtime rate for any unused comp time at the end of each calendar year.
What It Does
Ends the unfair discrimination against private-sector employees
Enables parents to better balance work and family obligations
Frees all workers to choose which commodity – time or money – is the more important resource at a given time
Lessens the burden of unnecessary federal regulation

Title: Lee Introduces Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan
Date: October 30, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today Senator Mike Lee introduced a tax reform plan that would replace much of today’s complex tax system with a new, simple structure that provides solutions for America’s ongoing opportunity crisis and ends the discrimination of parents in the tax code.  The Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act is a pro-family, pro-growth plan that incentivizes social mobility, promotes middle-class economic security, and improves opportunity for all Americans.
“If there is any single group of people in the entire country whose equal opportunity to pursue happiness we should make sure to protect, it is our ultimate entrepreneurial and investor class: America’s moms and dads,” said Sen. Lee. “The family has emerged as perhaps the most important institution in our economy.  It is an incubator of economic opportunity, an indicator of economic success, and grows more economically important every day.”
“The current tax code singles out parents of young children for unfair and extremely expensive discrimination. It is what I call the ‘parent tax penalty,’ a glitch in the federal tax code that forces parents to contribute to senior entitlement programs not once, but twice.  My plan levels the playing field to treat all taxpayers more equally. For a middle-class family, this is an immediate, potentially life-changing reform.”
Under this plan, a married couple with two children making the median national income of $51,000 would see a tax cut of approximately $5,000 per year.
“In short, the Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act would restore opportunities to working parents and their children to pursue happiness that right now federal policy unfairly denies them,” Lee added.
Praise for Senator Lee’s Tax Reform Proposal
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush:
“Senator Mike Lee and others here are proposing incredibly sound policies to provide incentives for child rearing families to give them the kind of support that they need through our tax code.”
National Review Editorial Board:
“Senator Mike Lee, the Utah conservative, announced an ambitious plan to reform taxes — much the most attractive one we have heard from any Republican for a long time.”
Reihan Salam:
“[The Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act] represents genuinely new thinking about how Republicans ought to approach domestic policy… [I]t will represent a substantial tax cut for middle-income families with children”.
Josh Barro:
“Lee is out with a new tax plan that's much better and actually addresses the needs of the middle class.”
Ramesh Ponnuru:
“Republican economic rhetoric has tended to overemphasize commercial individualism…That critique has some force. But it has less force now that Lee, who is clearly a conservative, is shifting his party's priorities on taxes toward the middle class.”

Title: Excerpts from Lee’s Speech on a New Conservative Reform Agenda
Date: October 29, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) will give a speech at the Heritage Foundation at 2:30 pm EST on the way forward for conservatives and the need for a new conservative reform agenda.
The following are selected excerpts from the speech:
“The ideas that defined and propelled the Reagan Revolution did not come down from a mountain etched in stone tablets. They were forged in an open, roiling, diverse debate about how conservatism could truly meet the challenges of that day. That debate invited all conservatives and as we know, elevated the best… Together, that generation of conservatives transformed a movement that was anti-statist, anti-communist, and anti-establishment, and made it pro-reform. Contrary to the establishment’s complaints, conservatives in the late 1970s did not start a “civil war.” They started a (mostly) civil debate. Because of that confident and deeply conservative choice – to argue rather than quarrel, to persuade rather than simply purge - the vanguards of the establishment never knew what hit them.  The bottom line was that in 1976, the conservative movement found a leader for the ages, yet it still failed.  By 1980, the movement had forged an agenda for its time and only then did it succeed.”
…
“It’s time for another Great Debate, and we should welcome all input. Grassroots and establishment. Conservatives and moderates. Libertarians and traditionalists. Interventionists and non-interventionists. Economic conservatives and social conservatives. All are part of our movement, and all are vital to our success – so all should be welcome in this debate. There are still nearly three years before Republicans will have a chance to select a new, unifying conservative leader. But together we can start debating and developing a new, unifying conservative agenda right now.”
…
“I submit that the great challenge of our generation is America’s growing crisis of stagnation and sclerosis  - a crisis that comes down to a shortage of opportunities.  This opportunity crisis presents itself in three principal ways: immobility among the poor, trapped in poverty; insecurity in the middle class, where families just can’t seem to get ahead; and cronyist privilege at the top, where political and economic elites unfairly profit at everyone else’s expense. The Republican Party should tackle these three crises head on.”
…
“To do my part, today I want to talk about four pieces of legislation specifically designed to address four leading challenges facing middle-class families today: the cost of raising children, the difficulties of work-life balance, the time Americans lose away from work and home, stuck in traffic, and the rising costs of and restricted access to quality higher education. These bills won’t solve every problem under the sun. Raising a family isn’t supposed to be easy. But each would restore to working families more of the freedom they deserve to pursue their happiness: to earn a good living and build a good life.”
…
“Especially in the wake of recent controversies, many conservatives are more frustrated with the establishment than ever before. And we have every reason to be.  But however justified, frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda. And outrage, as a habit, is not even conservative. Outrage, resentment, and intolerance are gargoyles of the Left. For us, optimism is not just a message – it’s a principle. American conservatism, at its core, is about gratitude, and cooperation, and trust, and above all hope. It is also about inclusion. Successful political movements are about identifying converts, not heretics. This, too, is part of the challenge before us.”

Title: Lee Speaks on CR, Debt Limit, ObamaCare Funding Vote
Date: October 16, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered remarks on the upcoming CR, debt limit, and ObamaCare funding vote. The full text is available below.
Mr. President,
Here we are again.
Another unnecessary crisis. A proposal that maintains the status quo.  Very little time to read and evaluate the bill.  No time to explain it to our constituents.
This is Washington.  It is exactly the kind of thing the American people are fed up with and exactly why several of my colleagues and I began this effort to defund and delay Obamacare back in July.
It appears that this particular fight will end much the same way Obamacare began: in a last-minute deal, negotiated in back rooms, then forced on Congress and the American people.
The Washington Establishment can’t bring itself to believe that this is why Congress has a poor approval rating – because Washington doesn’t listen to the American people.  It ignores them.  And when the American people can no longer be ignored, the administration shuts down national parks, blocks veterans from going to their own memorials, uses the IRS to target certain groups, and holds hostage critical funding for cancer research, low-income women and children, veterans’ health benefits, border security, and our National Guard.
It is shameful how Washington treats the American people and the people are right to be upset about it.
The media keeps asking, was it worth it?  My answer is that it is always worth it to do the right thing.  Fighting against an abusive government in defense of protecting our individual rights and freedoms is always the right thing.
Some say we shouldn’t have fought because we couldn’t win.  But this country wasn’t built by fighting only when victory was certain.  In fact, some of the most important victories in our history were the result of fighting battles against significant odds.
And even if victory seemed difficult or impossible, that wouldn’t excuse me or anyone else from doing the right thing.  Avoiding difficult battles is how we ended up in this mess – $17 trillion in debt, out-of-control spending, a broken entitlement system, a tax code no one understands – all because Washington is willing to act only when there is guaranteed political gain.
When the avoidance of political risk becomes our dominant motivation, only the Washington establishment wins.  And the American people lose.
Furthermore, in Washington, victories are rarely immediate and very few are permanent.  Obamacare wasn’t enacted overnight and it won’t be repealed overnight.  We must remind the American people of the harmful effects of this law at every opportunity if we are ever going to see it repealed.
The best case against Obamacare is proving to be Obamacare itself.
We have repeatedly warned that the American people will be shocked when they realize the way the president has misled them about Obamacare.
The embarrassing rollout of the exchanges doesn’t even scratch the surface. Every day brings a new story of a family whose deductible has doubled, or a married couple that can’t keep the plan they have, or a business that can no longer provide insurance, or workers who are seeing their hours cut or losing their jobs altogether.
The realization that the administration has either been dishonest or incompetent – or both – is just starting to dawn on the American people.  Even the president’s friends in the media are watching this slow rolling train wreck and are demanding the president do something to stop it.
The Chicago Tribune, the president’s hometown newspaper, puts it this way:
“Last spring, President Barack Obama said ‘there will still be, you know, glitches and bumps’ in the rollout of the new system. But what we're seeing now is no glitch or bump. There is a growing mountain of evidence that
Obamacare has fundamental problems in design and implementation
.”
The Tribune goes on to say: “We encouraged a one-year delay in the law. We recognize that's not going to happen. Obamacare is here. It's time, though, for the Obama administration to level with Americans about what's happening here. It's time to stop blaming Republicans and start talking about what needs to change.”
Incidentally, a delay in the law for the duration of the CR is exactly what we called for back in July. And now it appears that the president’s hometown newspaper agrees with us.
Almost everyone but the president seems to recognize that this law is going to be terrible for the American people.  It’s costing jobs. It’s hurting families. It’s making people’s health care situation worse and it won’t solve the problems in our broken health care system.
And let me be clear: There will be very real consequences for people in both parties as a result of the implementation of this law.
Today, Washington has the upper hand, but the American people will always have the last word.
This is not over.  We have an obligation to fight for the American people. And I do not intend to let the people down.

Title: Lee’s Full Remarks at the Values Voters Summit
Date: October 11, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee told the audience at the Values Voters Summit it is time for conservatives and the Republican Party to develop a reform agenda and to once again become the party of big ideas.
“For too long, Republicans have put off the difficult work of developing a modernized, principled conservative reform agenda to meet many of the new challenges of the 21
st
century.  There are many reasons why this is so. But I think the biggest is that in this city, conservatives often fall into a trap – defining ourselves by what we are against: Big government, debt, higher taxes and regulations, Obamacare. But we haven’t invested nearly as much time and energy in communicating what we conservatives are for.  I’m talking about more than simply the
policies
we advocate. Conservatism is not about the bills we want to pass, but the nation we want to be.”
Last month, Senator Lee announced a tax reform plan that replaces today’s complex tax system with a new, simple structure that provides solutions for America’s ongoing opportunity crisis.  The “Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act” incentivizes social mobility, promotes middle-class economic security, and improves opportunity for all Americans.

“The real goal - what conservatives are really for - is not an agenda for government. It’s a vision of society. A view of the world we want to build, together. “Together.” That word, “together,” is an essential – and too often overlooked – part of what we conservatives believe.  We’re all committed to bedrock principles of individual liberty, individual rights, and personal responsibility.  But the reason we fight for
individual freedom
is the strength, vitality, and value of the communities free individuals form.
“The alternative to big government is not small government.  The alternative to big government is a thriving, flourishing nation of cooperative communities – where your success depends on your service. It’s a free enterprise economy where everyone works for everyone else, competing to see who can figure out the best way to help the most people.  And it’s a voluntary civil society, where free individuals come together to meet each other’s needs, fill in the gaps, and make sure no one gets left behind.”

Title: Lee: President Abusing His Power Against the American People
Date: October 7, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) responded to the president’s bullying of the American people and said it exposed all the reasons why Congress must fight against the massive expansion of government in to Americans’ health care choices:
“The Obama Administration’s behavior during the first week of the shutdown has been the best argument against Obamacare anyone has ever made,” said Senator Lee.
“The American people do not want Obamacare, and they are demanding that Washington act to protect them from the harmful effects of this unfortunate law.  The president’s response has been to ignore them, allow the government to shutdown, and then use his power to close national parks and monuments, stop paying veterans’ benefits, and cut off cancer research.
“This is exactly why we should not expand the government’s power over our health care choices.  What power the government has, it will use – and misuse – to advance its own interests, even if that means punishing the American people along the way.
“The message behind the Administration’s shutdown bullying is the same message sent by his IRS’s abuses of political opponents: do what I say, or else. This is the abusive, partisan, unaccountable bureaucracy that, under Obamacare, will soon be running America’s health care system.
“President Obama is not just using the vast powers of his office as leverage against Republicans – he is abusing his powers as leverage against the American people.
“The scenes of World War II veterans being shut out of a monument built in their honor should be a bright red flag warning the American people what an out-of-control federal government is capable of.  Each day brings a new and more vivid example of why it is critical that we not allow Washington to reach even further into our most personal and intimate decisions.
“We now see how determined the president is to expand the power of the federal government and his willingness to use that power to harm the country to get what he wants.  Congress cannot allow this to stand and should continue to work to end the shutdown and protect the American people from Obamacare.”

Title: Lee: Why Won’t Democrats Take ‘Yes’ for an Answer on Vet Funding?
Date: October 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee asked for the Senate to pass a bill to fund veterans’ benefits by unanimous consent.  The motion was quickly shot down by Democrats who provided little explanation for their opposition to funding veterans’ benefits.
“There are many things on which Republicans and Democrats do not agree, but whether or not to take care of our veterans should not be among those things,” said Sen. Lee during a floor speech in which he offered one of several Republican bills to keep the government open.
“These bills provide funding for things like veterans' disability benefits, the G.I. Bill and cancer research,” said Lee, referring to legislation being considered in the house. “These bills keep our national parks open and they make sure that our National Guard personnel get paid.”
“The president himself has asked Congress to do this… [W]hy is it that the President of the United States and the Democrats in the Senate are having such a hard time taking "yes" for an answer?”
Read the full transcript below:
Madam president, what we're being told by the majority is that we have to vote for everything in order to fund anything. Now, moments ago I proposed a unanimous consent request that, if approved, would provide for the immediate availability of mandatory funds generally controlled through the annual appropriations process for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I thank the Republican leader for making similar requests earlier and for other Republican colleagues for joining him in that and I look forward to making other similar requests in the coming hours.
Frankly, I'm a little stunned at some of the things that we're hearing from the other side of the aisle. It's difficult for me to understand the objections to bills the House passed last night and the ones that Senate Republicans are trying to pass today.
First, this legislation doesn't fund anything that's controversial. None of the pieces of legislation being worked on and passed by the House right now and last night can be considered controversial. These bills provide funding for things like veterans' disability benefits, the G.I. Bill and cancer research. These bills keep our national parks open and they make sure that our National Guard personnel get paid.
There are many things on which Republicans and Democrats do not agree, but whether or not to take care of our veterans should not be among those things.
Second, the president himself has asked Congress to do this. I'll remind my friends exactly what he said just a few days ago, speaking to what might happen during a government shutdown. He said:
"Office buildings would close, paychecks would be delayed, vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung. Veterans, who've sacrificed for their country, will find their support centers unstaffed. Tourists will find every one of America's national parks and monuments, from Yosemite to the Smithsonian to the Statue of Liberty immediately closed. And, of course, the communities and small businesses that rely on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out of customers and out of luck."
Now, the Republicans in the House of Representatives took the president of the United States at his word and started immediately to draft bills to make sure that these priorities receive funding. In response, Senate Democrats have said that this plan to fund things like veterans, national parks and others was fundamentally unserious. They said Republicans were playing games. And the biggest head scratcher of them all, the president issued a veto threat for bills that fund the very things that he said he wanted to fund, that he would like Congress to fund.
And so it makes me wonder, why is it that the President of the United States and the Democrats in the Senate are having such a hard time taking "yes" for an answer? The fundamental objection, as I understand it, has been that because these bills passed by the House of Representatives last night and those being passed today, within the next couple of hours, because those bills don't fund everything, they're objectionable. In other words, we have to fund everything or we may fund nothing.
I have to remind my colleagues that normally, under regular order of appropriations, Congress will vote on and ultimately approve a dozen or so separate segmented appropriations measures, making sure that we address each area within our federal government separately so that there's adequate time to consider what it is that we're spending money on.
This is a big government, one that spends between $3.5 and $4 trillion a year. And it's important that we break this up in pieces. But over the last 4 1/2 years or so, we've been operating on the basis of back-to-back continuing resolutions, measures that basically require us to fund everything or fund nothing.
And so what this proposal does, what the Republicans in the House of Representatives are quite wisely doing is saying, let's start with those areas as to which there is the most broad-based bipartisan consensus and let's keep government funded at current levels, as a continuing resolution would do within those areas and let's build consensus and let's start funding the government in those areas where there isn't significant objection.
What I don't hear from my colleagues is a substantive objection to what it does fund. What I hear is what they're objecting to is what it doesn't fund. So let's pass those things that we can agree should be funded and let's move forward. And I think we can get most of this resolved fairly quickly.
Two of the bills in the House of Representatives that have been passed in this fashion have quite significantly received substantial bipartisan support and I expect that the rest of them will receive bipartisan support as well. In the middle of an unfortunate government shutdown surrounded by all this divisive rhetoric, Republicans and Democrats came together in the House overwhelmingly to approve these bills. I think we owe it to the country to show that we can do the same thing in the Senate, acting upon the advice of our better angels and acting in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation to keep our government funded.
Fourth, this is a path forward that was first introduced by none other than the distinguished Majority Leader himself. On Monday afternoon, Senator Harry Reid from Nevada, the Senate Majority Leader, asked for unanimous consent to pass a bill that ensured our active-duty military would be paid in the event a shutdown. And in a matter of minutes, it was done.
So I ask my friends across the aisle: Was Senator Reid playing games? Was that unserious? Just Monday, just a few days ago we passed something that didn't fund everything but it did fund something, it funded the government to the extent necessary to allow us to continue paying our active-duty military personnel. So was that unserious?
Of course not. So why is it unserious when we try to fund veterans disability payments or cancer research or our National Guard? Why is it all of a sudden playing games to try to keep our national parks open? What exactly has changed since Monday? Why can we come together to pass a bill funding military pay but not to fund veterans' benefits?
And finally, none of these bills has any connection to the implementation of Obamacare. I understand that my friends across the aisle support that law, despite its numerous failings and indications that it's harming the American people and the economy, that it's hurting jobs and threatening the affordability of health insurance.
I understand that some of my friends across the aisle want to protect that law. And we're going to continue to have that debate about that law. Especially in light of all the problems people are having with signing up with the exchanges, not to mention the ongoing problems of job losses, wage reductions, hours lost and people losing their health coverage because of Obamacare. Especially in light of all those problems, we should continue having that debate, but that debate isn't essential to every aspect of our government's funding.
Let me be clear: We will do everything in our power to protect the American people from the harmful effects of Obamacare. That fight will most certainly continue. And my friends across the aisle are welcome to join that debate, as I'm sure they will.
But none of these bills, none of the bills that we're considering today relates in any way to the implementation of Obamacare. For this moment, at the very least, we should focus on keeping our promise to the people who have sacrificed the most to keep this country free.
I applaud the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. I applaud the Republicans and the Democrats who have supported legislation to help keep our government funded in these critical areas. We can come together if we pursue a step-by-step process for funding our government. This more closely resembles the way we should have been appropriating in the first place. This is the best way forward. It's the way to help minimize the pain Americans are experiencing as a result of this unfortunate shutdown.
Thank you, madam president.

Title: ICYMI: Lee Discusses Plan to Avoid Prolonged Government Shutdown
Date: October 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Greta Van Susteren yesterday that Congress should avoid a prolonged
government shutdown
by passing a series of smaller funding bills.
“Earlier today we saw in the Senate republicans and democrats coming together unanimously approving pay for full time active duty military personnel,” said Senator Lee. “We did that unanimously. And I think that can be a model for us making sure that a government shutdown doesn't occur in various areas of the government—the majority of areas of government—where there is not a whole lot of controversy. I’m working on a bill right now that would keep us funded with respect to other areas of the Department of Defense and Veterans affairs, for example. Now, keep us funded with respect to other areas and veterans affairs, for example. We need to keep our border control and our TSA going. My bill would do that—I’m working on that bill right now, I’ve got staff up late working on that. I think that’s another area where we can get these things funded so we can soften any impact to the shut down and avoid a shut down altogether in many areas of the government. “
The full transcript is available below:
Greta: Senator, tell me what do you think is going happen? The house republicans going to negotiate a little bit? Do you expect the senate democrats to give a little bit?
Lee: Republicans have negotiated and have moved substantially. We've seen no movement whatever from democrats in the senate and from the White House. Americans demand more and deserve more, but I'll tell you there is one area that should give us comfort and encouragement. Earlier today we saw in the senate republicans and democrats coming together unanimously approving pay for full time active duty military personnel. We did that unanimously. And I think that can be a model for us making sure that a government shutdown doesn't occur in various areas of the government—the majority of areas of government—where there is not a whole lot of controversy. I’m working on a bill right now that would keep us funded with respect to other areas of the Department of Defense and Veterans affairs, for example. Now, keep us funded with respect to other areas and veterans affairs, for example. We need to keep our border control and our TSA going. My bill would do that—I’m working on that bill right now, I’ve got staff up late working on that. I think that’s another area where we can get these things funded so we can soften any impact to the shut down and avoid a shut down altogether in many areas of the government.
Greta: Is the only dispute—is the main area of dispute…is the real issue what Republicans don't want to fund ObamaCare is that the issue that’s stopping us?
Lee: Yes, that is the issue. Republicans don't want to fund ObamaCare. This is a law the president is not following.  This is a law that the president has said himself isn't ready to be implemented. This is a law that has been described by its own sponsor as a train wreck. It's causing millions of Americans to lose jobs we're not willing to fund it. We are, however, willing to fund active duty military pay, we’re willing to fund the Department of Defense, we’re willing to fund Homeland Security. But we’re not willing to fund ObamaCare.
Greta:  If the president said – and this is hypothetically – will you fund the original Obamacare without all the carve outs, exemptions, or waivers, would that make a difference to you or not?
Lee:  You know, it might well.  And it's interesting to point out Greta that if we were dealing with that – if that is all we'd been dealing with – this idea would never have gotten momentum in July.  What caused me to kickstart this movement and start suggesting to my colleagues and my counterparts in the House back in July that we defund Obamacare was the president's decision that he would not follow the law – his own announcement that the law wasn't ready to implement.  Our reaction was that if the president isn't willing to follow this law, then we shouldn't fund it's implementation.
Greta:  I suspect that you have a lot of contacts in the House.  What do you think the speaker is thinking tonight?  How does he resolve this from the House side?
Lee:  You know, it's difficult.  He's in a difficult spot.  He's moved a number of compromise efforts, and those have been rejected flatly by the Senate each time with only minimum debate and discussion.  Again, I think it is important to recognize where we have made progress with something the House passed late Saturday night relative to active duty military pay.  We passed that by unanimous consent today.  This provides a model when we couple it with what the president said just hours ago.  He said he's concerned about Border Patrol – he's concerned about these other areas where there isn't much controversy.  We can pass other bills, keeping government funded in these areas and we can do it just fine without funding Obamacare.  These areas have nothing to do with Obamacare.
Greta:  The president says that Obamacare is the saw.  The Supreme Court upheld it as constitutional, and it's the job of Congress to fund the law.  So what does he do to get a law funded that he says is the law of the land?  What does he do about that?
Lee:  I love this argument, because it frames our argument perfectly.  If ObamaCare is the law, if that is the argument, then it undercuts them.  Because he's not following the law.  He's not willing to follow ObamaCare as written, and he has rewritten it three to four times depending on which count you take.  As he continues to depart from the law, that undercuts his argument that we ought to just follow the law.  He's not willing to do that.
Greta: Going back to my earlier question.  Would you be fine with going back to the originally signed ObamaCare without all the exemptions, and changes, and waivers, and everything else?  You don't like it.  I understand that point, but that would be your responsibility at that point to fund that law?
Lee:  I don't know that we can go back.  What I'm saying is that had that been all we were dealing with, had he never opened this door in July, I don't think the defund ObamaCare movement would have taken off.  I don't think dontfundit.com would have gotten two million signatures in just a few weeks, because Americans would never have looked at this and seen the hypocrisy of a president saying, "I'm forcing this law on you – a law that you never wanted, and a law I'm not willing to follow."  That's the reason this has taken off like it has.  Because the president isn't willing to follow his own law.

Title: Lee Statement Regarding Judiciary Committee Hearing On Government Surveillance
Date: October 2, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement regarding today’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled “Continued Oversight of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.”
“Today’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the federal government’s use of its surveillance authorities highlighted many of the concerns I have expressed with respect to the scope and breadth of government collection of information on Americans,” Senator Lee said.  “The Fourth Amendment’s protection against ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ is designed to prevent against precisely the kind of suspicionless fishing expeditions that the government is currently carrying out under its telephony metadata collection program.  Only by narrowing the statutory authorities the government purports to justify this highly intrusive surveillance of innocent Americans can we restore the proper constitutional balance.
“We must also increase the transparency with which the nation’s surveillance programs operate.  Unless we take steps to restore credibility and public confidence in these programs, we risk not only violating individual privacy, but also harming the competitiveness of important economic interests in the technology and telecommunications industries, including many Utah based companies, that rely on public trust.  I believe more information about how these programs operate can be made public without endangering national security.”
“I have worked in the past with Chairman Leahy and other colleagues to introduce important legislation on these topics.  I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Leahy to introduce legislation to narrow controversial surveillance authorities, enhance government oversight of surveillance programs, and increase transparency.”

Title: Lee: End Government Shutdown with Noncontroversial Spending Bills
Date: October 1, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee called for an end to the
government shutdown
by passing smaller, noncontroversial funding bills for government agencies that are not related to the implementation of Obamacare.
“One positive and encouraging step was taken yesterday in response to action taken by the House of Representatives late Saturday night,” said Senator Lee moments ago on the Senate floor.  “Late Saturday night, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ensure that all active duty military personnel, the brave men and women in uniform, will continue to get paid. Yesterday, the Senate took up that measure and passed it unanimously. It did so in a matter of minutes, in a seemingly effortless legislative act.
“I think we can do the exact same thing with a number of noncontroversial spending bills that fund aspects of government that Americans overwhelmingly support, Americans acknowledge that we need, and that are completely unrelated to Obamacare.
“My plan, in other words, would involve setting up segmented continuing resolutions, appropriations measures that would keep the funding going at current levels to various areas within government, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, military construction, C.J.S., which includes funding for the Department of Justice, the federal court system, the F.B.I., NASA, and the national weather service, for example.”
“We can act. We should act. We must act today to resolve this. There is absolutely no reason why this noncontroversial aspect of our federal government's operation should continue one more day or even one more hour, for that matter, without being funded,” he added.
Read the full transcript below:
Mr. Lee: Mr. President, yesterday when the president of the United States addressed the American people, he was very clear about what a shutdown would mean. He said "office buildings would close, paychecks would be delayed, vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, businesses and our economy depend on would hamstrung, business owners would see delays in raising capital, seeking infrastructure permits or rebuilding after hurricane Sandy. Tourists will find every one of America’s national parks and monuments from Yosemite to the Smithsonian to the statue of liberty closed and of course the communities and small businesses that rely on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out of customers and out of luck.
These were the President's concerns about, well, what will happen to the American people, about real people as one of my colleagues put it yesterday during and in connection with a government shutdown. I think it's also important that we continue to focus as well on those who are already hurting, hurting for reasons that don't have to do with the shutdown.
And so I'd like to turn for a moment to people who are and for a number of months have been already feeling the negative effects of another government policy that the president and his allies in congress staunchly defend.
Obamacare happens to be the number-one job killer in the country. A recent analysis documented hundreds of businesses that are cutting back hours to avoid the crushing costs of Obamacare's severe mandates. As a result, major unions have said that Obamacare could destroy the 40-hour workweek, the backbone of the American economy.
People are losing their health insurance. Just a week ago Friday 20,000 people, employees of Home Depot, were informed that they would be losing their health insurance. U.P.S. is no longer going to provide health insurance for spouses of employees. And the grocery store chain Trader Joe's dropped health care coverage for part-time employees.
The change hopefully will be temporary for the shutdown, days, maybe a few hours if the democrats decide to negotiate. For everyone who lost their jobs, their hours cut, wages reduced or who no longer receive health insurance, the change could prove to be far more permanent. Do we not have an obligation to do something for those people? I think we do.
So let's look for the path forward. Let's return to the president's concern about those who are hurt by a government shutdown. One positive and encouraging step was taken yesterday, yesterday in response to action taken by the House of Representatives late Saturday night. Late Saturday night the House of Representatives passed a bill to ensure that all active duty military personnel, the brave men and women in uniform will continue to get paid. Yesterday the senate took up that measure and passed it unanimously. It did so in a matter of minutes. In a seemingly effortless legislative act.
I think we can do the exact same thing with a number of noncontroversial spending bills that fund aspects of government that Americans overwhelmingly support, Americans acknowledge that we need, and that are completely unrelated to Obamacare.
My plan, in other words, would involve setting up segmented continuing resolutions, appropriations measures that would keep the funding going at current levels to various areas within government, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, military construction, C.J.S., which includes funding for the Department of Justice, the federal court system, the F.B.I., NASA, and the national weather service, for example.
And also the U.S. Department of the Interior, which includes our national parks. I mention national parks here with special interest, because today, the first day of what we hope will be a short, quickly resolved government shutdown, we've got at least two honor flights coming in from around the country bringing world war ii veterans, members of the greatest generation, to Washington, D.C. who plan to visit the World War II veterans memorial, a memorial designed specifically for them. When they arrive, if nothing changes between now and then, they'll painfully discover what we've learned this morning, which is that those parts of the national mall have been fenced off and barricaded. They won't be able to get in. They won't be able to get very close. This is unfortunate, and just as important, it is unnecessary.
We can act. We should act. We must act today to resolve this. There is absolutely no reason  why this noncontroversial aspect of our federal government's operation should continue one more day or even one more hour, for that matter, without being funded.
This is an effort to compromise, an effort that is badly needed, an effort that comes in the wake of other efforts to compromise that have for the most part failed. The House of Representatives has tried now three different times to avoid a shutdown, passing three different measures to make sure that our government would continue to be funded.
Senator Reid and those members of his conference, those who support him have rejected all three plans, rejected all three offers to keep the government funding, accusing republicans of playing games with Obamacare. So in light of that, let's leave Obamacare for another day and not hold the vast majority of government functions hostage when the vast majority of government functions don't have anything to do with the implementation and enforcement of Obamacare.
We did it yesterday. We did it and it worked well. It was seamless. It was done with absolute unanimous consent. We did it with respect to active duty military pay yesterday. We can do it for veterans benefits, for border security, for national parks and many, many other government agencies. We can keep government open. We can keep those aspects of our federal government funded. We can do so. We should do so. Together we will do so.
And I look forward to having these discussions in the coming hours to make sure that we can continue to work together as colleagues. We may not agree on everything, but in those areas where we should agree and where we in reality do agree, let's keep the government funded. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: Lee: Senate Should Pass Military Pay Bill Immediately
Date: September 30, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee said the Senate should pass the House bill that guarantees active duty military members will get paid in the event of a government shutdown.
“Senator Reid shouldn’t be allowed to negotiate by threatening to withhold payments to our military members.  The current fight in Washington is about whether or not Congress will act to protect the American people from Obamacare.  Our differences on that issue should not put at risk payments to our military.  They should be fully funded immediately.”
The House passed the military pay bill unanimously on Saturday night.  Instead of reconvening the Senate on Sunday as some had called for, Senator Reid chose to wait until Monday afternoon to call the Senate back into session, increasing the possibility that the fight over Obamacare could put military pay in jeopardy.

Title: Lee: GOP Has the Votes to Stop Funding Obamacare
Date: September 26, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee explained that Senate Republicans have the votes to prevent Sen. Harry Reid from reinstating funding for Obamacare in the House continuing resolution if they will stay unified.  Republicans only need 41 votes to block Reid from using procedural tricks to put Obamacare funding back in the bill.
“House Republicans showed tremendous courage and unity in voting to fund government, avoid a shut down, and protect the American people from the harmful effects of Obamacare,” said Sen. Lee.  “Senate Republicans have the ability to show that same courage by staying unified and together opposing cloture on the final bill.  We should continue to withhold support for ending debate until Senator Reid either brings up the House bill as is for an up-or-down vote, or allows an open amendment process that permits both Republicans and Democrats to offer amendments to the bill.”
Opposing cloture to end debate is one of the few tools the minority has in the Senate to prevent the majority from imposing its partisan will on the American people or using procedural tricks to limit the minority’s rights.  Republicans have defended their rights against Sen. Harry Reid’s procedural tricks several times in the past.  For example, in 2011, Republicans used 44 votes to block ending debate on the Small Business Innovation Research Act, and 51 votes to prevent ending debate on the Public Works and Economic Development Reauthorization Act (4 Democrats voted with a united Republican caucus).  In 2012, Republicans gathered 42 votes to oppose ending debate on the Highway Bill.
Reid is again using procedural tricks – known as “filling the tree” – on the House CR to prevent Republican amendments and shove through a process that will gut the House-passed bill.  Republicans voting “YES” on cloture will likely find themselves aligned with a united Democratic caucus on a procedural vote that would allow Sen. Reid to gut the House bill and fund Obamacare.
“Republicans should stand up for their rights as a minority and for the American people as a whole. We have the votes to win, if only Senate Republicans will stand together as the House did and as we have in the past,” Sen. Lee added.
The vote on cloture to end debate is expected on Friday, but could be held as early as Thursday evening.

Title: Lee Applauds Unified House Vote to Fund Government, Defund Obamacare
Date: September 20, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Following the passage of the House spending bill, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement:
“Today is a victory for the American people. A unified House Republican Caucus has sent a strong message: keep the government open and protect the country from the harmful effects of Obamacare.
“The fight now turns to the Senate where we have an equal obligation to do the right thing for the American people.  How many more people have to lose their jobs, wages, and health care benefits before Congress acts?  How many more states have to announce that premiums are going up before we do something to protect the country?  We should not, and will not, allow Senate Democratic leaders to ignore the will of the American people.
“The American people never supported Obamacare – and they still don't. If the American people make their voices heard now and start contacting Senate Democrats, I truly believe that, along with a unified Senate Republicans Caucus, we will convince enough Democrats to finally do the right thing for the country.”

Title: Lee, Cruz, Rubio Praise House Bill to Keep Government Open, Defund Obamacare
Date: September 18, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (UT), Ted Cruz (TX) and Marco Rubio (FL) praised House Republicans for proposing a spending bill that funds the federal government, prevents a government shut down, and permanently defunds Obamacare:
“Today’s announcement by Speaker Boehner is a victory for the American people,” said Sen. Lee. “For months, Americans have been telling Washington to fund the operations of government but also protect them from the harmful effects and unfair implementation of Obamacare.  The spending proposal the Speaker put forth today shows that if the American people are united, Washington does listen.  We encourage the House to approve this legislation quickly and I applaud Speaker Boehner for his leadership on this proposal.  Then it will be up to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass this measure to fund government and defund Obamacare.”
“Today's announcement that the House will vote to defund Obamacare is terrific news,” said Sen. Cruz. “Just a few weeks ago, this was deemed impossible.  We commend House leadership and House Republicans for listening to the people and for taking decisive action to stop Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America. Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so.  At that point, House Republicans must stand firm, hold their ground, and continue to listen to the American people. President Obama has already granted Obamacare exemptions to big corporations and Members of Congress; he should not threaten to shut down the government just to deny those same exemptions to hard-working American families."
“The American people have made clear they want Washington to keep the government open but also need protection from Obamacare’s harmful effects,” said Sen. Rubio. “Today’s announcement would accomplish what the American people have been asking of Congress.  A solution is within sight in order to avert another crisis of Washington’s creation. President Obama and his allies in Congress should abandon their threats of shutting down the government and instead work with Republicans to pass this proposal that would keep government open while preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to inflict Obamacare’s damage on people’s jobs, incomes, current health plans and doctor relationships.”

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced a tax reform plan that replaces today’s complex tax system with a new, simple structure that provides solutions for America’s ongoing opportunity crisis.  The “Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act” incentivizes social mobility, promotes middle-class economic security, and improves opportunity for all Americans.
Senator Lee delivered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute today to introduce this plan.  The full remarks as prepared for delivery can be found below:
“Tax Reform, the Family, and the Pursuit of Happiness”
Remarks to the American Enterprise Institute
U.S. Senator Mike Lee
September 17, 2013
Thank you very much, Arthur – both for that kind introduction and for everything you do to advance the cause of human freedom.
And a Happy Constitution Day to you all.
Now, you might think there are few demographic groups more easily stereotyped than middle aged, Mormon, constitutional lawyers.
But let me tell you, every year on September 17
th
, after you get a few 7-Ups into us, all bets are off. Or would be, if any of us gambled.
For on Constitution Day, from the J. Reuben Clark Law School at BYU, to the Utah Supreme Court, to the Provo Chapter of the Federalist Society, we will be partying like it’s 1787.
It is a privilege to be here at the American Enterprise Institute. A.E.I. has been the home of so many distinguished scholars who have influenced
my own
thinking over the years.
And far more importantly, A.E.I. scholars have for decades influenced
everyone’s
thinking, really – by challenging and transforming public policy debates in Washington and around the country. I am here today because I believe the public policy status quo in Washington – and in particular, within the Republican Party – must once again be challenged and transformed.
As Arthur mentioned, the focus of my remarks will be the new tax reform proposal I will soon be introducing in the Senate.
But before I get into the specifics of the legislation, I think it’s important to explain the problem it has been designed to solve.
On this Constitution Day, allow me to begin with thoughts from perhaps the two most important constitutionalists in American history.
The first, from James Madison, is that the “object of government,” is “the happiness of the people.”
The second, from Abraham Lincoln, is that the role of government is:
“…to lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all, to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.”
Taken together, these two insights offer an almost perfect distillation of what America - and the Republican Party,
at its best
- stand for: equal opportunity, for all, to pursue happiness.
Today, this fundamental American ideal is hanging by a thread.
Up and down American society – which used to be defined and driven by what Tocqueville called our “yearning desire to rise” - we find a new and unnatural stagnancy.
We find the underprivileged trapped in poverty, sometimes for generations.
We find the middle class caught on a treadmill, running harder every year just to maintain the economic security and social cohesion that were once taken for granted.
Meanwhile, at the top of our society, we find a political and economic elite that – having reached the highest rungs – has pulled up the ladder behind itself, denying others the chance even to climb.
From Wall Street to K Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, we find special interests increasingly exempted and insulated –
by law -
from the rigors of competition and the consequences of their own mistakes.
All of this points to what really is an inequality crisis in America today – a crisis not of unequal wealth of income… but unequal
opportunity
.
Progressives, from the president on down, say that inequality in America today is a failure of the
free market,
resulting from insufficient government intervention.
But if you look closely, you start to notice, the opposite is true.
Today, many of Lincoln’s
“artificial weights”
and obstacles blocking his “paths of laudable pursuit”
are
themselves
dysfunctional government policies.
It is government policies, after all, that trap poor children in rotten schools; poor families in broken neighborhoods; that penalize single parents for getting raises, or getting married.
It is government policies that inflate costs and limit access to quality schools and health care; that hamstring badly needed innovation in higher education; and penalize parents’ investment in their children.
Much more on that in a moment.
And of course it is government policy that gives preferential treatment and subsidies to well-connected corporations and special interests at the expense of everyone else.
Seen in this light, there is a very good reason why Americans across the political spectrum – from the Tea Party to the Occupy movement - believe our system has become rigged.
Rigged
for
big government, big business, and big special interests. And rigged against the ordinary citizens and forgotten families who work hard, play by the rules, and live within their means.
More and more every day, the system
is
rigged. The market can’t do that. Only government can. And it does.
Government at all levels – but especially in Washington, not coincidentally now home to six of America’s ten wealthiest counties – is in effect redistributing
opportunity
from the poor and middle class… to government itself and its clients and cronies.
This inequality crisis – including government’s role in it and the millions of struggling families it is leaving behind – is the great social and economic challenge facing the United States today.
It is also the great challenge facing the Republican Party.
For it is
our own deepest convictions
about the pursuit of happiness and the very meaning of America that this opportunity crisis subverts.
Without equal opportunity, our free enterprise economy and voluntary civil society - the twin pillars of American exceptionalism – break down.
When government twists the law to benefit the well-connected at the expense of the disconnected, America ceases to be exceptional.
And the Land of Opportunity…
isn’t.
This is not merely a case of sub-optimal policymaking – especially when
Republicans
go along with it.
For the Party of Lincoln to indulge in the politics of privilege is a corruption of everything we are supposed stand for.
To rescue the nation – and ourselves – from this crisis of unequal opportunity, the Republican Party must return to its own truest self.
Not simply on behalf of those Americans who have fairly worked their way up the ladder of success – but for those still climbing… and especially those clinging to the lowest rungs.
For a political party too often seen as out of touch, aligned with the rich, indifferent to the less fortunate, and uninterested in solving the problems of working families, Republicans could not ask for a more worthy cause around which to build a new conservative reform agenda.
And so, the great challenge to the Republican Party is to craft such an agenda that is at once more responsive to the inequality crisis plaguing American society today, and more consistent with our true, conservative principles.
The core of that agenda should be
restoring
equal opportunity – the natural, God-given right to pursue happiness – to the individuals, communities, and institutions from whom it has been unfairly taken.
This new agenda should ultimately address the ongoing problems of immobility at the bottom of our economy, insecurity within the middle class, and cronyist privilege at the top.
But the first and most important piece of this
“pursuit of happiness”
agenda should restore equal opportunity to the first and most important institution of them all…
The institution that unites all Americans regardless of race, class, creed, or politics: the institution of the family.
Here, I am not speaking about the family as a
moral
or
cultural
institution - strictly as a social and economic one.
Conservatives sometimes get criticized for putting too much emphasis on the family in policy debates. But a growing body of evidence – much of it developed here at A.E.I. - suggests the critics have it backwards. The real problem may be that we don’t think about family
enough
.
For family is not just one of the major institutions through which people pursue happiness. It is the one upon which all the others depend.
More than that, in recent years, the family has emerged as perhaps the most important institution
in our economy
.
The family is an incubator of economic opportunity, and an indicator of economic success.
It is every individual’s primary source of human and social capital: habits and skills like empathy, self-discipline, trust, and cooperation that grow more economically important every day.
The family is where we learn the skills to
access
and
succeed in
America’s market economy and civil society… and thereby create new opportunities for others to do the same.
The primacy of family should inform conservative policies about everything from welfare to education to transportation to criminal justice.
If there is any
single
group of people in the entire country whose equal opportunity to pursue happiness we should make sure to protect, it is our ultimate entrepreneurial and investor class: America’s moms and dads.
Yet sure enough, the federal government actually singles out parents of young children for unfair and extremely expensive discrimination.
Which brings me to the tax reform plan I will be introducing in the Senate in coming days.
The “Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act” is based on the traditional conservative tax reform principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fairness.
It lowers rates, consolidates brackets, and eliminates deductions and loopholes.
Economic conservatives have for decades supported fundamental tax reform that accomplishes these goals. And so have I.
But the problem is, there’s
another
problem. It’s a
hidden
problem that even thoughtful, conservative proposals might accidentally make worse.
That problem is what I call the Parent Tax Penalty.
Here’s how it works.
As you know, the federal senior entitlement programs – Social Security and Medicare – operate as generational transfer payments, not individual insurance policies.
Taxes that workers pay
today
fund
today’s seniors’ benefits
. In the same way, when
you
retire, your benefits
then
will be paid by the taxes of workers in the future.
In the simplest terms, any one generation pays for the Social Security and Medicare benefits of its parents… and then, in turn, has its own benefits paid by its children.
Therein lies the familiar bargain of the system, but also an unintended consequence: the parent tax penalty.
Under the current system, all seniors are entitled to the same benefits, based on their total lifetime contributions.
But
parents
are required to
contribute
to this system not once, but twice. First, when they pay their taxes, just like everyone else. And then
again
, by bearing the enormous economic costs of raising their children, who in time, of course, grow up to become the next generation of taxpayers.
Under the current system, parents receive
no additional
benefits for having contributed or sacrificed hundreds of thousands of additional dollars raising their kids.
This is the inequity my bill is designed to highlight and address.
Like any policy mistake, the parent tax penalty can be connected to various distorted incentives and unintended consequences. But for our purposes today, they are mostly beside the point.
This hidden, double tax on parents - in and of itself - violates conservatism’s core principle of equal opportunity.
Another way to think about it is that current policy imposes an enormous “capital gains” tax on the economic, human, and social capital that
all
parents invest in their children, and in our country.
The current system - including its one-thousand-dollar per child credit - does not begin to offset this unfair tax. It doesn't really treat children as an investment at all.
We
know
better than that. We can
do
better than that. And a new Republican opportunity agenda should.
And so, in coming days I will introduce a bill to reform the tax code – which our sluggish economy already needs – to make it at once more pro-growth, pro-opportunity,
and
pro-family.
The “Family Fairness and Opportunity Tax Reform Act” would establish
two
individual income tax rates: 15% on all income up to $87,850 – and twice that amount for married couples - and 35% on all income above that.
It would eliminate most existing deductions and credits not related to children, and create in their place the following:
a $2,000 personal credit to replace the personal exemption and standard deduction;
a new
charitable
deduction that would be available to
all
taxpayers;
a new
mortgage interest
deduction, also available to
all
home-owners, but capped at $300,000 worth of principal, focusing the deduction on the families and communities who need it the most.
And the centerpiece of the plan is an additional $2,500-per child tax credit, available to
all
parents of younger children. Coupled with existing child tax provisions, this new credit will begin to equalize the tax code’s treatment of parents and children.
To that same end, this new credit would apply not only to
income
taxes, but parents’
payroll
tax liability as well – the employee
and
employer sides. And it would not phase out.
In sum, this plan consolidates tax brackets, simplifies the code, repeals the AMT and Obamacare tax hikes, lowers rates, and finally begins to address the parent tax penalty.
Now, this plan is not comprehensive. It deals only with
individual
income, not the corporate side of the code.
Nor is it meant to be the final word on tax reform. It won’t even be
my
final word on tax reform. Going forward, I would like to:
lower rates and simplify the code further,
increase the child credit even more,
reform the way we tax investments and business income, and
reform the
welfare system
to harmonize with this new tax code so that federal policy seamlessly promotes opportunity and upward mobility for underprivileged families as they work their way into the middle class.
It should be noted that the parent tax penalty
could
be dealt with through
entitlement
reform rather than tax reform, or a combination of the two.
Each of these goals is essential to economic growth and opportunity. And in my opinion we should pursue them all –
but not at the expense of ignoring or exacerbating the parent tax penalty.
For now, this plan is an attempt to apply American conservatism’s oldest principles – equality of opportunity and the pursuit of happiness - to
new
problems… to immediately improve the lives of American families.
Under this plan, a married couple with two children making the median national income of $51,000 would see a tax cut of approximately $5,000 per year.
The expansion of the 15% bracket essentially creates a low, flat tax for about 90% of all individuals and families.
From the perspective of policymakers, this should be a matter of common sense.
Right now, the tax code penalizes parents. It shouldn’t.
Many other loopholes unfairly reallocate wealth from the middle class to the wealthy. That’s wrong.
The state-and-local tax deduction unfairly transfers wealth from low-tax states to high-tax states. That’s wrong, too.
In each case, my plan would simply level the playing field to treat
all
taxpayers more equally.
But from the perspective of a middle class family, this is an immediate, potentially life-changing reform.
This is money –
their own
money, right away – for a family to get out of debt, or to move into a better neighborhood with better schools.
It could allow a single mother to afford child care so she could go back to school or take a better job.
It could allow a mom or dad working full time to scale back to part-time… or go from part-time to staying at home with young children.
It could mean tuition for a private school, or start-up capital for a small or home business.
It could mean affording health insurance, or community college… or cutting back hours at work to coach little league for a season… or just making it home in time for family dinner.
It would, in short, restore opportunities to working parents and their children
to pursue happiness
that right now federal policy unfairly denies them.
Rather than promising struggling individuals, families, and communities a small, unequal share of someone
else’s
opportunity - as the
Left
does - this plan seeks to restore to them a full, equal share of their own.
Now, if you are like me – a conservative with a libertarian streak – you might at first raise an eyebrow at all this.
My plan, you might say, may share some features of traditional conservative tax reform… but it’s no Flat tax. It’s no consumption tax.
That’s right. It’s better.
Because both of those approaches, though they might be improvements on the status quo, still don’t fix the parent tax penalty. And they might make it worse.
Some skeptics might suggest this plan is just a different kind of tax loophole for a group
conservatives
like.
Not so.
Like everyone in this room,
I hope
, I oppose
rigging
policy to unfairly favor
any
group – even middle-aged, Mormon, constitutional lawyers.
And that’s why my bill does not
tilt
the playing field
for
parents. That would be wrong. Instead, it
takes
a playing field that is right now tilted
against
parents, and levels it. That’s only fair.
Others might argue that a top rate of 35 percent is still too high.
I agree.
My plan
does
cut the top rate, but only to its level before the recent tax hikes. I put off further cuts in
this
proposal in order to focus attention on the parent tax penalty.
Last year I proposed a complete federal budget that balanced in five years. I am more than happy to lower taxes further as we reduce the size and scope of the federal government.
And, finally, some might worry that increasing the child credit would take more people off the income tax rolls altogether.
And it would.
But then again, people who pay no
income
tax do pay federal taxes – payroll taxes, gas taxes, and various others.
Working families are not free riders.
And taxpayers’ circumstances change over time. Under my plan - any parents with so many kids that they pay
no
taxes one year will know that the situation is temporary. When their kids grow up, their taxes will rise.
There is no reason to believe the people my plan
temporarily
takes off the rolls would support
permanent
expansions of government. And what we know about the way parents innately focus on the future suggests otherwise.
As with any other plan, there are legitimate questions.
But I submit that with
this
plan, the tougher the questions, the better the answers.
This plan eliminates an unfair and dysfunctional double standard in the tax code.
It provides substantial, immediate tax relief to middle class parents who today bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden.
It equalizes various other biases in the tax code, and lowers tax rates to encourage new jobs and investment.
It restores to the American people opportunities not only to form new businesses and non-profits, but new families as well.
And it challenges the Republican Party to recognize that most Americans’ most important investments mature
much more slowly
than bonds. Especially the boys.
This plan is a new idea. But I think it’s one that deserves a seat at the table, as Congress considers tax reform, and the Republican Party considers its future.
In closing, the great challenge that
is
America’s opportunity crisis ought to be the Republican Party’s
opportunity
, to remember and once again become what it has always been at its best.
To move beyond what we are
against
… to what we are
for
… to what we are:
The party of Lincoln and Reagan. The party of equal opportunity, social mobility, and economic growth. The party of individual freedom, and the heroic communities free individuals form. The party of the common man, and of America’s uncommon experiment in the pursuit of happiness.
Thank you very much.

WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement regarding President Obama’s remarks on Syria:
“The president has not convinced Americans that the Syrian civil war represents a vital national security threat to the United States.  Neither has he adequately explained how the U.S. would achieve the limited objectives his plan seeks to accomplish.  According to the administration, even after the limited military action, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would continue to have access to the chemical weapon stockpile and the ability to carry out further attacks.  My greatest concern remains the likelihood that the proposed strike would leave Assad in power with access to these weapons and lead our country further into war.  The better path for the president would be to continue to work with our allies to secure Syria’s chemical weapons and ensure they do not proliferate throughout the region.”

Title: Lee Opposes Intervention in Syrian Civil War
Date: September 5, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement in opposition to U.S. military action in Syria:
“The administration has indicated its goal is to use limited military action to significantly degrade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons against his own people and to deter future attacks.  After hearing from the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in a top-secret briefing, I do not believe that the range of options the president is considering will accomplish this military objective, and therefore I cannot now support intervention into the Syrian civil war.
“First, it remains unclear how the president’s plan to execute limited strikes would prevent Assad from using chemical weapons again or even make it less likely.  Second, it is entirely possible that ineffective U.S. strikes would embolden Assad to become even more ruthless towards his people.
“Finally, I am greatly concerned that in order to achieve the president’s goal, the U.S. would be required to become much more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war than the administration is willing to commit.   The real threat to U.S. credibility is not what happens if we don’t intervene, but what happens if we do without a plan for what comes next.
“The risks of the president’s strategy far outweigh the possible gains.  We cannot ask our men and women in uniform to engage in a military conflict that does not present a national security threat to the United States.  Instead, the U. S. should work vigorously to identify and neutralize any real threats to our national security – such as the proliferation of chemical weapons.  We must work to ensure that chemical weapons in Syria do not get into the hands of groups that will use them against American or western targets.”

Title: Lee: New Obamacare Delays are a Shameful Political Move
Date: August 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to new reports that the Obama administration is delaying another major component of the president’s health care law.  On Monday,
the New York Times
reported that a rule restricting out-of-pocket insurance costs for consumers, such as co-pays and deductibles, would be delayed until after next year’s election.   This provision was originally billed by the administration as a major cost saver for patients, particularly those with chronic disease.  But the cap was leading to huge premium increases, particularly for young families and students.
“Faced with the obvious and predictable consequences of the caps, the administration again faces another embarrassing delay of this unworkable and unfair law,” said Sen. Lee.  “The president realizes the political consequences of allowing the insurance premiums of voters to skyrocket over the next twelve months and is choosing to lay the burden on the chronically ill and most vulnerable Americans.  It is a desperate and shameful political move.
“The best way to delay Obamacare is to defund it.  Once Congress returns from the August work period, the House should act quickly to pass a continuing resolution that funds the government, but not Obamacare.  It is the only responsible course of action to protect Americans from this ill-conceived and poorly crafted policy before it is too late.”

Title: Durbin and Lee Introduce Smarter Sentencing Act
Date: August 1, 2013

Content:
Washington, D.C. – With federal prison populations skyrocketing and nearly half of the nation’s federal inmates serving sentences for drug offenses, Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) have introduced the
Smarter Sentencing Act
, to modernize our drug sentencing polices by giving federal judges more discretion in sentencing those convicted of non-violent offenses. Making these incremental and targeted changes could save taxpayers billions in the first years of enactment.
“Mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses have played a huge role in the explosion of the U.S. prison population,” Durbin said. “Once seen as a strong deterrent, these mandatory sentences have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety. Given tight budgets and overcrowded prison cells, judges should be given the authority to conduct an individualized review in sentencing certain drug offenders and not be bound to outdated laws that have proven not to work and cost taxpayers billions.”
“Our current scheme of mandatory minimum sentences is irrational and wasteful,” Lee said.  “By targeting particularly egregious mandatory minimums and returning discretion to federal judges in an incremental manner, the Smarter Sentencing Act takes an important step forward in reducing the financial and human cost of outdated and imprudent sentencing polices.”
The United States has seen a 500 percent increase in the number of inmates in federal custody over the last 30 years, in large part due to the increasing number and length of certain federal mandatory sentences. Mandatory sentences, particularly drug sentences, can force a judge to impose a one-size-fits-all sentence without taking into account the details of an individual case. Many of these sentences have disproportionately affected minority populations and helped foster deep distrust of the criminal justice system.
This large increase in prison populations has also put a strain on our prison infrastructure and federal budgets. The Bureau of Prisons is nearly 40 percent over capacity and this severe overcrowding puts inmates and guards at risk. There is more than 50 percent overcrowding at high-security facilities. This focus on incarceration is also diverting increasingly limited funds from law enforcement and crime prevention to housing inmates. It currently costs nearly $30,000 to house just one federal inmate for a year. There are currently more than 219,000 inmates in federal custody, nearly half of them serving sentences for drug offenses.
The bipartisan Durbin-Lee-Leahy bill is an incremental approach that does not abolish any mandatory sentences. Rather, it takes a studied and modest step in modernizing drug sentencing policy by:
Modestly expanding the existing federal “safety valve”: Our legislative “safety valve” has been effective in allowing federal judges to appropriately sentence certain non-violent drug offenders below existing mandatory minimums. This safety valve, however, only applies to a narrow subset of cases.
The Smarter Sentencing Act
would modestly broaden criteria for eligibility. This change, which only applies to certain non-violent drug offenses, is supported by nearly 70 percent of federal district court judges.
Promoting sentencing consistent with the bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act: The bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 – which was authored by Senator Durbin and unanimously passed the Senate before it was signed into law – reduced a decades-long sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Unfortunately, because of the timing of their sentences, some individuals are still serving far-too-lengthy sentences that Congress has already determined are unjust and racially disparate.
The Smarter Sentencing Act
allows certain inmates sentenced under the pre-Fair Sentencing Act sentencing regime to petition for sentence reductions consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act and current law. Federal courts successfully and efficiently conducted similar crack-related sentence reductions after 2007 and 2011 changes to the Sentencing Guidelines. This provision alone could save taxpayers more than $1 billion.
More information on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 can be found here.
Increasing individualized review for certain drug sentences:
The Smarter Sentencing Act
lowers certain drug mandatory minimums, allowing judges to determine, based on individual circumstances, when the harshest penalties should apply. The
Act
does not repeal any mandatory minimum sentences and does not lower the maximum sentences for these offenses. This approach keeps intact a floor at which all offenders with the same drug-related offense will be held accountable but reserves the option to dole out the harshest penalties where circumstances warrant. These changes do not apply to penalties for violent offenses.
The bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act is supported by faith leaders from the National Association of Evangelicals to the United Methodist Church. It is supported by groups and individuals including Heritage Action, Justice Fellowship of Prison Fellowship Ministries, the ACLU, Grover Norquist, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the Sentencing Project, Open Society Policy Center, the American Bar Association, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Constitution Project, Drug Policy Alliance, Brennan Center for Justice, and Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Read the Deseret News' Editorial Board's opinion editorial on the
Smarter Sentencing Act:
In our opinion: Roll back mandatory minimum sentences and allow judges to measure out punishment
"A bipartisan measure in Congress to roll back mandatory minimum prison terms is a welcome effort to reform federal criminal law sentencing. Excessive sentences harm individuals convicted, who sometimes spend decades in jail for drug crimes far less heinous than murder or rape. More importantly, unwarranted sentences harm our penal system, mocking principles of justice and mercy."

Title: Senators Call For Defunding of ObamaCare in Upcoming CR
Date: July 25, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and 13 of his Republican colleagues sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), stating that they will not support a continuing resolution that funds further implementation or enforcement of ObamaCare.
Signers of the letter include Senators Rubio (R-FL), Cruz (R-TX), Risch (R-ID), Paul (R-KY), Inhofe (R-OK), Vitter (R-LA),  Thune (R-SD), Chiesa (R-NJ), Enzi (R-WY), Fischer (R-NE), Crapo (R-ID), Roberts (R-KS), and Grassley (R-IA).
Lee also announced an initiative calling on Americans to co-sign the letter to Sen. Reid.
http://www.lee.senate.gov/index.cfm/dont-fund-it
“The Obama Administration's recent decision to delay Obamacare's employer mandate and eligibility verification for the individual exchanges is further proof the law is a failure that will inevitably hurt businesses, American families, and the economy.
“In light of this admission, I and several of my colleagues will be informing Senator Reid that we will not vote for a continuing resolution that funds Obamacare.
“I call on all Americans who oppose the unfair implementation of the president’s health care law to join us in the effort to fund the government, but not Obamcare.  If the president can't follow his law, then the American people shouldn't fund it.”
The full text of the letter is available below:
Dear Leader Reid:
We view the Obama Administration’s recent decision to delay ObamaCare's employer mandate and eligibility verification for the individual exchanges as further proof the law is a failure that will inevitably hurt businesses, American families, and the economy.
In light of this admission, we believe the only way to avert disaster is to fully repeal ObamaCare and start over with a more sensible, practical approach to reforming our healthcare system.
However, if Democrats will not agree with Republicans that ObamaCare must be repealed, perhaps they can at least agree with the president that the law cannot be implemented as written.  If the administration will not enforce the law as written, then the American people should not be forced to fund it.
This is a matter not only of fiscal prudence, but of fundamental fairness as well. The president cannot seriously expect to waive ObamaCare’s onerous mandates on large businesses, while simultaneously forcing individuals and families to pay to implement an individual mandate the public has opposed since before the law was even passed.
For these reasons, we will not support any continuing resolution or appropriations legislation that funds further implementation or enforcement of ObamaCare.
Sincerely,
Sens. Lee, Rubio, Cruz, Risch, Paul, Inhofe, Vitter, Thune, Chiesa, Enzi, Fischer, and Grassley.

Title: Senator Lee Voices Opposition to Department of Labor Nominee, Thomas Perez
Date: July 18, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today Senator Lee voiced his opposition to the nomination of Thomas E. Perez to be U.S. SEcretary of Labor. The full remarks of the speech as prepared for delivery can be found below:
I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the nomination of Thomas E. Perez to be U.S. Secretary of Labor.
There is no shortage of reasons why Mr. Perez should not be confirmed.  Several of my colleagues have come to the floor to discuss a number of troubling facts about Mr. Perez’s professional history, each one of them reason enough to disqualify his nomination.
Mr. Perez has abused his position as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.  Rather than seek out and expose instances of racial injustice, Mr. Perez has turned the office into his own personal tool of political activism.
For example, a report issued by the Department of Justice’s Inspector General found that during Perez’s tenure at the CRD, employees harassed colleagues for their religious and political beliefs.
And, despite having little if any evidence of racial discrimination, Mr. Perez has repeatedly opposed the efforts by states to ensure the integrity of their elections. Under his direction, the Civil Rights Division has pursued frivolous lawsuits against voter ID laws, ignored statutes that require states to purge ineligible voters, and slow-walked attempts to protect the voting rights of military members.
While head of the CRD, Mr. Perez’s unit also used spurious and misleading claims to allege racial discrimination and selectively enforced laws to target unfavored groups.
Most troubling, Mr. Perez has willfully disregarded a lawful subpoena from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to produce documents relating the use of his non-official email account for official purposes.  According to the Chairman of that Committee, “Mr. Perez has not produced a single document responsive to the Committee’s subpoena” and “remains noncompliant.”
At a minimum, this is a basic violation of the rule of law and impedes a fundamental function of the legislative branch to provide oversight of the administration.
Anyone showing this type of willful disregard for the law and ambivalence toward America’s essential principles of democracy should not be considered for a top post in any administration.

Title: Lee: ObamaCare is "Unaffordable and Unfair"
Date: July 17, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON — Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered remarks regarding the need to withhold funding for ObamaCare, saying that no appropriations bill or continuing resolution should fund further implementation of the law. “It is fundamentally unfair for President Obama to exempt businesses from the onerous burdens of his law, while forcing American families and individuals into Obamacare’s unsound and unstable system,” said Senator Lee.
The full text of Senator Lee’s remarks is available below:
Mr./Madame President,
Two weeks ago, while most Americans were busy getting ready for the Fourth of July holiday, the Obama Administration made a stunning announcement about the president’s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act.
The president admitted to the American people that because Obamacare was so poorly crafted, he was delaying the enforcement of the employer mandate and would not assess fines and penalties to big companies that did not provide insurance to their employees.
The president explained that businesses could not handle “ the complexity of the requirements,” and that government bureaucrats would spend the next year simplifying the reporting rules so companies could comply.
I expected that in the next paragraph he would acknowledge that American families also deserved relief because, as polls consistently reflect, they have very big problems with the requirements, as well. They have concerns about the government-run health care scheme, known as “the exchanges.”  Henry Chao, the chief technical officer in charge of implementing the exchanges, has said, "I'm pretty nervous . . . Let's just make sure it's not a third-world experience."
American families also have very grave concerns about how much Obamcare is going to add to the national debt. The CBO now estimates that the cost to taxpayers over the next ten years will be $1.8 trillion.
Young Americans are particularly concerned about Obamacare because it is becoming clear that they will see the highest increase in premiums. One study published in the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries shows that middle- and low-income single adults between 21 and 29 years old will see their premiums rise by 46% even AFTER they take the Obamacare subsidy.
A joint report by Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce, Senate Finance, and Senate HELP committees that looked at over 30 different studies concluded that “Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent. Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent.”  In my state of Utah, premiums for young people will jump anywhere from 56 to 90 percent.
As I read the statement from the Treasury Department, I was shocked to find no mention of these people.  Parents, families, students, employees, taxpayers and other hardworking Americans were totally left out, along with THEIR “concerns about the complexity of the requirements.”
A senior advisor to the president took to the White House blog to spin the Administration’s announcement.  She said QUOTE, “In our ongoing discussions with businesses we have heard that you need the time to get this right.” But why aren’t American families part of these ongoing discussions? Isn’t the White House obligated to “get this right” for them, too, BEFORE assessing fines and penalties and forcing them into a government-run “third world experience?”
We knew Obamacare would be unaffordable. But now we know it’s also going to be unfair.
It is fundamentally unfair for President Obama to exempt businesses from the onerous burdens of his law, while forcing American families and individuals into Obamacare’s unsound and unstable system.
It is unfair to protect the bottom lines of big business, while making hardworking Americans pay the price through higher premiums, stiff penalties, cut-backs in their hours, and job loss.
It’s unfair to give businesses more time to figure out complex rules and regulations but force everyone else to figure out equally complex mandates and requirements.
This administration has chosen to put its own political preferences and the interests of various government cronies ahead of the American people.
Republicans in Congress must now stand up for the individuals and families who do not have the money, lobbyists, and connections to get this Administration’s attention.
And we should do so using one of the few constitutional powers Congress still guards – its power of the purse. As long as President Obama selectively enforces Obamacare, no annual appropriations bill or continuing resolution should fund further implementation of the law.
In other words, if the president won’t follow it, the American people shouldn’t fund it.
The recent admission by the administration means that after three years of preparation and trial and error, the best-case scenario for Obamacare will be rampant dysfunction, waste, and injustice to taxpayers and hard-working families.
Even the president himself has now admitted that Obamacare won’t work. It is unaffordable and unfair.  If he won’t follow it, we shouldn’t fund it.
The only responsible choice now is to protect the country from Obamacare's looming disaster, start over and finally begin work on real health care reform that works for everyone.
Thank you Mr. President.

Title: Lee: Defund ObamaCare in the Next Spending Bill
Date: July 9, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) responded to the Obama administration’s announcement that it would selectively enforce certain areas of ObamaCare:
"Delaying the employer mandate and exchange verification rules is the latest and most damning admission by the administration that ObamaCare was poorly crafted, remains unworkable, and, if implemented, will hurt American families, businesses, and our economy. The only solution is to fully repeal ObamaCare and start over with a more sensible, practical approach to fix our health care system.
"Short of full repeal, however, those of us who care about the health care and security of the American people still have a duty to act. If the president has decided he won't enforce his law as it is written, then Congress should not fund any further implementation of it at all.
“It is fundamentally unfair for President Obama to exempt businesses from the onerous burdens of his law, while forcing American families and individuals into ObamaCare’s unsound and unstable system.
“This administration has chosen to put its own political preferences and the interests of various government cronies ahead of the American people. Republicans in Congress must now stand up for the individuals and families who do not have the money, lobbyists, and connections to get this Administration’s attention.
"And we should do so using one of the few constitutional powers Congress still guards – its power of the purse. As long as President Obama selectively enforces ObamaCare, no annual appropriations bill or continuing resolution should fund further implementation of the law.
“Last week’s admission by the administration means that after three years of preparation and trial and error, the best case scenario for Obamacare will be rampant dysfunction, waste, and injustice to taxpayers and working families.
“If congressional Democrats want to oppose appropriations bills without additional ObamaCare funding, shut down the government, and side with the President and big business against the American people, then it's their choice. But three years in, even the president himself has now admitted that ObamaCare won’t work. The only responsible choice now is to protect the country from ObamaCare's looming disaster, start over and finally begin work on real health care reform.”

Title: Lee Delivers Remarks, Calls Gang of 8 Bill a “Disappointment”
Date: June 27, 2013

The
#Go8
bill we have before us today is an enormous disappointment. The American people deserve better:
http://t.co/mLTfzGCHwz
— Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee)
June 27, 2013
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered remarks on the Senate floor, expressing his opposition to the Gang of 8 immigration bill.
I rise today in support of immigration reform.
I support strengthening our borders and ensuring they are secure before beginning a pathway to citizenship because it is the only way we will avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.
I support robust interior enforcement and a biometric visa tracking system because without them we will not solve the problem of illegal immigration.
I support modernizing and streamlining our visa system because we need an efficient process of legal immigration that meets the needs of our economy.
And I support immigration reform that is both tough on those who have chosen to break our laws and fair for those who have obeyed them.
Today, there is reason for disappointment but also cause for encouragement.
The bill we have before us today is an enormous disappointment.  The American people deserve better.
As a matter of public policy, this bill fails to meet many of the goals we set out to meet.
It is full of promises to beef up border security, but makes no assurances.  This legislation cuts out the American people by cutting out any congressional oversight.  It remains grossly unfair to those who have languished in our current legal immigration system, unable to get answers for decades in some cases.   It transfers enormous authority and discretion to the Executive Branch, exacerbating an already widespread problem in our federal government.
And it fails perhaps the most important test of all: according to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill will reduce illegal immigration by just 25 percent in the next ten years.  This should be reason alone to scrap this entire bill.
As a matter of process, members of this body should be embarrassed about how this bill moved through the Senate.
From Day One, the country was misled about what was in the bill. The talking points never matched the reality of what was in the bill.
We were told that if we didn’t like what was in it, we could fix it.  But that wasn’t true either.  During the committee “mark up,” Democrats and the Gang of Eight Republicans voted as a bloc to defeat virtually all substantive amendments proposed to improve the bill.
They said there would be regular order on the floor.  But that turned out to be a false promise as well.  For a 1200-page bill, the Senate, including the members not on the Judiciary Committee, was allowed exactly 9 roll call votes before the process was shut down.
During the 2007 debate on immigration reform, the Senate voted 32 times to amend the bill.  Some would argue even that was too small.  But certainly nine votes on a 1200-page bill doesn’t suggest that the proponents of the bill are interested in regular order.
And for the grand finale, at nearly the end of this process, the proponents substituted what is effectively a brand new bill in place of the one we had been debating for over two months.  They gave us very little time to read it before we had to vote on it, and, once we were on to the new bill, they did not allow a single vote on any amendments.
Mr./Madame President, this is an embarrassment to this institution and an assault on the principles of democracy.
But like a phoenix rising from the ashes, from this low point in the Senate springs an encouraging path forward for those, like me, who truly want immigration reform.
First, this exercise has laid out in front of the American people all the problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation that presume to fix all of our problems at once.   The so-called comprehensive approach has been utterly discredited.
From denying votes to buying votes, our experience over the past two months only reaffirms why the vast majority of Americans don’t trust Washington.  The special interests had a huge hand in writing the bill while the American people had none.  Almost all of the discussions and negotiations took place in secret back-room deals.  And rather than debate policy differences, the debate was a daily “fact check” on misleading and outright false claims made by the bill’s proponents.
The good news is that the House appears to have learned this lesson and wants no part of it.  Already, the Speaker has said the Senate bill is dead on arrival – so today’s vote is largely symbolic.
The House Judiciary Committee has recently passed two significant pieces of immigration reform – one on interior enforcement and another dealing with agricultural workers – proving that reform can be passed in a step-by-step approach.
Indeed, the only reason immigration reform is controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one piece at a time.  There is simply no legitimate reason why we have to pass a one-size-fits-all, take-it-or-leave-it bill.
Though it is likely this bill will pass today, I strongly encourage my colleagues to consider where we started, where we are now, and what lies ahead.
They said it would secure the border. It doesn’t.  Congress has been fooled by false promises before.  We shouldn’t go down that path again.
They said illegal immigration would be a thing of the past.  It won’t. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that under this bill there would still be 6 to 8 million illegals in the country in ten years.
They said it would be good for the economy.  It isn’t. CBO also confirmed it would lower wages and increase unemployment.
They said it would be tough but fair.  It’s neither.  It is not tough on those who have broken the law and it is not fair for the people who have been trying to come here legally.
And if this bill passes today, it will be all but relegated to the ash heap of history, as the House appears willing to tackle immigration reform the right way.
The sponsors of this bill had the best of intentions, but in my opinion, intentions aren’t enough.
As I said at the outset, Mr./Madame President, I stand here today in support of immigration reform.  But this bill is not immigration reform.  It is big government dysfunction, and it is why I cannot support it.

Title: Lee Reacts to Supreme Court Decision on DOMA
Date: June 26, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision striking down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act in the case
United States v Windsor
:
“I am disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision today regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  I believe that Act was a reasonable, constitutional exercise of the federal government’s power to determine the proper application of federal benefits. If the American people have changed their mind about that policy, then Congress, not the Court, should adjust it.
“Marriage is, and always will be, the basic unit of human community and civilization. And we have thousands of years worth of compelling reasons to protect it in law. Traditional marriage is not a threat to freedom and equality, but a bulwark of them.
“Today's decision leaves to the States to determine their own legal definition of marriage.  This is as it should be under the Constitution. States needn’t agree on the definition of marriage in order to respect each other’s right to legislate on that question.
"I believe marriage is properly defined as between one man and one woman.  I hope the Court will respect its own decision and the constitutional rights of Utahns and citizens of every state to legislate in their own States according to their beliefs and values."

Title: Lee Reacts to Supreme Court Decision to Hear Recess Appointment Case
Date: June 24, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) reacted to the Supreme Court’s decision to hear National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning, to determine whether the President overstepped his authority by making appointments when the Senate was not in recess.
“Although I am pleased to hear that the Supreme Court will address the constitutionality of President Obama’s purported recess appointments, had the Senate protected its institutional prerogatives and objected to the President’s violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers, the case would never have needed to go to court," said Sen. Lee.  "The Senate has an essential role in the confirmations process.  The Constitution authorizes the President to appoint judges and executive officers only when he does so with the advice and consent of the Senate.  I believe members of the Senate should have guarded their role in the confirmations process and upheld the Constitution’s separation of powers by taking actions that would have ensured the President could not bypass the Senate and unilaterally make appointments with political impunity.  Because the Senate failed to do so, the Court should address the matter.”
Days after the appointments were made, Senator Lee became the primary advocate for the Senate’s constitutional role in the nominations process. He immediately began speaking out against the unconstitutional appointments in
meetings
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the
floor
of the U.S. Senate, in a
hearing
before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and in countless interviews in the
press
.  In addition, in protest of the appointments, Senator Lee voted against President Obama’s judicial and executive appointments until the Senate ceased confirming circuit court judges prior to the 2012 elections.

Title: Murphy, Udall, Lee, Paul introduce bill to block military funds to Syria
Date: June 20, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced bipartisan legislation to prohibit the President from using any funds on activities that would escalate U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war.
The bill would ban the Department of Defense, the CIA and all other intelligence agencies from funding any military, paramilitary or covert operations in Syria.The legislation would not affect humanitarian aid.
All four senators have spoken out strongly in opposition to President Obama’s decision to arm rebel groups in Syria.Murphy, Udall and Paul, all members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cast the lone votes in Committee against authorizing the President to arm and train rebels fighting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.
“I’m deeply skeptical about plans for military intervention in Syria, given the dangerously fractured state of the opposition, and the very real risk of American weapons and money falling into the hands of the same terrorist organizations we’re already fighting around the world,”said Murphy. “We should be extremely wary of allowing the United States to be drawn into a complicated proxy war that could mire our country for years at a potentially incalculable cost to U.S. taxpayers and America’s reputation at home and abroad. Our focus should be on increasing humanitarian assistance to refugee populations and opposition groups instead of injecting more weapons into the conflict. At the very least, the American people deserve a full and honest debate on the issue in the full Congress before our nation makes a commitment to becoming more deeply involved in the Syrian conflict.”
“I am deeply disturbed by the current situation in Syria and atrocities committed by President Assad and his army, and that deserves the attention of the international community,”said Udall. “But there are too many questions about how the President’s decision to arm the Syrian rebels is going to be handled, and unfortunately many of those answers are being kept secret.We don’t know where the money is coming from, who the arms are going to, and whether the arms are going to individuals who have the capabilities to maintain a chain of custody of those weapons.This would not be acceptable in any standard sale of weapons to another government and should definitely not be acceptable for sales to a rebel organization we know little about.We need to place a check on the President’s unilateral decision to arm the rebels, while still preserving humanitarian aid and assistance to the Syrian people, and that is why I’m introducing this bill.Bottom line: We cannot get involved in another civil war in the Middle East.”
“The conflict in Syria has been going on for over two years, yet there are many questions surrounding the composition and goals of Syrian opposition groups and the interests of U.S. national security that need answers,”said Lee. “Any military involvement in Syria, including the arming of Syrian rebels, needs to be authorized through Congress, where concerns can be publicly debated and the American people can have a say. We have to ensure that we are not arming extremist groups who seek to cause chaos in the region and harm the United States and our allies. The long-term objectives of increased involvement in Syria are vague, as are the necessary commitments and costs.The United States cannot be involved in more nation building in the Middle East.”
“The President’s unilateral decision to arm Syrian rebels is incredibly disturbing, considering what little we know about whom we are arming,”said Paul. “Engaging in yet another conflict in the Middle East with no vote or Congressional oversight compounds the severity of this situation. The American people deserve real deliberation by their elected officials before we send arms to a region rife with extremists who seek to threaten the U.S. and her allies.”
The text of the bill follows:
Title: To restrict funds related to escalating United States military involvement in Syria.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Protecting Americans from the Proliferation of Weapons to Terrorists Act of 2013”.
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON FUNDS TO ESCALATE UNITED STATES MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA.
(a) In General.—Except as provided under subsection (b), no funds made available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of, or in a manner which would have the effect of, supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Syria by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual.
(b) Exception.—The prohibition under subsection (a) does not apply to funds obligated for non-lethal humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people provided directly by the United States Government, through nongovernmental organizations and contractors, or through foreign governments.
(c) Duration of Prohibition.—The prohibition under subsection (a) shall cease to apply only if a joint resolution approving assistance for military or paramilitary operations in Syria is enacted.
(d) Quarterly Reports.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report on assistance provided to groups, organizations, movements, and individuals in Syria.
(e) Non-lethal Humanitarian Assistance Defined.—In this Act, the term “non-lethal humanitarian assistance” means humanitarian assistance that is not weapons, ammunition, or other equipment or material that is designed to inflict serious bodily harm or death.

Title: Lee and Sessions Hold Colloquy as They Wait For Corker--Hoeven Amendment Text
Date: June 20, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee and Sen. Sessions engaged in a colloquy late last night as they waited for legislative text of the Corker--Hoeven amendment to be released.  At this time, the text has still not been released. The following are excerpts from their discussion on the Senate floor:
“Second-Class Senators”
SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS: Senator Lee, I appreciate your eloquence on this issue, but I did want to share that I feel like that something is going awry in the open debatable process, and we thought we were going to have a day or two, it seems we jumped off the tracks completely.
SENATOR MIKE LEE: Yes. In fact, I find it appalling. I find it repugnant to the system of government under which we are supposed to be operating. I find it even repugnant to Article 6 of the Constitution, which makes it clear that there's one kind of constitutional amendment that is never appropriate. You can't amend the Constitution to deny any state its equal representation in the Senate. And if at any moment we end up with a situation in which we have second-class senators, senators that may commit and propose for debate and discussion and a vote, an amendment, and if we have to go to the majority leader and say “mother, may I”, then perhaps we have lost something. Perhaps we have lost the environment in which each of the states were supposed to receive equal representation.
It also seems to me to take on a certain character, a certain banana republic quality that we're asked to vote on legislation, in many circumstances, just hours or even minutes after we have received it. We take on a certain rubber stamp quality when we do that.
I remember a few months ago, in connection with the fiscal cliff debate, as we approached the fiscal cliff on New Year's Eve, we were told by our respective leaders,
“Just wait, something's coming. Go back to your offices, watch your televisions, play with your toys, do whatever it is that you do, but be good senators, run along and stay out of trouble, we're taking care of this. We'll send you legislation as soon as we're ready.”
Well, at 1:36 a.m., we received an email, and attached to that email was a 153-page document. That was the bill that we would be voting on. That bill was one that we would be called to vote on exactly six minutes later at 1:42 a.m. So to my utter astonishment and dismay, senators flocked into this room, and with very, very little objection, ended up passing that legislation overwhelmingly.
This is just one of many examples I can point to in the two and a half years since I have been here when members have been asked to vote and did in fact vote enthusiastically, willingly and with hardly a whimper of objection to legislation that they had never seen, legislation that they were familiar with only to the extent that it had been summarized for them.
Now, that brings us back to this legislation here. We've had this in front of us in one form or another for the last couple of months, but for a long time before we even had it, what we had was a summary of this.[bill]. We had a series of bullet points. Those bullet points were very favorable. For a long time, the bullet points were all we had.
I exaggerate slightly to prove a point, but they read something like this:
Is this bill outstanding? Yes. Will this bill solve all of our immigration problems? Absolutely. Is there anything wrong with this bill? Heavens no.
That's how the bullet points read, and it was on that basis that groups around the country and some members even of our own body decided that they would vote for Senate bill 744, even before Senate bill 744 even existed. We had groups across the country, some even in my home state, that came out strongly in favor of the yet to be released Gang of Eight bill, saying “
we're going to vote for it, we're going to support it, and anyone who doesn't vote for it in the United States Senate is a backward fool.“
Well, they hadn't read it. They couldn't have read it because the bill didn't yet exist.
Now, in some respects, what happened with this is very similar to what we're now facing with the yet to be released Corker amendment. I haven't seen it, but I'll tell you what I have seen. I've seen a set of very brief bullet points about the Corker amendment, and the bullet points read something like this:
Is this amendment outstanding?  Yes. Will this amendment solve our border security problems? Absolutely. Is there any problem presented by this amendment? Absolutely not.
So, I say to my friend from Alabama, if this is what I can expect in my career in the United States Senate, I am a little bit troubled. But I would ask my friend from Alabama if there's anything we can do about separate and apart from the policies surrounding this bill, anything we can do to make this a real legislative body, the kind of body that actually does debate and discuss things? Because you don't really have a true, deliberative legislative body unless you have enough time to debate things before we vote on them, to where the members can actually read them before they come up.
..........................................................................................................................
“The Talking Points Were Wrong…Grossly Misleading.”
SESSIONS: Mr. Lee, you remember in committee, our able colleague, Senator Schumer, said this was the toughest bill ever, as I recall, and it was tough as nails, but it looks like now we're told that it wasn't so tough because we have added an amendment that's going to make it tough. So is that kind of what you are saying about the talking points, you have to go beyond the bill, if it was so tough to begin with, why do they need to pass another amendment now that makes it a lot tougher?
LEE: I guess it wasn't tough enough, and they are trying to make it even tougher. But yeah, that is an interesting point. A lot of people got caught up in that kind of mindset even before the bill was released.
The Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, an institution in my home state, came out overwhelmingly in support of this bill, but the problem is the bill didn't exist. They were going off the talking points.
And here's the problem --
the talking points were wrong
. The talking points proved to be grossly misleading. The talking points told us and the proponents of the bill have continued to tell us for months even after the bill text came out and even after we had reason to know better.
They have told us a few things. They have told us, number one, illegal aliens who were legalized under this bill and who would be put on the path to citizenship under this bill would have to pay back taxes as a condition of their legalization. Did that turn out to be true? Absolutely not. When you read the fine print, one thing's very clear -- they have to pay only those back taxes that have previously been assessed by the internal revenue service. What does that mean? Well, [the taxes] have to be found due and owing. They have to have been assessed by the IRS. You don't have taxes assessed by the IRS if, as is often the case for someone who has been working here illegally, you're working off the books. This is what we call an illusory promise. They offered us the sleeves off of their vest. They offered us something that didn't exist in the first place.
We were also told a number of other things about this bill. We were told that there would be a lot of people who would be excluded, and yet we discovered that there
are a lot of people, who even after having committed crimes in this country, even after having illegally re-entered the country following a previous deportation, which by the way is a felony, many of those people will still be able to get legalized and not just remain in this country and continue working, but also continue on the pathway to citizenship and eventually become voting citizens of this country.
We were told that those people who were illegal aliens currently, who would be eligible for legalization and eventual citizenship, would not be eligible during their provisional status for means-tested welfare benefits. Well, did that turn out to be true? No. They are still eligible, for example, for the earned income tax credit which some have described as the most generous and largest in some respects means-tested program that we have.
And so these things turned out not to be true. And yet, a lot of people are still asking their Members of Congress to support this very same legislation, not because they have read it, not because any of those promises were true, but because they are still believing the promises contained in the original set of talking points which most people think are the bill. That's disturbing.
............................................................................................................................
“We’re Shut Out and Shut Down”
LEE: [O]ne of the most galling aspects of this entire debate is that as [the Corker-Hoeven] amendment has been being crafted behind closed doors in secret. We've had dozens and dozens of amendments that are written, that have been filed, that have been prepared, some of which are now pending before the Senate, and yet have we had a chance to vote on those today? No. We're told we have got to wait for the Corker amendment, which isn't even written.
So those of us who have been working on this for months and months and months and have written our own amendments and have aired them publicly and allowed our constituents and people throughout the country to view our amendments, we're shut out. We're shut out and we're shut down and we're told that we don't get a vote on them because we have got to wait for the Corker amendment. That doesn't seem fair to me, it doesn't seem just.
Now, let's look around the room. It's not as though this place is jam-packed with people. It looks like we have kind of been abandoned. A few hours ago, we had all of us here. We were ready to vote on those amendments. We could have had a lot of votes. We were told to expect votes. I was hoping to have votes.
I had a very important amendment that I wanted to get a vote on. It was a vote on an amendment to make sure that 40% of the border that is owned by the federal government could be accessed by our own border patrol agents, so they can do their jobs. [Sen. Sessions] referred earlier to a problem that we have had with our law enforcement personnel being told they can't do their jobs. Well, this is one of those many instances where they can't. You know, 40% of our border is owned by the federal government. I'm sympathetic to this because two-thirds of the land in my state is owned by the federal government, and it's terrible because we can't access most of that land. We can't even walk on that land without saying “mother, may I”, and most of the time we have to walk on, it's like a sand trap on a golf course, you have to walk in with a rake behind you, rake your way in, rake your way out and ask permission for everything you do.
The border is kind of the same way. Federally owned areas of the border, we have got huge stretches of the border, 40% of it where they can't enforce the law because it's owned by the federal government, and there are environmental laws that prohibit these border patrol agents from doing their jobs.
Now, it would be one thing if that actually protected the environment, but it doesn't, because what happens is those same areas, those same environmentally sensitive federally owned areas that illegal immigrants prefer when they choose to cross into this country. So what do we have? Well, we have got a long trail of litter and environmental destruction in the areas where they cross through illegally.
This is just one of many amendments that have been filed that are already written that we could have and should have been voting on, and we haven't been.
............................................................................................................................
“Pass the Bill Now!”
LEE: And you know, Senator Sessions, I have got a dire prediction to make. I suspect that when we come back next week, we might be told that even though the place doesn't seem to be in any hurry right now, all of a sudden it will be in a hurry next week, so much so that I fear we'll be told,
“We've got to pass this bill now! It all has to be passed now, and we don't have time for any more of these pesky amendments from these pesky senators from all over the great country of the United States of America. We have got to pass this now!”
Well, we have had time to vote on other amendments, and we have squandered that opportunity or we have had it squandered for us. You and I and a number of others have been ready to vote on our amendments, amendments that have been prepared for a long time, amendments that have been aired for the public to view for a long time. We haven't been allowed a vote, and I've got a problem with that.
............................................................................................................................
“You Got to Take Every Bit of it.”
LEE: I don't think there is any issue that even comes close to it in terms of its ability to divide Americans along partisan lines or along other ideological lines than the pathway to citizenship. Makes me wonder why, then, it's so important for us to pass this all-in-one bill.
Why do we need a single thousand-page bill? Why can't we pass this in steps? Especially when we come to an understand that if we do do it in a proper sequence, much of the problem will be easier to resolve, much of the problem will be more amenable to a more clear solution. Maybe of those among us who are undocumented are here in an undocumented state not necessarily because they want to become citizens, not necessarily because they want to live here in perpetuity. In many instances I'm told a lot of these people are here year in and year out because they're afraid if they leave and go home they won't be able to get back in.
But if we had updated and modernized our legal immigration system, if we could do that, get those laws implemented I suspect a lot of those people would choose to be able to go back home to their home countries, be with families and loved ones, knowing that the next time they wanted to come back to the United States to work, they'd have a fair shot at doing it. There would be a clear pathway for them to apply for some kind of legal status coming into this country to work for a time.  And if they had greater certainty that they'd actually be able to get back in, perhaps they wouldn't choose to remain here year in and year out. And at that point we might have a different circumstance on our hand rather than 11 million people, perhaps the number would be different than that.
I'm not sure. But one thing I do know is that if there is one way to make it more difficult to enact immigration reform, if there is one way to make it less likely that we'll have broad-based bipartisan consensus for immigration reform, that the one way do that, the one way to ensure it's going to be as contentious, as partisan, as difficult as possible is to fold it all into one. Put it in a thousand-page bill and say you've got to take all of it. You got to take every bit of it. All of it or you get none of it.
.............................................................................................................................
“Read The Bill”
LEE: It's interesting when I have individuals and groups come through my office telling me they'd like me to support this bill, I ask them, of course, why. Inevitably, they'll point to usually just one or two of the countless provisions in this thousand-page bill.
It's almost always because of one very discrete component they like. Perhaps they like the high-skilled visa reform. Perhaps they like the low-skilled visa reform. Perhaps they like some piece here or there. But it's always one or two, very discrete provisions. That's what causes them to say, “I want you to vote for this thousand-page bill.”
Inevitably I will ask them have you read the whole bill? If you haven't read the whole bill have you at least studied the whole bill, studied each of the constituent parts? Have you studied the implications of all the other provisions you'd be asking me to vote for? Inevitably, the answer is no.
It's an unqualified, unapologetic no and in many cases it's a no that is uttered in a way that makes me realize they haven't really considered the question. I don't fault them for that. Their job is not to legislate. Their job is to advocate, in many instances they're lobbyists, in other instances they're citizen groups who are just expressing their opinion. And they've got every right to do so. But my job is to legislate and before I'm asked to vote for a bill, before I'm going to vote yes on something to make it law, I've got to read it. I've got to understand it. And I've got to like not just one or two provisions, I've got to be convinced that on balance this bill makes sense for the American people and that it will do considerably more good than harm. That at a minimum won't do more harm than good. And I can't answer that question that way with this bill. I just can't get there.
So I invite all the American people, anyone who might be hearing my voice, to join me in this dialogue, to join in this discussion. If you want to be part of the immigration solution, read the bill. If you don't want to read the whole bill, study the whole bill, read a robust summary, not the cheerleading talking points put out by the bill's principal advocates but read a robust synopsis that tells you how the pieces connect together and then tell me whether you think I should vote for it.
Most of the time if people do it that way they're going to come at this with a very different conclusion.
.............................................................................................................................
“One Piece at a Time”
LEE: I think if we were to break it up into its constituent parts and debate and vote on each one, as a separate bill, I think the American people would be better served. I think more of the American people would get more of what they want out of immigration reform if we were to do it that way.
In many ways, the people who come into my office and tell me I want you to support this bill and I want you to support it because I like, you know, section 345 or whatever section they're talking about.
In a lot of ways, they're making my point for me. We ought to address this one piece at a time, just as they're addressing it with me. They're not really saying I want you to vote for Senate bill 744. Literally, technically, they are saying that, but in reality what they're saying is I want you to vote for the section that I like.
That's exactly what we ought to be doing. We ought to be voting for the section we like and we ought to be voting for it one section at a time, one piece at a time. We'll be in a much better position to do it that way.

Title: Lee Introduces Congressional Approval Amendment to Immigration Bill
Date: June 19, 2013

Content:
Mr. President, amendment number 1208 would require fast-track congressional approval at the introduction of the Department of Homeland Security border security strategies, before the award of Registered Provisional Immigrant, or RPI status, and before the eligibility for that status begins, and also at the certification of the strategy's completion, before those receiving RPI Status may become eligible to become lawful permanent residents, eligible to receive green cards.
This would be a fast track vote, one that would have to occur within 30 days after the triggering event within the executive branch. It would also be subject to a 51-vote threshold and would not be subject to a filibuster.
It is a basic function of congress to oversee the executive branch and to ensure that the executive branch is enforcing the law as enacted by Congress. In the area of border security, the executive branch in both Republican and Democratic administrations has failed to fully enforce the laws passed by Congress.
Just to give a few examples, the Secure Fence Act, which was enacted in 2006, still has not been fully implemented and, that the fencing requirement, the fence segments required by that act, still have not been built.
The US Visit entry-exit system, which was put into place by legislation enacted in 1996, still is not fully implemented. It's worth noting here that 40% of our current illegal immigrants are people who overstayed their visas. And it's very reasonable to assume that there's a significant connection between our failure to implement this entry-exit system called for by existing law and the fact that a sizable chunk, several millions of our current illegal aliens, are people who overstayed their visas.
Polls overwhelmingly show that Americans do not believe the border is secure currently and that they also believe that we should secure our borders first before moving on to certain other areas of immigration reform.
These are failures of the federal government. The American people cannot hold unelected bureaucrats responsible. In order to ensure that the voice of the American people is heard, congress must be able to vote on the border security strategy and on the certification of that strategy as a condition precedent to allowing these RPI provisions to kick in, to allowing people to enter into the pathway to citizenship and advance toward citizenship in the coming years.
To cut congress out, cuts out the American people.  And that's exactly what this bill, without an amendment like this one, would do.  So it is important to remember that to cut out congress cuts out the American people and that's what we're trying to protect against here.
Opponents of my amendment have argued that they would be unwilling to rely on a majority of Congress to approve the border security plan as a condition for allowing the RPI period to open and to proceed. But has it ever occurred to them that it might be precisely because the majority of Americans won't approve the border security plan, or at least that they might not approve of it? Or perhaps it's not a good idea to move forward on sweeping new policies that will affect generations to come without the support of the American people?
It is, after all, the American people who have to deal with the consequences of a dangerous and unsecured border. They will have to deal with cross-border violence. They will have to deal with the heartbreaking stories of human trafficking. They will have to deal with the drugs that are imported in to their communities. They will have to deal with the economic effects and the added costs of public services associated with an ongoing unsecure border. Therefore, it is the American people who should be the ones who get to say whether or not the border is secure, not the unelected unaccountable bureaucrats who have a long track record of failing fully to implement objectives established by Congress embodied in law.
My amendment would restore the voice of the American people to this process because, again, cutting out congress means cutting out the American people. I strongly urge my colleagues to defend the rights of the American people, to weigh in on this important issue and to support my amendment.

Title: Lee Statement On Failure To Pass Congressional Approval Amendment
Date: June 19, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Following the vote on Senator Mike Lee’s amendment to the immigration bill to require congressional approval of the border security plan, Sen. Lee issued this statement:
“Cutting out Congress means cutting out the American people.  Congressional approval of the border security plan would have given the American people a strong voice in determining whether or not they believe the border is secure.  After all, it is the American people who will have to deal with the consequences of a dangerous and unsecured border. They will have to deal with cross-border violence. They will have to deal with the heartbreaking stories of human trafficking. They will have to deal with the drugs that are imported into their communities. They will have to deal with the economic effects and the added costs of public services.
“The failure of my amendment means their voices have been silenced and the unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats will determine for themselves whether or not border security goals have been met.  It is yet another indication that the supporters of this bill are not serious about fixing our broken immigration system or securing the border.”

Title: Lee, Fleming Laud Passage of Religious Liberties Protections for Service Members
Date: June 17, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee praised the passage of strong religious liberty protections for members of the armed services in the Senate Armed Services Committee-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act.   The amendment clarifies that expressions of belief that do not have an adverse impact on military readiness, good order, and discipline are to be accommodated by the Armed Services.  It was adopted on a bipartisan vote as part of the National Defense Authorization Act “mark up” late last week and was cosponsored by Senators Ted Cruz and David Vitter.  Representative John Fleming of Louisiana offered a similar amendment in the House Armed Services Committee that was adopted earlier in June.
“For many of our men and women in uniform, their faith and religious beliefs are what sustain them through the enormous pressures and stresses of the battlefield,” said Lee. “If an environment is created where those service members feel that expressing their religion could be found in violation of military policy and grounds for reprimand, it will have an unsettlingly negative effect on our military. Our servicemen and women put their lives on the line everyday in order to protect our constitutionally guaranteed rights, including the expression of our beliefs.  Congress must ensure that we are protecting them as well. “
"The First Amendment rights of our military members must be protected, and I am delighted that Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services Committees of both the House and Senate have voted to ensure those protections," said Fleming. "These bipartisan votes strongly reaffirm the vision of our Founding Fathers that free speech, including that which expresses one's religious beliefs, must not be compromised. Even when there is conflict in ideas, more speech is always preferable to limitation of speech."

Title: GOP Senators: National Monuments Become Administration’s Latest Tool in War against Oil and Gas
Date: June 13, 2013

Content:
(Washington, D.C.) – The top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, along with seven other Republican Senators, including Senator Mike Lee, sent a letter to President Obama asking him not to designate large areas of federal land as national monuments.
Far-left environmental groups
are urging the White House to designate more land as national monuments, not for the purposes of protecting important historical areas, but to prevent oil and gas production on the land and to boost the re-election efforts of Democratic senators.
“Unilateral monument designations are a direct affront to democracy,” said Senator Mike Lee. “At the very least, Congress should have to approve the designations because the people’s representatives are better situated to know whether or not the citizens of a state approve of or oppose the designation.
“Monument designations under this administration deserve particular scrutiny.  After revelations that the IRS targeted political opponents of the president before the last election, we are now hearing that far-left environmental groups are expecting rewards for their support of the president.  Lands are not the spoils of political battles.  How they can and cannot be used directly affects the local and state economy, and the ability to fund things like education and infrastructure improvements.”
Cosigning the letter with Lee are Sens. David Vitter (R-Louisiana), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Jim Inhfoe (R-Okla.).

Title: Senator Lee Delivers Remarks to Faith and Freedom Coalition
Date: June 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee delivered a speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition.  Below are remarks as prepared for delivery:
Thank you very much. It’s a privilege to be with you today.
It’s always a treat to be with conservatives from places other than Washington, D.C. Unlike too many who work and reside in this city, you actually know why you’re here.
You know what you believe. And you know what you’re fighting for.
That already puts you further along the “Road to Majority” than most of us in Washington. Unfortunately, for conservatives around here, the “Road to Majority” is usually “The Road Not Taken.”
There are many reasons why this is so. But I think the biggest is that in this city, conservatives often fall into a trap – defining ourselves by what we are against.
Big government, debt, higher taxes and regulations, Obamacare.
But we don’t invest nearly as much time and energy in communicating what we conservatives are for.
And I don’t just mean what policies we advocate. Conservatism is not about the bills we want to pass, but the nation we want to be.
As you know, for conservatives, politics is just a means, not an end.
The real goal - what conservatives are really for - is not an agenda for government. It’s a vision of society. A view of the world we want to build, together.
Together. That word, “together,” is an essential – and too often overlooked – part of what we conservatives believe.
We’re all committed to bedrock principles of individual liberty, individual rights, and personal responsibility.  But the reason we fight for individual freedom is the strength, vitality, and value of the communities free individuals form.
The alternative to big government is not small government. The alternative to big government is a thriving, flourishing nation of cooperative communities – where your success depends on your service.
It’s a free enterprise economy where everyone works for everyone else, competing to see who can figure out the best way to help the most people.
And it’s a voluntary civil society, where free individuals come together to meet each other’s needs, fill in the gaps, and make sure no one gets left behind.
Conservatism has never been a vision of isolated loners. Ours is a vision of husbands and wives; parents and children; neighbors and neighborhoods; volunteers and congregations; bosses and employees; businesses and customers; clubs, teams, groups, associations and friends.
We conservatives don’t simply want smaller government – that’s not enough. We want bigger citizens, stronger neighborhoods, and more heroic communities.
We understand what liberals do not. That freedom doesn’t mean “you’re on your own.” Freedom means “we’re all in this together.”
The value we place on community is based on the value we place on the first and most important human community of them all: the family.
Conservatives have argued for years that the family must be at the core of our worldview. On issues like school prayer, or the right to life, or traditional marriage, or home-schooling, conservatives have said protecting the family is the most important part of our moral agenda.
Today, some critics say that times have changed, and we have to change with them. They say we have to reach out to people beyond our conservative base. They say we have to change the way we think and talk about families.
It may surprise some of you to hear, but I think they make a great point. Times have changed. We do need to broaden our appeal, and change the way we think and talk about family.
But ultimately, the critics have it backwards. The problem is not that conservatives have focused too much on the family -- but far too little.
Too many in Washington seem not to realize it, but the rapid changes we have seen in recent years in America have only made the family more important, not less. The family is the foundation not only of our society, but of our economy, our culture, and our democracy as well. The family is indivisible from any facet of America’s history or destiny. Crises like divorce, fatherlessness, and social isolation – while moral in nature – have enormous social and economic consequences.
In the same way, economic problems like unequal opportunity; stagnant wages; and the spiraling costs of housing, health care, and education represent moral threats to family stability and national unity.
Working families today are bearing the brunt of all of the above. And as a result, too many are falling behind.
Their anxieties are very real – and so are the liberals’ flawed, seductive, big-government proposals to relieve them. To address those anxieties, it is not enough for us simply to oppose liberals’ ideas. We have to propose conservative ones. We have to show working families that bigger government will not solve their problems; that instead, bigger government is creating them.
The “Road to Majority” may be the road less traveled, but it’s long past time for conservatives to take it. Our movement is at its best when we take on big challenges.
And the great challenge of our time is the challenge of the forgotten family: the honest, noble parents across the country trying to make ends meet in a society, economy, and democracy increasingly rigged by Washington against them and their children.
It is time for a new conservative reform agenda that levels the playing field and finally meets the challenges facing working families:
To give underprivileged families a fair chance to work their way into the middle class;
To give families struggling to stay in middle class their fair chance to make a good living and build a good life;
To make it easier for couples for start families… for entrepreneurs to start businesses… and volunteers to start civic and charitable organizations;To help all Americans at every step along the path to success overcome the obstacles big government has put before them.
It is time for a new approach to taxes, to not only lower rates to spur economic opportunity, but to eliminate tax discrimination against parents and families.
It is time for a new approach to education, to break up the special-interest cartels that hold back our young children, and our young adults. Education is opportunity, and government has no business telling students where they can and can’t go to get it.
It is time for a new approach to transportation. New roads mean new neighborhoods, new communities, new jobs, new families, and new opportunities.
Yet today, infrastructure money states could be spending on those opportunities, Washington instead spends on bureaucratic waste and special-interest giveaways.
It is time to rethink a dysfunctional welfare system that holds poor families down. And to reform a corrupt corporate welfare system that props big businesses up.
We need to find new ways – conservative ways that rely on free enterprise and civil society -- to help young couples: get married, afford a home, raise and educate their kids, get good health care, take care of their elderly parents, and retire with security themselves.
Our movement has always identified with those Americans who through hard work and determination have climbed the ladder of success. And we always should.
But our ideals demand we identify even more with those Americans still on the bottom rungs, where the climbing is harder, dangerous, and lonely.
We need to stand up for those Americans no one else will: for the unborn child in the womb; for the poor student caught in the failing school; for the reformed father languishing in prison and the fatherless son facing alone the dangers of the street; for the single mom working two jobs but still ensnared in big-government poverty traps; for the elderly and the disabled, dehumanized by bureaucracy; and for the splintering neighborhoods that desperately need them all.
These families, these moms and dads and grandparents and kids: they’re waiting for us. They know more government isn’t the answer. They know government only divides them.
But they also know that too often our party has ignored them. That has to change.
And it has to change today - right now - because every hour, every day, big government leaves more and more American families behind. It is time for conservatives to remember those forgotten families. In word and deed, in our hearts and in our agenda.
It is time to remember that the most audacious entrepreneurs in America are not high-tech CEOs in Silicon Valley… they’re a young couple at a church back home, saying “I do.”
It is time to remember that the most important investments in our nation’s future are not issued on Wall Street, but are sleeping in their mothers’ arms at the maternity unit of your local hospital.
To be truly pro-growth and pro-opportunity, our agenda must be truly pro-family. Not just on some issues, but all of them.
I believe if conservatives look anew at the challenges facing the family, we will quickly discover opportunities to meet - united and undaunted - the challenges facing our movement, our economy, and our nation.
Building a new conservative agenda of reform around these moms and dads and kids – remembering America’s forgotten families – is the “Road to Majority.”
And if – at long last – conservatives finally take that road less traveled, it will make all the difference.
Thank you for everything you do. Keep the faith. And may God bless you all.

Title: Lee Opposes the Metal Theft Prevention Act
Date: June 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement on his opposition of the Metal Theft Prevention Act:
“Theft of valuable metal is a serious crime that can damage government infrastructure and cause great harm to businesses.  For this reason many states, including Utah, have enacted measures to deter such criminal activity and punish those who engage in it.
“Where the federal government enacts legislation creating criminal penalties, legislators must be careful to respect the Constitution’s enumerated powers and structure of federalism.  I have heard concerns expressed regarding people stealing valuable metal and crossing state lines to sell the stolen product.  While I would support federal legislation addressed to such truly interstate circumstances, legislation that more broadly regulates intrastate conduct is constitutionally problematic.
“In my view, this bill exceeds Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and imposes a federal regulatory scheme in an area of law the Constitution reserves to the states. In the interest of maintaining the balance between state and federal authority, I will vote against reporting this bill from the Judiciary Committee.”

Title: Gang of 8 Bill: Bigger Problems Than Just Border Security
Date: June 12, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke in opposition of the “Gang of 8” immigration bill on the Senate floor. The full remarks are available below:
This week we continue a very important discussion about how to fix our broken immigration system.
One of the most important concerns we have is that the border is not secure.  Despite the fact that this assertion is almost universally held on both the right and the left, the bill we are debating today does very little, if anything, to make the border more secure.
Instead, the bill offers more of what the American people are used to from Washington: plans, promises, commissions, studies and spending lots of money – but requires almost no action on border security.
Many on my side of the aisle have placed heavy emphasis on strengthening the border-security provisions to ensure that certain goals are met before granting permanent legal status to illegal immigrants.
The reason for this is not academic; it’s common sense. Failing to secure the border is the quickest way to repeat the mistakes of the past.  It means we will be back here in another 20 years dealing with a much larger and less manageable problem.  That’s what we’re trying to prevent today and why we need to make sure this bill secures the border.
But the problem with this bill isn’t just the weak border-security measures.
Even if we can come to some satisfactory conclusion on the security issues, this bill still fails to reform many of the challenges we face and makes most of them worse.  If all we do is fix the border-security portion, this bill is still considerably weak in four major areas, and would still be unworthy of support without major changes.
First, there is no congressional oversight of how the executive branch implements these reforms.  By passing this bill, Congress would turn over almost all authority to the executive branch to secure or not secure the border, verify or not verify workplace enforcement, certify or not certify visa reforms.
And, of course, the administration will begin the legalization of 11 million illegal immigrants, with no input from Congress, as soon as possible regardless of how much progress has been made on the border and other priorities.
Congress is the branch of government most accountable to the American people.  And if the people don’t believe the border is secure, or that the visa system works, or that the country’s economic needs are being met, it is Congress that should be held accountable.
Therefore, Congress must play a predominant role in approving, overseeing, and verifying these reforms, as well as ensuring the reforms are being implemented correctly and achieving the desired results.
This bill, however, leaves Congress and the American people out of the loop.
Second, this bill surrenders control of immigration law to the Secretary of Homeland Security and other unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.  This is a problem that permeates the federal government in general.
For example, last year, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, 1,519 pages of legislation.  However, the federal government published 82,349 pages of new and updated rules and regulations to the federal register.   That’s more than 82,000 pages of rules that never came before Congress, never had a chance to be amended, and never received a vote.
This bill will make that problem worse by granting similarly broad discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to create the rules and regulations that will determine how the bill is implemented, as well as authorize the Secretary, in hundreds of instances, to simply ignore immigration law.
While I can certainly see why members of Congress would not want to take responsibility for the consequences of this mess of a bill, that is not how our republic should function.
Third, this bill is inherently unfair to the countless thousands who have tried to navigate our current broken immigration system.  For example, I received a letter just a few months ago from a constituent in Utah, from a person who emigrated to this country lawfully, from a person who was teaching school in Utah, here on a nonimmigrant visa. As she explained, she spent years of her life and thousands of dollars making sure that she came to the country legally. But she understands that her visa will expire in just a few years, in 2017. She anticipates that she'll be unable to get a renewal on that same visa and that she will effectively be deported at that point, voluntarily, but her visa term will expire and she anticipates she'll have to go back to her home country.
She explained to me that it's very difficult for her to accept the fact that she's been here a year teaching lawfully, developing friendships, developing her career. When she did it legally, she'll have to go home.
Meanwhile, those who have broken the law by their illegal presence in the United States will not only be allowed to stay where they are, not only allowed to live where they now live, not only be allowed to work where they now work, but they'll be put on a path toward eventual citizenship at the same time that she and many others like her will have to go back to their home country. It seems to be rewarding those who have broken our laws, while, in relative terms, punishing those who have attempted to abide by our laws in good faith.
So this bill must be fair to those who have tried to come to this country the right way.  As my colleague Senator Grassley explained in painstaking detail yesterday, the claims of those who say there will be stiff penalties for those who have broken the law have proven almost entirely false.  There is no requirement to learn English or to pay all back taxes.  And it is quite possible that many non-citizens will be eligible for our country’s generous benefits.
Which brings me to the final concern that must be addressed before anyone should support this bill: the cost.  One study by the Heritage Foundation, says the Gang of Eight bill could cost taxpayers more than $6 trillion.
Some on the right and the left have criticized that study, and I welcome that debate.  But the proponents of this bill have so far refused to do their own cost analysis.  If they believe the Heritage Foundation is wrong, that’s fine.  But they should tell us how much they think it is going to cost taxpayers.  So far, we have heard nothing.
There are reports that Democrats have asked the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate the bill, but the report won’t be published until next week.  That’s unfortunate. If they are really concerned about the cost, and want it to be part of the debate, this should have been done long ago.
These are major portions of the bill that need to be addressed.  Even if we are able to come to a deal that makes the security portions incrementally better, as long as it still lacks congressional oversight, grants excessive authority to the executive branch, unfairly penalizes those who are trying to follow the law, and costs taxpayers trillions of dollars, we should still reject this reform unless major changes have been made.
Some have suggested that by pointing out the flaws of the bill, we are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  That vastly understates the problems in this bill. Far from “good,” this bill repeats the mistakes of the past, makes our immigration system worse than the one we have today, and will only lead to bigger and less manageable problems in the future.
I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.
Mr./Madame President, there is one more point I’d like to make as we continue this debate.
I realize this issue is very personal to some. Moments ago, I recounted a story from a constituent who takes this issue to heart.  It has affected her family, her employment, and almost every aspect of her life.  I understand that sometimes when Congress is taking on tough challenges, people’s emotions can get heated.
But let’s not forget that we are all on the side of immigration reform. As I said last week, and have said on countless occasions in interviews, op-eds, newsletters, and online, I stand here today in support of real comprehensive immigration reform.  I stand here as someone who supports legal immigration into our country.  And I understand, as all of my colleagues do, that immigration is necessary for our nation’s success.
There are those who will unfairly suggest that I and my fellow senators who oppose this bill are somehow [QUOTE] “anti-immigrant” or “anti-immigration.” Unfortunately, those are the voices that are diminishing the prospects of getting real immigration reform done this year.
I am well aware that if this bill does not pass the Senate, we will still have an immigration problem the very next day.  That’s why I have been encouraging Members of Congress to support a step-by-step approach to immigration reform.  Let’s not hold hostage the things we can get done today because we are unable to iron out every contentious issue.
There are more than 40 individual pieces of immigration-related legislation that have been introduced in this congress alone – half of which I have sponsored, cosponsored or could support.  Indeed, the only reason immigration reform is controversial is because the Senate refuses to take it step by step.
First, let’s secure the border. Let’s set up a workable entry-exit system and create a reliable employment verification system that protects immigrants, citizens, and businesses.  Then let’s fix our legal immigration system to make sure we’re letting in the immigrants our economy needs in numbers that make sense for our country.
We don’t need another thousand-page bill full of unintended consequences.  We need, and the American people deserve, real reform.

Title: Senators: End Secret Law
Date: June 11, 2013

Content:
Washington, DC - Today, Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), accompanied by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dean Heller (R-NV), Mark Begich (D-AK), Al Franken (D-MN), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), introduced a bill that would put an end to the “secret law” governing controversial government surveillance programs.  This bill would require the Attorney General to declassify significant Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) opinions, allowing Americans to know how broad of a legal authority the government is claiming to spy on Americans under the PATRIOT Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
“Americans deserve to know how much information about their private communications the government believes it’s allowed to take under the law,” Merkley said. “There is plenty of room to have this debate without compromising our surveillance sources or methods or tipping our hand to our enemies.  We can’t have a serious debate about how much surveillance of Americans’ communications should be permitted without ending secret law.”
“This bipartisan amendment establishes a cautious and reasonable process for declassification consistent with the rule of law,” Lee said. “It will help ensure that the government makes sensitive decisions related to surveillance by applying legal standards that are known to the public. Particularly where our civil liberties are at stake, we must demand no less of our government.”
"For years, I have pressed for information about the business records program authorized by the PATRIOT Act to be declassified,” Leahy said. “I am proud to join in this bipartisan legislative effort to increase openness and transparency so that we can shed further light on the business records program authorized by this law."
“Of course, ensuring Americans’ safety is one of our government’s most important responsibilities, but there is a careful balance between protecting Americans and honoring the Fourth Amendment,” Heller said. “This legislation is a measured approach that will bring more transparency to the FISA court and respect the American people’s right to know how and when the government may be accessing their personal information.”
"I remain deeply concerned over the reports of the government obtaining millions of Americans phone records. I’m pleased to co-sponsor this bill because we need greater transparency and accountability in our government  to prevent overreach and to protect against an invasion of Americans’ privacy,” Begich said. “In the coming weeks I will continue to push for a better balance between protecting our safety and protecting our Constitutional rights.”
“There needs to be a balance between Americans’ right to privacy and the government’s responsibility to keep Americans safe,” Franken said. “And ensuring that the court overseeing surveillance programs is as transparent as possible is a key step toward reaching that balance. This legislation will help make the process more open to the American people and to the people of Minnesota.”
“We must find the right balance between protecting our nation and protecting the civil liberties that make America the greatest country in the world,” Tester said. “This bill will help Congress do a better job securing that balance, while maintaining the rights guaranteed to all Americans in the Fourth Amendment.”
“It is impossible for the American people to have an informed public debate about laws that are interpreted, enforced, and adjudicated in complete secrecy,” Wyden said. "When talking about the laws governing Intelligence operations, the process has little to no transparency. Declassifying FISA Court opinions in a form that does not put sources and methods at risk will give the American people insight into what government officials believe the law allows them to do.”
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is a special U.S. federal court tasked with authorizing requests for surveillance both inside and outside the United States. Because of the sensitive nature of these requests, the FISC is a “secret court.” The FISC rulings, orders, and other deliberations are highly classified.  The Court’s rulings can include substantive interpretations of the law that could be quite different from a plain reading of the law passed by Congress, and such interpretations determine the extent of the government’s surveillance authority. There is certainly information included in the Court’s orders and rulings that is necessarily classified, related to the sources and methods of collection used by intelligence agencies. However, the substantive legal interpretations of what the FISC says the law means should be made public.
This legislation would accommodate national security concerns. If the Attorney General determines that a Court opinion cannot be declassified without undermining national security interests, then the Attorney General can declassify a summary of the opinion. If the Attorney General determines that even a summary of an opinion would undermine national security, the Attorney General is required to provide a report to Congress describing the process to be implemented to declassify FISA Court opinions including an estimate of the number of opinions that will be declassified and the number that are expected to be withheld because of national security concerns.
Last December, Senator Merkley offered this bill as an amendment to the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.  The amendment would have covered declassification of rulings related to the provisions used to authorize the controversial Verizon telephone records metadata collection and the PRISM program collecting information from tech companies, both of which were disclosed last week.  Thirty-seven senators supported the effort.

Title: Lee Reacts to NSA Tracking Phone Records
Date: June 6, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today released the following statement in response to the National Security Agency’s surveillance of Americans’ Verizon phone records.
“I am deeply disturbed by reports that the FISA Court issued an extremely broad order requiring Verizon turn over to the National Security Agency on a daily basis the company’s metadata on its customers’ calls.  Under this secret court order, millions of innocent Americans have been subject to government surveillance.”
“The Fourth Amendment safeguards liberty by protecting against government abuse of power.  Overzealous law enforcement, even when well-intended, carries grave risks to Americans’ privacy and liberty.  Members of Congress cannot continue to grant broad discretion to government agents and not expect these types of troubling outcomes.  The abuses resulting from this court order illustrate the reasons why I have opposed, and continue to oppose, controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act that are inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.”

Title: Lee, Amash Introduce Export-Import Bank Repeal
Date: June 6, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced legislation to repeal the authority of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and create a defined process for the phasedown of the bank.  Congressman Justin Amash (R-MI) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.
“The Export-Import Bank is a source of corporate welfare that puts taxpayers at unnecessary risk,” said Senator Lee.  “Instead of subsidizing exports, which encourages an international corporate subsidy bidding war, we should be using multilateral agreements to eliminate business subsidies in all nations.  The Ex-Im Bank has outlived its usefulness and it’s time to end the Bank’s market distortion and political cronyism.”
“The Export-Import Bank has always been a bad idea and needs to be shut down,” Rep. Amash said.  “Export subsidies, like those provided by the Export-Import Bank, serve only to enrich well-connected special interests at the expense of the rest of the country.”

Title: Lee Statement on Unneeded Nominations to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
Date: June 4, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement regarding President Obama’s announcement of three additional nominations to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit:
“The D.C. Circuit is among the most important federal appellate courts in the country, but it is also one of the least busy.  For this reason, both Democrats and Republicans have long agreed that the D.C. Circuit does not need additional judges.  In fact, in 2006, a group of Democratic Senators sent a letter strongly arguing against filling an available seat on the D.C. Circuit.  That letter stated that an additional nominee ‘should under no circumstances be considered—much less confirmed—before we first address the very need for that judgeship.’”
“In 2006, Democrats refused to consider the nomination of Peter Keisler—an eminently qualified nominee who enjoyed bipartisan support—for an open seat on the D.C. Circuit.  Since that time, the D.C. Circuit’s caseload has decreased, making additional judges even less necessary for that court.”
“For this reason, I am an original cosponsor of S.699, the Court Efficiency Act, which will reallocate unneeded judgeships from the D.C. Circuit to other federal appellate courts whose caseloads are many times higher.  The President’s refusal to respect Senate precedent regarding the D.C. Circuit and his opposition to legislation that would distribute judgeships to courts that actually need them makes clear that today’s nominations are nothing more than a political ploy to advance a partisan agenda.”

Title: Lee Responds To Immigration Reform Letter From Utah Mayors
Date: June 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to a letter signed by nineteen Utah mayors regarding Congress’s progress on immigration reform:
“I appreciate the letter I received from several of Utah’s mayors urging action on immigration reform, and I could not agree more.  Our current immigration system serves neither America’s economic or social interests and undermines respect for the rule of law.  That’s why I have sponsored or cosponsored several reforms, both as stand-alone legislation and amendments to the current Senate proposal, that would improve high-skilled immigration, address agricultural and seasonal workers, and create new incentives for tourism - many of which enjoy bipartisan support.
“I firmly believe that we can achieve real comprehensive reform without having to pass another thousand-page bill full of loopholes, carve-outs, and unintended consequences.  In fact, the only way to guarantee successful reform of the entire system, and ensure we are not repeating the mistakes of the past, is through a series of incremental steps that ensure the foundational pieces – like border security and an effective entry-exit system – are done properly.
“A step-by-step approach also allows Congress to move quickly on measures where Republicans and Democrats agree.  Reforms that share bipartisan support should not be held hostage to unavoidably contentious issues.
“I look forward to continuing a dialogue with Utah’s state and local leaders on the critical issue of immigration reform.  Progress on this issue is vital to our economy and security.”

Title: Lee Objects to UC on Proceeding to Budget Conference Without Assurances on Debt Limit
Date: May 23, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor today regarding the Senate Democrats’ attempt to move the budget bill to conference without assurance that the debit limit increase will not be included in the final report.
For sixty-two days, several of my colleagues and I have objected to the majority’s request for unanimous consent to circumvent regular order to go to conference with the House on the budget.
They want permission to skip a few steps in the process, and jump straight to the closed-door back-room meetings.
There, senior negotiators of the House and Senate will be free to wait until a convenient, artificial deadline and ram through their compromise – un-amended, un-debated and mostly un-read.
And with the country backed up against another economic “cliff” crisis, we are concerned they will exploit that opportunity to sneak a debt-limit increase into the budget.
We think that’s inappropriate.
And yet, objecting to this dysfunctional, unrepublican, undemocratic process has invited anger and criticism from colleagues here on both sides of the aisle.
We just don’t get it, you see.
Proceeding to a secret, closed-door, back-room, 11th-hour deal, we are told, is the way the process works. It’s the way the Senate works. It’s the way the House works.
It’s the way Washington works.
We know this. That’s why we’re objecting. In case nobody has noticed, the way Washington works… stinks.
Closed-door, back room, cliff deals are not the solution – they’re the problem.
The unspoken premise of every argument we’ve heard in favor of going to Conference on this budget without conditions... is that Congress knows what it’s doing.
“Trust us… to go into a back room and cut a deal.”
“Trust us… to ignore special interests and only work for the good of the country.”
“Trust us… to not wait until the 11th hour, to not hold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage, to not ram through another thousand-page, trillion-dollar bill, sight unseen.”
“Trust us… We’re Congress!”
As it happens, Mr. President, the American people don’t trust Congress – or either party. And we have given them at least seventeen trillion reasons not to.
I can even provide physical evidence to support my claim. If the American people had confidence in the way the Senate works… I know for a fact I would not be here. I don’t think my colleagues joining me in this objection would be here, either.
We were not sent here to affirm “the way the Senate worked” as Congress racked up trillions in debt, inflated a housing bubble, doled out favors to special interests, squeezed the middle class and trapped the poor in poverty.
We were sent here to change all that. We are fully aware that “Washington” and the establishments of both parties don’t like what we’re doing – but as computer programmers say, “that’s a feature, not a bug.”
The tactics of Washington serve the interests of Washington – of Congress itself, the federal bureaucracy, corporate cronies and special interests.
And does so at the expense of the American people, their wallets, and their freedom.
The only time I can think of when it hasn’t worked out that way was with the recent budget sequestration.
And that was – literally – an accident!  A mistake.
The sequestration process worked out exactly the opposite of how Washington expected and intended.
There is a reason, Mr. President, that six of the ten wealthiest counties in the United States are suburbs of Washington, D.C. – a city that produces almost nothing of actual economic value.
And it’s not because the two parties have been so effective taking on the special interests and doing the people’s business.
There is a reason Tea Partiers on the right and Occupiers on the left protest their shared perception that our economy, our politics, and our society seem rigged.
That elites on Wall Street, K Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue get to play by one set of rules… and people on Main Street have to play by another.
It’s because they are mostly right. This is our true inequality crisis: not between rich and poor, but between Washington and everyone else.
The national debt, and its statutory limit, is a hidden part of this inequality crisis.
After all, what is new debt but a tax increase on future Americans? On those who cannot yet vote. On those who have not yet been born.
Raising the debt limit thus results in a form of taxation without representation.
That’s why the American people resent it.
And it’s why Washington desperately wants to raise the debt limit with as little public scrutiny and accountability as possible.
And that’s why we’re objecting.
Our critics say we should allow the process to move forward so we can have a debate. I don’t know if they’ve noticed, but Mr. President, we’re having the debate. We’ve had it several days in a row.
More than that, we’re having the debate here on the floor, open to public scrutiny, and not secretly behind closed doors.
This, right here, is how the process is supposed to work.
The only way the American people can have any hope of supervising their Congress – not ours, their Congress – is for us to do our work above board and in the open, according to the rules.
That’s all we’re asking for… and only on one issue.
For all our concerns, we have still said all along that we will not block a budget conference. We can go to conference right now.
We’re willing to give the majority permission to break from regular order and scurry off to closed door negotiations to cut their back room deal.
All we have asked is one thing, a very small and simple request: leave the debt limit out of it.
Do everything else you want, spend all the money you want, use all the accounting gimmicks you want… but when you go into that backroom, check the debt limit at the door.
That way the American people can have that separate debate, on its own merits, here on the floor.
This should not be controversial. The House Republican budget did not include a debt limit increase or instructions to include one. The Senate Democratic budget doesn’t include it either.
House and Senate negotiators, therefore, have no procedural or democratic justification for including a debt limit hike in their talks. They have no right to do it.
Yet they won’t promise not to.
Once again, Mr. President: Trust us… we’re Congress.
“This is how the Senate works,” they say. “This is how we do things.”
Respectfully, Mr. President, this is how we fail. This is how we earn our 15 percent approval rating.
We know this is business as usual around here. That’s why we’re objecting.
If the majority wants to proceed to a budget conference through regular order, we cannot stop them.
But again Mr. President, that’s not their request. Their request is for permission to break from regular order, skip a few steps, and go straight to the secret negotiations, behind closed doors, where in the Washington-centered view of the world, the real governing can be done.
The American people do not trust secret, back room deals, and neither do I.
Unless and until the American people are assured then we will not sneak a debt limit increase into the Conference report, I will happily continue to object.

Title: Lee Launches “Balance in 10/#My50k” Project
Date: May 23, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee launched the “Balance in 10/#My50k” project to highlight the need for Washington to balance the federal budget.  After neglecting to submit a budget for four years, Senate Democrats finally introduced a plan that never balances and adds trillions of dollars to the national debt.   In contrast, several Republicans have submitted budgets that balance in ten years or less, without raising taxes or damaging the economy.
“Balancing the budget in ten years is a reasonable, feasible, and important goal,” said Senator Lee. “Doing so would reduce the public debt owed by each household in America by an average of $50,000.   For most people, that’s a down payment on a house, a college fund, a new car, or a sizeable investment in a small business.  Washington shouldn’t continue to steal from future generations by refusing to get its fiscal house in order today.”
According to current CBO projections, the average share of the national debt owed by each household will increase to more than $173,000 by 2023.  Under the least aggressive Republican deficit reduction plan, the House budget, which would achieve balance by 2023, the average share of the national debt owed by each household would rise much slower landing just under $124,000 – a savings of almost $50,000.  Other plans, such as Sen. Pat Toomey’s 2012 budget and Sen. Mike Lee’s Saving the American Dream plan, would achieve balance faster and save the average household an even greater amount.

Title: Members of the Utah Congressional Delegation Meet with Air Force Chief of Staff
Date: May 21, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Members of the Utah Congressional Delegation – U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Reps. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), and Chris Stewart (R-Utah) – today met with General Mark Welsh, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, to discuss a number of issues important to Utah, including sequestration  and delivery of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) regrettably was unable to attend due to a scheduling conflict.
HATCH: “I really appreciated the opportunity to sit down with General Welsh and talk about some of the most pressing issues facing the Air Force today. General Welsh assured us that the Air Force is doing everything it can to deal with the sequester in a responsible way, and we’re going to hold him to his word. And we’re now in the third delay of the delivery of the F-35 – this has been studied, it’s been discussed, and it’s high time to move forward with the delivery of the jet.”
LEE: “I was proud to join with the Utah delegation today to further cement the longstanding friendship between Utah and the Air Force.  I greatly appreciate the candid conversations we were able to have with General Welsh and General Hostage, and discuss issues facing the Air Force in our state and across the country.  Sequestration is having a devastating effect on the readiness of the Air Force, and today's meeting underscored the fact that the massive federal debt is a national security problem.   We must have a balanced budget and return fiscal sanity to Washington in order to return readiness to our fighting forces."
BISHOP: "I appreciated the chance to talk personally with the Air Force Chief of Staff General Welsh about the detrimental impact that furloughs of civilian defense workers will have at Hill Air Force Base.  General Welsh agreed that the planned furloughs ordered by Secretary Hagel will unfortunately be disruptive and costly to our dedicated civilian workforce.  He pledged to continue to work with the delegation and Pentagon Leadership on trying to find ways to mitigate those impacts as much as possible."
CHAFFETZ: “I thank General Welsh for meeting with the delegation to discuss important issues concerning the mission of the Air Force in Utah.  Hill AFB plays a critical role in our nation’s defense. We will continue working together to ensure the Air Force’s presence in Utah for years to come.”
STEWART: "I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with General Walsh today, along with other members of the Utah Delegation. As a former Air Force pilot, I know first-hand how critical it is for our nation to have a strong, able and equipped Air Force and military. We need to work to find solutions to some of the current challenges at Hill Air Force Base, including furloughs due to sequestration and grounded flight squadrons. I was encouraged by today's meeting and trust that General Walsh will do all that he can to minimize the effects of sequestration and continue to support Hill Air Force Base."

Title: Lee Statement on Letter to the International Trade Commission on Standard Essential Patents
Date: May 21, 2013

Content:
Today, Senator Lee, ranking Republican on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, led a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to the International Trade Commission (ITC) requesting that it carefully assess public interest considerations in cases involving standard essential patents.
“To develop technological standards that allow for compatibility among products made by different businesses across an industry, standard-setting organizations rely on patent holders to commit to license included patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms,” said Lee.  “Companies that have pledged not to exercise exclusivity over such patents should not expect an exclusion order from the ITC, which has jurisdiction over imports that may infringe patents, when they are under an obligation to license their patents on FRAND terms.”
The bipartisan letter—also signed by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Begich (D-AK), and Jim Risch (R-ID)—counsels against any ITC decision “that would enable or encourage companies to include their patented technology in a standard, commit to license included patents on FRAND terms, and then seek to secure an exclusion order despite a breach of that commitment.”  “Such an outcome,” the letter concludes, “would severely undermine broad participation in the standards-setting process, which would in turn threaten the meaningful benefits these standards provide for both industries and consumers.”

Title: Lee, Cruz, Paul: Don’t Use Procedural Tricks to Raise Taxes, Increase Debt Limit
Date: May 16, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul called for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a budget without using any procedural tricks to raise taxes or increase the debt limit. The Majority Leader does not deny that his intent to use a back-door procedure that would allow the Democrats to raise taxes and the debt limit under a 50-vote threshold, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold.
“We have no objection to proceeding to conference if the leader is willing to agree not to use it as a back-door tool to raise taxes or the debt ceiling.  We should not be complicit in digging this nation even further into debt on merely a 50-vote threshold,” the senators said. “After refusing to pass a budget for four years, Democrats have proven themselves willing to abuse the budget process, including sneaking in provisions to add new taxes or raise the debt ceiling.  The American people deserve assurances from Senator Reid that he will not try to hijack this bill and add tax hikes and more debt at the eleventh hour. Sneaking in a debt limit increase would be particularly egregious because it is not a part of either the House- or Senate-passed budgets.”
Knowing that under special rules a budget is not subject to a filibuster, members of Congress have in the past added measures to the budget during a budget conference that they know could not withstand a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.
Senators Lee, Cruz and Paul have indicated they plan to object to beginning the budget reconciliation process until Senator Reid agrees not to use procedural tricks to pass new tax increases or a debt limit increase.

Title: LEE: IRS Scandal More Than Just Partisan Fighting
Date: May 15, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement on the IRS scandal involving the targeting of certain conservative organizations:
“It would be a mistake for Republicans to view the latest IRS scandal as a typical partisan squabble between political parties.  The real lesson is that our massive federal government bureaucracy is inherently dysfunctional, corrupt, and intolerant regardless of who is in charge.
“The IRS is a powerful agency that can influence nearly every decision Americans make through its authority to tax and regulate.  It is one of the primary beneficiaries of our out-of-control spending and runaway debt. Organizations and individuals that promote fiscal responsibility, balanced budgets, greater government accountability, and more local autonomy present a threat to the federal expansion that gives the IRS its power.  It should not come as a surprise, then, that the culture of the IRS would promote enhanced scrutiny of these groups.
“At its core, the IRS scandal is not the result of one political party attacking another. It is the inevitable consequence of a federal government that has gotten too big and too expensive to control.  When an agency like the IRS can single out Tea Party groups; or the Department of Justice can monitor reporters’ conversations; or HHS regulators can openly extort the regulated; and there are no consequences – we are no longer citizens but subjects.
“While it is important we get answers about how and why these groups were targeted by the IRS, firing a few employees will not solve the problem.  The long-term solution is for the American people to demand that government be less involved, less intrusive, and therefore less able to carry out these kinds of abuses.”

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding revelations that the Internal Revenue Service had been targeting conservative groups:
“I am deeply troubled by reports that the IRS targeted certain conservative groups for political purposes.  Americans of all political backgrounds are rightfully calling for a thorough investigation to find out who was directing this effort, and for the individuals involved to be held accountable.  Concerns regarding this shameful abuse of power transcend partisan differences.  This should not be dismissed as just another conflict between left and right; it is a conflict between the federal government and the American people, who -- regardless of their political leanings -- should be free to exercise their constitutionally protected rights without fear of political retribution from the world's most powerful tax-collection agency.  We need to find out how this happened, why the underlying facts remained concealed until now, and what we can do to prevent the increasingly powerful IRS from targeting any group or individual based on political ideology.”

Title: Lee Delivers Remarks, Calls For Step-By-Step Immigration Approach
Date: May 9, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Lee delivered the following opening remarks at today’s Senate Judiciary executive business meeting and filing deadline for amendments S.744, the “Gang of Eight” immigration proposal. His remarks as prepared for delivery are available below.
We all agree that our immigration system is broken and must be fixed.
I support fundamental immigration reform and
am encouraged that both houses of Congress are considering such reform this year.  I believe we have an opportunity to make progress where there is broad consensus on a number of necessary reforms.
But overhauling our entire immigration system isn’t going to be simple and it won’t happen overnight.  This is because we don’t face just one big immigration challenge.  Our immigration system is a complex puzzle with dozens of interconnected pieces, and some reforms must be completed before others can even really begin.
Indeed, certain preliminary measures are necessary prerequisites for other, subsequent reforms.  For example, we simply won’t understand how best to address the problem of our constantly shifting illegal population until our borders are actually secure and we know who has overstayed their visas.  That’s why it’s futile to make decisions about later stages before the essential foundations are even in place.
Trying to solve every problem all at once is the surest way to avoid fixing any of them well.  Good policy doesn’t flow from massive bills that seek to resolve every conceivable issue in a single, sweeping piece of legislation.
We need look no further than Obamacare—another massive, comprehensive bill that just a few years after enactment was described by one of its principal authors as a “huge train wreck.”  Such wide-ranging legislation inevitably produces unforeseen effects and unintended consequences.
And we’re in the immigration mess we are today because a single, comprehensive bill in 1986 didn’t come close to fixing all our problems 27 years ago.  Despite good intentions, in many ways that bill made things worse.  The American people deserve better.
Serious efforts at lasting immigration reform will have to be considered and implemented in stages and over the course of many years.  That’s why I favor a sensible, incremental approach.
Republicans and Democrats share much common ground on the most immediate issues.  We are largely in agreement on essential elements like border security, employment verification, visa reform, guest worker programs, and high-skilled immigration—and we could enact significant reforms in each of these critical areas immediately.
Such concrete, incremental progress shouldn’t be sacrificed to demands that we try to address every challenge at once, or that we seek to resolve the most intractable problems first.  We ought not hijack meaningful progress on commonsense, preliminary measures by linking them to subsequent, contentious ones.
Instead, Congress should move quickly on a host of measures where Republicans and Democrats agree, and which will provide a necessary foundation and understanding for subsequent reforms.
I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues who have worked hard to develop the comprehensive proposal we begin to mark up today.
But I believe success in actually achieving the goals identified in this legislation must come through a series of incremental reforms that first ensure the foundational pieces — like border security and an effective entry/exit system — are implemented properly.
The long-standing disconnect between immigration policy and enforcement has created deep distrust that the federal government will, or even can, keep its promises.  For decades, Congress has legislated border and legal immigration enforcement policies, only to have administrations of both parties fail to implement them.
Many conservatives like myself are eager to enact fundamental immigration reforms so long as those reforms begin with a secure border and a renewed commitment to enforce our immigration laws.  But this bill does little to establish that foundation.
Instead, it gives broad discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to make unreviewable determinations about easily manipulated security goals.  According to one tally, the bill includes 400 different waivers, exceptions, and exemptions the administration can use to relax enforcement measures without any oversight or input from Congress.
As written, the bill’s border security triggers are illusory.  Yet the legislation provides for legalization and a path to citizenship prior to any actual, demonstrable success in securing our border.
This is precisely why such comprehensive immigration reform is so controversial: it rejects step-by-step reforms and refuses to allow the American people an opportunity to assess and approve the initial fixes before further reforms proceed.
I look forward to today’s discussion and hope that together we can move toward meaningful, incremental immigration reforms that will secure our border, uphold the rule of law, promote economic growth, and allow our nation to deal sensibly and compassionately with those who remain here illegally.

Title: Lee, Graham, Cruz Request Confirmation on Religious Liberties Policy From Hagel
Date: May 8, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senators Lee (R-UT), Graham (R-SC), and Cruz (R-TX) released a letter they sent to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel requesting confirmation of the rights of members of the armed services to practice and share their faith . The letter is a response to recent media reports indicating potential changes to military regulations governing the discussion of religion by members of the military.
"Policies that prohibit the discussion of religious matters by military members, " they write, "could create a chilling effect on members of the armed services of any faith and have an adverse effect on recruitment and retention efforts and the morale of our troops."

Title: Lee Responds to Objection to Resolution on Illegal Abortion Practices
Date: May 7, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, an objection was filed to Senator Lee’s resolution calling for a review of public policies that led to the horrific and illegal abortion practices of Dr. Kermit Gosnell and others. Lee attempted to “hotline” the resolution on Monday evening, but an unknown senator objected to unanimous passage of the language.
“It is difficult to imagine why anyone would object to a non-binding resolution calling on Congress to investigate these alleged disturbing, horrific, and illegal abortion practices committed by Kermit Gosnell and others,” said Senator Lee, who filed the resolution on Monday evening.  “With numerous reports of similar instances surfacing around the country, the need for greater regulatory oversight of these so-called clinics is so plainly obvious it strains the limits of disbelief to think all members of the Senate would not agree. The resolution is simply an affirmation that we as a country – a moral and compassionate society – have an interest in acting to save the lives of innocent women and children, and to prevent these kinds of heinous acts from happening to anyone again.”

Title: Lee Introduces Resolution to Review Illegal Abortion Practices
Date: May 6, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today Senator Mike Lee introduced a resolution calling on the Senate to review public policies that led to the illegal abortion practices of Dr. Kermit Gosnell and others.
The resolution, which has 10 original cosponsors, resolves “Congress and States should gather information about and correct abusive, unsanitary, and illegal abortion practices and the interstate referral of women and girls to facilities engaged in dangerous or illegal second- and third-trimester procedures.”
Dr. Kermit Gosnell is currently standing trial for the murder of one patient and seven newborn babies who were killed after the abortions failed and the babies were born alive.
“Congress has the responsibility to investigate and conduct hearings on abortions performed near, at, or after viability in the United States, public policies regarding such, and evaluate the extent to which such abortions involve violations of the natural right to life of infants who are born alive or are capable of being born alive, and therefore are entitled to equal protection under the law,” the resolution states.
“The facts of the Gosnell case are disturbing and heartbreaking,” said Senator Lee. “It should be a wake-up call to all Americans. The lack of oversight at abortion facilities puts women’s lives at risk and leads to the kind of unconscionable practices we have seen recently.  The Senate should formally recognize that this is a problem in our country and we have a responsibility to investigate the causes, review the effects of certain public policies, and determine what we can do to prevent any woman from being subjected to these reprehensible practices again.”
The resolution is cosponsored by Sens. Toomey (PA), Rubio (FL), Cruz (TX), Inhofe (OK), Scott (SC), Blunt (MO), Burr (NC), Vitter (LA), Johanns (NE), Thune (SD), and Boozman (AR).
The resolution also recognizes that “there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at 20 weeks after fertilization, or earlier,” and resolves that “there is a compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children beginning at least from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.”
Senator Lee is the author of the “
District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act
,” legislation that would prohibit abortions in Washington, D.C. after the 20th week of pregnancy. Lee expects to formally introduce the bill this week. For more information on this bill,

Title: Lee, Bishop ask FAA for clarification of conflicting statements on Ogden tower closing
Date: May 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee and Rep. Rob Bishop released a letter they wrote to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Michael Huerta requesting information regarding conflicting statements about the decision to close the tower at Ogden-Hinckley Airport (OGD).
The letter states that in March, Rep. Bishop wrote to Mr. Huerta at the FAA pointing out how the closure of the tower at OGD, located less than 3 miles away from Hill Air Force Base, would “result in significant negative safety impacts upon military flight operations and readiness”, and asked if the FAA had considered these impacts.
In April, write Lee and Bishop, “The FAA informed Senator Lee’s office that DOD reviewed all 189 contract towers under consideration and provided no feedback on the tower closure at OGD.”
However, DOD did confirm to Lee’s office that they had in fact provided a detailed report to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, listing the closure at OGD as having a “severe” impact on defense department operations.
“Recently, it has come to our attention that DOD identified in their report to DOT and FAA 38 contract towers whose closures would result in a ‘severe impact to operations.’  This list of severe impact’ rated towers included Ogden-Hinckley Airport,” wrote Lee and Bishop.
Lee and Bishop have asked FAA to explain why their representatives told Lee’s office they received no feedback when they had, and to describe the process of deciding which of the closures listed as “severe” would close and which would not.
“We request that FAA explain why Senator Lee’s office was told in response to the April 1, 2013 request that ‘there was no feedback provided’ by DOD on the tower closure at OGD when in fact DOD had provided a detailed report to DOT on March 21, 2013 identifying 38 Contract Towers whose closures would result in a ‘severe impact to operations’, including OGD.   We also request an explanation for its decision regarding the closure of these Contract Towers, and specifically as it relates to those towers that DOD determined would have a severe impact on mission operations.”
They added, “Our highest priority is ensuring the safety of our service-members and those who utilize these Contract Towers. This is a serious matter and we request your attention and prompt reply.”

Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Approves Leahy-Lee Electronic Communications Privacy Amendments Act
Date: April 25, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday favorably reported bipartisan legislation coauthored by Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) to protect the
privacy of emails, texts, social media posts and other electronic communications
.  Both Senators hailed the Committee’s strong bipartisan support of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2013, which updates one of the Nation’s most important digital privacy laws.
“All Americans -- regardless of political party affiliation or ideology -- care about their privacy rights,” said Leahy, an author of the original 1986 ECPA law. “That is why Senator Lee and I are joined in this effort by
a broad coalition of more than 100 privacy, civil liberties, civil rights and tech industry leaders
from across the political spectrum in supporting the privacy updates contained in this bill.”
"Reforming ECPA to protect legitimate privacy rights is not a partisan issue," said Senator Lee. "I'm pleased to be working closely with Chairman Leahy to help ensure that all Americans can be confident that the government may not access their email or other electronic communications without a warrant."
The Leahy-Lee Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2013 establishes a search warrant requirement in order for the government to obtain the content of Americans’ emails and other electronic communications, when those communications are stored with a third-party service provider. The bill eliminates the outdated “180-day” rule that calls for different legal standards for the government to obtain email content depending upon the age of an email, and it requires that the government notify an individual whose electronic communications have been disclosed within 10 days  of obtaining a search warrant.  The Committee also on Thursday adopted two amendments to the bill; a technical amendment offered by Chairman Leahy to clarify the rule of construction, and an amendment from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) requiring the Comptroller General to conduct a review of the use of the law.
ECPA reform was the subject of two Committee hearings in recent years, and the Senate Judiciary Committee last November favorably reported legislation substantially similar to the Leahy-Lee bill.  In January, Leahy said that updating ECPA was his top privacy priority for the 113th Congress.
“When I led the effort to write ECPA 27 years ago, email was a novelty,” said Leahy.  “Three decades later, we must update this law, so that the law protects our privacy rights and keeps pace with innovation and the challenging mission of law enforcement.  I look forward to the Senate now considering this important legislation.”
Satement of Senator Mike Lee (R-UT),
Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
On Committee Consideration of the
Electronic Commications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2013
Updating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act is an essential step to protect Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights.  Chairman Leahy led the original effort to pass ECPA back in 1986, and I am very happy to join with him here to provide these essential updates.  For centuries, Americans sent some of their most personal correspondence to each other through the U.S. Postal Service.  It is well settled that government agencies should not have warrantless access to such private correspondence.
Modern technology has evolved to the point where third party storage and “cloud computing” are now the norm.  Many people use Google, Yahoo, and other remote services to host and coordinate electronic communications.   Due to the conflicts of older legislation and modern technology, private email correspondence over 180 days old is not afforded full Fourth Amendment protection.  Today, we finally move to change that.
Even the Department of Justice sees the need for this.  In its March 19, 2013 testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy said that there is “no principled basis to treat email less than 180 days old differently than email more than 180 days old.”  Later on, referring to a theory that emails may lose warrant protection as soon as they are opened, the Department added, “Similarly, it makes sense that the statute not accord lesser protection to opened emails than it gives to emails that are unopened.”
Our bill prohibits an electronic communications or remote computing service provider—like Gmail or Facebook or Twitter—from voluntarily disclosing the contents of customer emails or other communications.  It eliminates the ambiguous and outdated “180 day rule” that some government agencies believe grants them warrantless access to the content of older emails.  Instead, all requests for the content of electronic communications would require a search warrant based on probable cause.  And law enforcement agencies would be required to notify, within 10 days, any persons whose email accounts are searched, subject to standard exceptions.
The Leahy-Lee ECPA Amendments Act of 2013 is truly bipartisan in nature.  It enjoys broad support from the technology industry, privacy advocates, constitutional scholars, and policy groups on both ends of the ideological spectrum.  I’m grateful to Chairman Leahy’s leadership on this issue and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.

Title: Lee Delivers Remarks at Comprehensive Immigration Reform Hearing
Date: April 19, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered the following remarks at the first Senate Judiciary hearing on comprehensive immigration reform legislation:
Virtually everyone agrees that our immigration system is broken and needs to be reformed.  For far too long we have made it comparatively easy for people to cross our borders and stay here illegally, and comparatively hard for those who seek to immigrate to our country through established, legal channels.
But solving our immigration woes isn’t simple or straightforward.  We don’t face just one big immigration challenge.  It is a complex puzzle with dozens of interconnected pieces.  And just like the puzzles we all put together as children, some of the pieces can’t be incorporated until others are already in place.
Given this unavoidable reality, it’s clear we are not going to be able to fix our entire immigration system overnight.  Nor could we hope to analyze and discuss even a small fraction of the most critical issues in one or two hearings before this Committee.  The process of reform will have to be considered and implemented in stages and over the course of many years.
Clearly, the challenges we face are hard and will take time to address.  So it is all the more important that we begin in earnest immediately.  I applaud the efforts of my colleagues who have worked hard to develop the proposal before us today.  Theirs has been an enormous undertaking and I appreciate their dedication to making progress toward lasting reform.
Today, I look forward to discussing a few key issues that are part of the enormous immigration puzzle.  I have introduced several pieces of immigration reform legislation, at least one of which has been incorporated into the bill we’re discussing today.  But at the outset I must express two primary concerns with the current bill and with this Committee’s current path.
First, like many Americans, I am wary of trying to do this all in one fell swoop.  Good policy never flows from massive bills that seek to fix every problem in a single, sweeping piece of legislation.  Few legislators—and perhaps fewer citizens—actually understand everything in such bills.  And no one can even pretend to comprehend all the moving pieces and likely results.  Such wide-ranging legislation inevitably produces unforeseen effects and unintended consequences.
Especially when it comes to our immigration system, some reforms are necessary prerequisites for other, subsequent reforms.  It makes little sense to make decisions about later stages before the essential foundations are even in place.  It’s like trying to put the roof on a new house before raising the walls that will hold it up.  In particular, this bill seeks to address the 11 million before other preconditions are actually satisfied—so it treats the 11 million as if they’re a single, monolithic group, all here for the same reasons, which they are not.
Trying to resolve every issue, all at once, is also politically problematic.  There is broad consensus on some necessary reforms, but others are highly controversial.   We ought not hijack commonsense and essential measures by linking them to unavoidably contentious ones.
My second concern is with the Committee’s process thus far.  Reforms of this magnitude and importance deserve more than a couple of hastily scheduled hearings.  This bill was not made available until Wednesday morning.  It totals 844 pages of complicated legislative text with dozens of component parts.  Given the unusually—and unnecessarily—compressed schedule, there has been no real opportunity for Senators, staff, or hearing witnesses to read—let alone understand and digest—the substance of the bill.
There is no way that we as a Committee could possibly be prepared this morning to debate more than a fraction of this massive bill.  It would be impossible to have a meaningful discussion with rigorous analysis under such circumstances.  Witnesses were asked to submit written testimony before they could have conceivably read the entire bill.  And even with the help of committed staff who have worked through the night in preparation, none of us can honestly say that we understand each provision or how all the pieces fit together.  Not even close.
Immigration reform is far too complex and far too important to be rushed though Committee without informed discussion and serious debate.  A hearing just two days after receiving voluminous legislative text is completely inadequate for the American people to get answers to the many questions that such far-reaching reforms will inevitably raise.  I hope and trust that the Chairman—encouraged by the bill’s authors who sit on this Committee—will commit to hold a series of substantive hearings after Members have had sufficient time to read, understand, and begin to assess all the provisions under consideration.  The American people deserve nothing less than an open and honest process.
Having expressed these concerns, let me reiterate that I support fundamental reform of our immigration system.  I believe we have an historic opportunity to make progress on a number of key issues where there is broad consensus.  Such real and concrete progress shouldn’t be sacrificed to demands that we address every challenge at once, or that we seek to resolve the most contentious problems first.
That’s why I favor a sensible, incremental approach.  Republicans and Democrats share much common ground on many of the most immediate issues.  On essential elements like border security, employment verification, visa reform, guest worker programs, and high-skilled immigration to meet America’s economic needs, we are largely in agreement and could enact significant reforms.  We shouldn’t delay meaningful progress in these areas just because we have differences in a few others.
Still, each of these issues is complex and we should have robust and substantive debate over the best way to structure each such reform.  I look forward to beginning that discussion today.

Title: Lee Delivers Remarks on Electronic Communications Privacy Act
Date: April 18, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered the following remarks in a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting regarding the bipartisan Electronic Communications Privacy Amendments Act of 2013 (ECPA). Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Senator Lee are co-sponsors of the legislation.
In 1986, Chairman Leahy led the effort to enact the Electronic Communications Privacy Act—an important law that ensured government agencies would respect the Fourth Amendment in accessing an individual’s electronic communications.  In the nearly three decades since ECPA became law, technology has advanced rapidly.  The prevalence of email and the low cost of electronic data storage have made what were once robust protections insufficient to ensure that citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights are adequately protected.
As we witnessed recently with the Internal Revenue Service—which had in some cases advised agency officials that they did not need a warrant to access private emails that are more than 180 days old—these concerns are more than theoretical.  For this reason, I have worked together in bipartisan fashion with Chairman Leahy to introduce much-needed and commonsense updates to ECPA.
Our bill prohibits an electronic communications or remote computing service provider—like Gmail or Facebook or Twitter—from voluntarily disclosing the contents of customer emails or other communications.  It eliminates the ambiguous and outdated “180 day rule” that some government agencies believe grants them warrantless access to the content of older emails.  Instead, all requests for the content of electronic communications would require a search warrant based on probable cause.  And law enforcement agencies would be required to notify, within 10 days, any persons whose email accounts are searched, subject to some logical exceptions.
This legislation is also carefully crafted so that it does not act as a serious impediment to the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations.  Routing information, customer names, session time records, and other non-content information will still be available through subpoenas.  The bill also contains a rule of construction allowing government access to internal corporate email when the communications are to or from an officer, agent, or employee of a company and the company is acting as the electronic communications service provider for its own internal email system.
The Leahy-Lee ECPA Amendments Act of 2013 is truly bipartisan in nature.  It enjoys broad support from the technology industry, privacy advocates, constitutional scholars, and policy groups on both ends of the ideological spectrum.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.

Title: Lee Statement on Gun Bill Votes
Date: April 17, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding the votes relating to the firearms bill (S.649):
“Following the tragedy at Sandy Hook, we all wanted to find answers that would reduce crime and prevent the next senseless act of violence. Unfortunately, the Senate did not consider any proposals that would achieve these objectives.  Instead, the primary effect of most of the bills we voted on today, including the expansion of background checks, was to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens.
“I agree with the president that this debate is not over.  My hope is that we can now discuss the problems that lead to these violent acts and propose solutions that actually address them.  We can do more to identify and help individuals with mental health issues and enforce existing laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals.  We must also begin a serious dialogue about the culture of violence that undermines the moral fabric of our society.
“We have an obligation to protect the lives and liberty of Americans.  I am confident that we can achieve both.”

Title: Lee Statement on Release of Immigration Bill
Date: April 16, 2013

Content:
“As of this afternoon, senators have received only a set of talking points promoting the new immigration proposal. Once it has been released, I strongly encourage my colleagues to read the bill and then decide for themselves whether this reform will accomplish what proponents are promising.  It is unfortunate that we have so little time to digest and evaluate such an expansive piece of legislation before we hold our initial committee hearing.  As senators, it is our duty to read the bill and fully understand the impact it will have on our immigration system before casting votes.”

Title: Lee Signs Letter Condemning IRS Warrantless Searches
Date: April 16, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (UT) joined several of his colleagues in sending a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), condemning their practice of accessing citizens’ private electronic communications, including emails, without a warrant.  He released the following statement:
“The contents of private email communications are currently subject to an outdated privacy protection regime, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).  ECPA was enacted in 1986 and no longer serves the realities of modern Internet technology.  As a result of antiquated provisions of this law, the IRS improperly believes it is entitled to warrantless access to the contents of Americans’ emails, so long as such communications are more than 180 days old.
“I believe this approach is a clear violation of Fourth Amendment rights, and now is the time to update ECPA to protect Americans.  The Leahy-Lee ECPA Amendments Act of 2013 brings the law up to date and is consistent with the rest of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  It mandates that government agencies show probable cause and obtain warrants to view the contents of private email communication, no matter how old the messages are.
“I appreciated today’s Senate Finance Committee testimony of IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller, which indicated that the IRS would update its policies and establish a warrant requirement.  I am still concerned that both the IRS manual and recently uncovered IRS documents do not reflect these views.  As we wait for legislative developments, I concur with my colleagues that the IRS should immediately establish a warrant requirement for its searches and seizures of email and other electronic personal correspondence.  Additionally, we are asking the IRS to provide a timeline for updating its manuals, opinions and other forms of guidance to reflect this change.”

Title: Lee, Paul, Cruz: Senate to Vote on Gun Bill No One Has Read
Date: April 11, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Mike Lee (UT), Rand Paul (KY) and Ted Cruz (TX) released the following statement regarding the pending vote on the motion to proceed to new gun control legislation:
“This morning the Senate will vote on the motion to proceed to the firearms bill (S.649). It is expected that the Toomey-Manchin provision announced yesterday will replace the current language regarding background checks. Yet, as of this morning, not a single senator has been provided the legislative language of this provision.  Because the background-check measure is the centerpiece of this legislation it is critical that we know what is in the bill before we vote on it.  The American people expect more and deserve better.
“Unfortunately, the effort to push through legislation that no one had read highlights one of the primary reasons we announced our intention to force a 60 vote threshold.  We believe the abuse of the process is how the rights of Americans are systematically eroded and we will continue to do everything in our power to prevent it.”

Title: Lee: "Don't the American people deserve to know what we are voting on?"
Date: April 11, 2013

Content:
Mr,President, yesterday on the floor I discussed an initiative I launched called “Protect2A” to give a voice to the millions of Second Amendment supporters who are very concerned about Congress enacting any new gun control measures.
I am pleased to announce that we now have over 3000 responses from citizens all across this country who are sharing their stories, experiences, and opinions about why they feel we should do everything in our power to protect their Second Amendment rights.
I only had a brief time to share some of those stories yesterday, so I’d like to use some of my time today to share a few more:
Kathy

My husband and I are senior citizens - he is a veteran of the U.S Army. Over the past several years, we have seen our constitutional rights trampled and twisted, until we know longer trust that our government has our well-being as it's primary concern. Last year, for the first time in our lives, we bought a gun, not only to ensure our safety against criminals, but to protect and defend our God given rights as citizens. The most basic right of all mankind, the right-to-life itself, no longer exists in this country. Protecting our rights, the few the government has left us, is of the utmost importance to us and we will do anything necessary to hold onto those rights, regardless of the source of the threats against them. God Bless America!!!
Emily
Pennsylvania
I am 19 years old and I want to protect myself as soon as I am legal to. As a young female living in Allentown, PA, I don't like walking in the city because I'm afraid of something happening to me. I believe in the power of the Constitution and especially my 2nd Amendment rights. I am a strong conservative who believes that the Constitution is our guiding power and not the cronyism that seems to blanket DC. The founding fathers knew what they were doing! As soon as I am legal I want to take gun safety classes and purchase a handgun of my very own. I like to think that I can protect my own life as well as another person whose life may be in danger. Gun control doesn't solve anything. Criminals will get guns no matter what. I want to be able to protect myself as well as someone else's. Please don't take away my 2nd Amendment rights!
William
Connecticut
On Tuesday, Feb. 11 2003, my brother was confronted by 3 armed thugs in a parking lot. Out of their stolen car, with a stolen shotgun they tried to rob him.  Much to their surprise my brother had his legally owned pistol (with a legal carry permit).  He thwarted this [attack] and saved his own life and held them at bay until police arrived. Without the 2
nd
Amendment he would've been another victim to the growing street crime that these bills DO NOT ADDRESS !
You see, Mr. President, these are the rights we are trying to protect by requiring a 60 vote threshold on any new gun control legislation.  And in doing so, we are trying to prevent the ability of members to push through legislation before anyone has had time to read and evaluate the language and then tell the American people exactly what this means for their rights.
Unfortunately, that is what we are faced with today.  Yesterday, Senators Toomey and Manchin announced a new proposal that is widely expected to replace the current language on background checks in this bill. Yet, as of this morning, not a single senator has been provided the legislative language of this provision.  Because the background check measure is the centerpiece of this legislation it is critical that we know what is in the bill before we vote on it.
As I have argued on this floor, in the national media, and back home in Utah, we should not be legislating by using closed door, back room deals away from the eyes of the American people.  We should not be voting before we understand exactly how these proposals will affect the rights of law abiding citizens and whether we can say with any level of certainty that they will reduce crime.
This is exactly why we need more debate and why I ask my colleagues to vote no on cloture – so senators and the American people can fully understand the consequences of this legislation.
Add your voice to protect the 2nd Amendment here

Title: Lee: Timing of Immigration Hearing “Completely Inadequate”
Date: April 10, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced that the Senate Judiciary Committee’s lone hearing on the Gang of Eight’s comprehensive immigration reform legislation will take place next Wednesday, despite the fact that the Gang has yet to release any language or even any summary of their bill.  In response, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement:
“A single hearing scheduled so quickly to discuss legislative language that is not yet even available is completely inadequate for Senators or the American people to get answers to the many questions a bill of this magnitude will inevitably raise.  We could not possibly have a meaningful hearing with a substantive discussion of what will surely be over 1,000 pages of provisions we haven't even yet seen.”
“I have urged Senator Leahy to allow members of the Committee sufficient time to review any comprehensive immigration bill and to hold hearings on the numerous issues that have evolved since the Committee last considered comprehensive immigration reform more than five years ago.  Many topics are ripe for serious discussion, including the changing demographics of Mexico and other sources of illegal immigration, the effect of a new guest worker program on the economy, the metrics DHS will use to measure border security, and the long-term costs of mass naturalization.
“Our immigration system is in need of reform and I am enormously disappointed that my colleagues are looking to rush another thousand-page bill through the Senate.  This is not how important, sweeping changes should be made.”

Title: Senator Lee Shares Voices of American Citizens Who Want to Protect 2nd Amendment
Date: April 10, 2013

Content:
The President has spent several weeks evoking the tragedy at Sandy Hook and highlighting the voices of the victims in an effort to promote his gun control proposals.  But he has not explained to the American people how any of his new gun control measures would have prevented that or any other terrible tragedy or reduced gun violence in any measurable way.
Instead, his proposals would serve to primarily restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens.
Recently, I have launched a project I call “Protect2A” in an attempt to reach out to those who do not want to see changes to our Bill of Rights and believe members of Congress should be doing everything in their power to protect the Second Amendment rights of citizens.
I am pleased to announce that the response to “Protect2A” has been overwhelming.  In less than two days we have received well over 1000 responses on my website.  The vast majority of them recognize that the president’s proposals will not make them safer, but will only result in limiting their rights as law-abiding citizens.
It is with this in mind that I would now like to ensure that their voices become an important part of this debate.  I have several quotes from Americans across the country who oppose these measures and want senators to stand up for them and their constitutional rights:
Roger - Utah
As a veteran, I've had too many "brothers" and "sisters" make sacrifices to uphold the Constitution of the US. Their blood will not be in vain. While I believe our rights are not granted by government, I believe the documentation of these rights in the US Constitution has helped us maintain our freedoms. Why is the 2nd Amendment important to me? Because without it, the rest of our rights can simply be wiped away. Thank you for what you are doing.
Jim – Louisiana
I lived through the Los Angeles riots. My wife and I were living in Silver Lake. For 5 days we watched the orange glow of businesses being burned on two sides. For 5 days we never saw a law enforcement officer. We were on our own. My wife and I were unarmed. The couple across the street had a pair of shotguns and the elderly gentleman next to them had a .38 service revolver from his days in the LAPD. After it became clear that law enforcement had abandoned the citizens of Los Angels, we took shifts watching the street and who was coming and going. Our neighbors brought us coffee in the middle of the night, a night that was lit with the flames of burning buildings. Twice cars came up our street, saw us armed and turned around. I have no doubt that the drivers had things on their minds other than getting home to loved ones. As soon as I could, I went out and bought my first handgun.
I will not be disarmed. I will not be a victim. And I will not let my boys be victims. Legal or not, I'm giving them my guns as they get mature enough to use them. If our government is so out of touch that they will make law abiding citizens criminals, it's just something my family will have to deal with. But we will not disarm.
David – Missouri
I am a handicapped 78year old male living alone. I have applied for and received a conceal carry permit, which I feel is my Second Amendment Right, I hope and pray, that I never have to use my firearm, but will if challenged to do so.
Please don't treat the Subject of the Second Amendment like you
did with my health care, by passing legislation that you didn't even read
Carolyn – New Jersey
protection of the 2A is necessary in order to preserve the integrity of our constitution. the 'ruling elite' cannot pick and choose which amendments they like, and which they don't. we the people are sovereign citizens, and we are protected by the constitution
Annie – Georgia
Dear Senator, how I wish we as a civilized Nation did not had to go thru this in order to defend our 2nd Amendment that has been in place for all this past years. It is very important that we the citizens keep our weapons to be able to defend ourselves from criminals as well as to send a message to the government that we are not under any dictatorship, we are a free country and we are ready to defend our position against anyone who tries to take away what rights we have. To me personally my guns are my defense to protect my family, and I have had to make use of them for that reason in the past, and will do it again since the police can not be available fast enough... Please protect our rights because once we loose this Amendment, we are defenseless and the others will follow. I do not want to live again in a country where the citizens have no "voice", where there is no democracy and the people live in fear of what they say. I am a legal citizen of the USA, by choice! I am an American, and I love this country like my own. Thanks so much for what you are doing, let our voices be heard!
Mr. President, I have only read a handful of the responses, but I have several dozen of them that I would like to submit into the Congressional record, so that when future senators, historians, researchers, and the American people look back at this debate we are having, the voice of those who called on Congress to protect the Second Amendment and defend the Bill of Rights had a prominent place in our discussion today.  I ask unanimous consent to submit this list of responses for the record.
Thank you.

Title: Lee: We have no intention of preventing debate or votes on gun control bills
Date: April 10, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a speech on the Senate floor reaffirming the need to
protect the second amendment
. The full text of the speech is available below:
"For several weeks now, Washington and the rest of the country have been
debating several new gun control proposals
.  Along with a number of my colleagues, including the Minority Leader, I have declared my intention to resist an immediate vote on any new restrictions that would serve primarily to limit the freedoms of law-abiding citizens rather than reduce violent crime.
"Unfortunately, the current gun control proposals would do just that. More than two weeks ago, we informed the Majority Leader that we will exercise our procedural right to require a 60-vote threshold in order to bring this legislation to the floor.  We have done this for three reasons:
"First, the Senate serves an important function in our republic by encouraging deliberation and making it more difficult for a temporary majority to impose its will unilaterally.  Unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate's rules and procedures allow for meaningful debate and help ensure that a bare majority of Senators do not impose controversial legislation on the American people without robust debate, discussion and broad-based consensus.
"Contrary to the statements made by the president and my friends across the aisle, and even a few in my own caucus, we have no intention of preventing debate or votes.
"Quite the opposite.  By objecting to the motion to proceed, we guarantee that the Senate and the American people have at least three additional days to assess and evaluate exactly how this particular bill will affect the rights of law-abiding citizens and whether it will have any significant impact on crime.
"Already we have seen consensus against passing any new gun legislation – at least not without broad bipartisan support.
"During the recent budget debate, I offered an amendment to establish a two-thirds requirement for the passage of any new gun legislation.   Six Democratic senators voted with a nearly united Republican caucus to support my amendment by a vote of 50 to 49.
"This vote demonstrated that a majority of Senators, including at least six Democrats, believe that new gun legislation should have broad bipartisan support in the Senate before it becomes law.
"A 60 vote threshold will help ensure that new gun laws aren't forced through the Senate with the narrow support of just one party.
"Second, this debate is about more than magazine clips and pistol grips.  It is about the purpose of the Second Amendment and why our constitutionally protected right to self-defense is an essential part of self-government.
"At its core, the Second Amendment helps ensure that individuals and local communities can serve as the first line of defense against threats to our persons and property.  Any limitation on this fundamental right of self-defense makes us more dependent on government for protection.  But government can’t be everywhere at all times, so the practical effect of limiting our individual rights is to make us less safe.
"This is deeply troubling to many Americans.  Any legislation that would restrict our basic right to self-defense deserves serious and open debate.
"Further, as we have seen just today, Washington prefers to negotiate back room deals made in secret far from the eyes of the American people, rather than engaging in thorough, open, and transparent debate on the Senate floor.
"The day before the Majority Leader has set the vote to proceed to the bill we have no idea what the bill will ultimately look like, no legislative text to evaluate the so-called compromise language on background checks, and no sense of what amendments, if any, might be allowed.
"Requiring a 60-vote threshold helps ensure that we have a meaningful debate rather than a series of back-room deals to push such controversial legislation through Congress with a bare majority.
"Finally, many of the provision we expect to see in the bill are both constitutionally problematic and serve primarily to limit the freedoms of law-abiding citizens.  Some of the proposals—like universal background checks—would allow the federal government to surveil law-abiding citizens who exercise their constitutional rights.
"One of the provisions of this bill which we saw in committee, would allow the Attorney General to promulgate regulations that could lead to a national registry system for guns – something my constituents in Utah are very concerned about.
"The federal government has no business monitoring where and how often you go to church; what books and newspapers you read; who you vote for; your health conditions; and the details of your private life—including your lawful exercise of Second Amendment rights.
"Such limitations may at times make it harder for the government. But
the Constitution was not written to maximize government convenience
. It was written to protect individual liberty.
"We must not narrow the application of constitutional protections in haste; nor should we allow a bare majority to jeopardize basic rights of the American people.
"The Senate — and the American people — are engaged in an important debate today.  I look forward to this debate and hope that others join me and my colleagues in demanding that our discussions take place in full view of the American people."

Title: Lee: We Have Been Voting On and Debating Guns for Weeks
Date: April 9, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today,
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) shot back against misleading claims by President Obama and top congressional Democrats that Republicans are blocking votes or debate on new gun control legislation.
“The Senate has been debating and voting on new gun legislation for weeks,” said Lee. “Congress, the president, the press, and the public have been debating the merits of stricter gun control from kitchen tables to cables news shows since the tragedy at Sandy Hook. Op-Ed pages, Facebook timelines and Twitter feeds are loaded with discussion about the Second Amendment and the proper response to the problem of gun violence in this country.
“More than a month ago, the Judiciary Committee heard hours of testimony and debate on several different gun control proposals.  And we voted on them.
“Just recently, 50 senators, including six Democrats, voted to require a supermajority to pass any new gun legislation.
“If the president believes there have been no votes or debate on gun control in recent weeks, I’d ask him to take note of what is going on in the country.
“Our effort to require a 60 vote threshold is an attempt to facilitate greater debate about the specific piece of legislation that will come to the Senate floor.  By objecting to the motion to proceed, we guarantee that the Senate and the American people have at least three additional days to assess and evaluate exactly how this particular bill will affect the rights of law-abiding citizens and whether it will have any significant impact on crime.
“The president again is trying to rush legislation through Congress because he knows that as Americans begin to find out what is in the bill, they will oppose it.  Our job in Congress is to do everything in our power to ensure the public understands these bills and how they affect their rights as citizens.”

Title: Lee Praises Momentum for Protecting Second Amendment Rights, Launches #Protect2A
Date: April 8, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee lauded the growing support in the Senate for protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.  Thirteen senators have now signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announcing they will object to any new gun legislation that restricts the rights of Americans or leads to government surveillance of constitutionally protected activity.
“The more people learn about the consequences of current gun control proposals, the less they will support the new restrictions,” said Sen. Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The proposals serve primarily to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens, while doing little – if anything – to reduce violent crimes. Senators have an obligation both to uphold the Constitution and to promote solutions that effectively address national problems. The current gun control proposals fail both tests.”
A recent national poll showed a 10 percent
drop in the number of Americans who support additional gun control
.  Just 47% support greater gun restrictions, while 50% of the country wants to keep the laws the same or make them less strict.
Two weeks ago, Senators Lee, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Ted Cruz of Texas announced their intention to force a 60-vote threshold to consider any new gun legislation.  They have been joined by Senators Rubio, Inhofe, Moran, Burr, Johnson, Enzi, Risch, Crapo, Coats, and Roberts.  A copy of the letter with the updated signatures can be seen below.
“We believe that any new restrictions on gun rights should require a bipartisan majority. The American people deserve a meaningful and transparent debate about gun laws before those who seek further Second Amendment restrictions use procedural tricks and back-room deals to push through controversial legislation,” Lee added.
Senator Lee also announced his effort to reach out to the American people and get their opinions on the new gun measures.  His “Protect2A” project will allow more Americans to have their voices heard through his website and several social media outlets.
“Americans know the true meaning and purpose of the Second Amendment is to guarantee our right to self-defense in our system of self-government.  We’re asking citizens to share their stories about what the Second Amendment means to them and why they feel the Senate should protect their rights,” explained Lee.

Title: Lee Opposes UN Arms Trade Treaty
Date: April 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee cosponsored S. Con. Res 7, a resolution expressing opposition to the
United Nations Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT).  The treaty contains several troubling provisions that could prevent the United States from coming to the aid of its closest allies, as well as limit the constitutional rights of Americans.  Senator Lee was the 34th cosponsor of the resolution introduced by Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, which gives the opposition more than enough votes in the Senate to block ratification of the treaty.
“The United Nations Arms Trade Treaty is deeply flawed, which is why a majority of senators recently voted to stop the administration from continuing to push it,” said Senator Lee. “ I have great concerns that this treaty can be used to violate the second amendment rights of American citizens, and do not believe we should sign any treaty that infringes on the sovereignty of our country.  I am pleased to join 34 of my colleagues in signaling to this administration that the UN-ATT is a non-starter in the senate.”

Title: Lee Responds to President’s Call to Restrict Gun Rights
Date: March 28, 2013

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to the president’s speech calling for increased restrictions on the rights of law-abiding citizens:
“The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It is deeply unfortunate that he continues to use the tragedy at Newtown as a backdrop for pushing legislation that would have done nothing to prevent that horrible crime.”
“Along with my colleagues Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, I have informed the Majority Leader that we will exercise our procedural right to require a 60-vote threshold in order to bring any of the president’s proposals to the floor.  We have done this for three reasons:
“First, as we saw last week with a vote on my amendment to establish a two-thirds requirement for the passage of any new gun legislation, virtually all Republicans and at least
six Democrats believe that new gun legislation should have overwhelming bipartisan support
in the Senate before it becomes law.
“Second, this debate is about more than magazine clips and pistol grips. It is about the purpose of the Second Amendment and why our constitutionally protected right to self-defense is an essential part of self-government. Any legislation that would restrict our basic right to self-defense deserves robust and open debate.  Requiring a 60-vote threshold helps ensure that we have that debate rather than skipping directly to the back room deals, horse trading, and business-as-usual politics that typifies the way Congress passes legislation today.
“Finally, many of the current gun proposals are constitutionally problematic.  Altering the application of constitutional protections should require approval by a supermajority of Congress.  With a 60-vote threshold, we are seeking to ensure that a bare majority does not jeopardize the basic rights of the American people.
“The Senate — and the American people — have an important debate ahead of us.  I look forward to this debate and hope that others Senators join me, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz in demanding that our discussions take place in full view of the American people.”

Title: Lee Gets Vote on Amendment to Increase PILT Payments
Date: March 23, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) received a vote on his amendment to ensure that Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) payments are roughly equivalent to the lost property tax revenues. The amendment passed in a voice vote.
The federal government owns almost two thirds of the land in Utah. Unlike other property owners, the federal government does not pay property taxes on the land that it owns.  As a result, areas with high concentrations of federal land face budget shortfalls.  The federal government created the PILT program to provide some funding to these affected jurisdictions, but this funding is woefully inadequate.
“Counties that have substantial amounts of federal land suffer financially from having a reduced property tax base,” said Senator Lee.  “The federal Payment in Lieu of Taxes program was established to compensate local governments  for the tax revenue lost due to the presence of federal land.  Unfortunately, PILT payments tend to be a small fraction of what the local governments could generate through property taxes, which results in underfunded school, infrastructure, and other community services.  We can correct the damage caused by this unfair system by requiring PILT payments to be roughly equivalent to the actual lost property tax revenue.”

Title: Lee Gets Vote on Amendment to Protect National Security from Dangerous Debt
Date: March 23, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Tonight, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) received a vote on his amendment to create a point of order against considering any budget where outlays for net interest payments on the debt exceed outlays for national defense in any year of the budget window. The motion failed in a vote of 53 to 46.
“Our national debt should not continue to grow at such a level that the cost of servicing the debt cripples the real, Constitutionally obligated duties of government,” said Senator Lee. “This point of order would have drawn a line in the sand, saying that we should not simply accept budgets where our debt grows so large that the cost of interest, much of which is going to China, exceeds the cost of defense. Fixing our spending problem and getting our debt under control will not only keep America solvent, but also secure."

Title: Lee Offers Amendment to Protect 2nd Amendment Rights
Date: March 23, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senate Democrats blocked a vote today on an amendment offered by Senator Lee (R-UT) to create a budget point of order against any future legislation that restricts the rights of Americans to own a firearm.  This amendment re-affirmed the importance of the 2nd Amendment.  It also requires that additional consideration should be given before passing legislation that alters one of our fundamental constitutional rights.
This legislation would apply to the following examples:
Bans on so called “assault weapons”
Bans on high capacity magazines
Universal background checks that can only be enforced by a national registry
Establishment of a registry to track firearm purchases
Imposing a de facto ban on gun sales to veterans
This point of order could be waived by a 2/3 majority of the Senate.
"Americans are appalled by criminal acts of mass violence,” Sen. Lee said.  “However, Americans also recognize that there are limits to the problems that can be solved with new legislation.  The 2nd Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens’ rights to defend their own life, the lives of their loved ones, and the lives of the most vulnerable.  This right speaks to history’s lesson that government cannot be in all places at all times, and history’s warning that we would not like to live under a government that tried.  Government registration of firearms presents a threat to our 2nd Amendment rights.  Such a registry would be no less offensive than one monitoring how individual citizens exercise their rights to free speech, association, religion, or any other constitutional right.”

Title: Lee Applauds Senate for Debating a Budget
Date: March 22, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – The United States Senate is famously referred to as the “world’s greatest deliberative body.”  For the first time in four years, this great institution will live up to its reputation, as it moves to debate a federal budget.  The budget is the one bill every year to which any Senator can offer an amendment on almost any topic.  “I am glad we all have this opportunity to introduce amendments that reflect the concerns and priorities of our constituents,” said Lee.  “I look forward to staying as long as necessary to ensure that each senator can participate in this process, and I hope the Senate can become a body where this kind of debate happens more frequently.”
Senator Lee has prepared several amendments that he plans to introduce as part of this budget resolution.  Here is a sampling of amendments that Lee plans to introduce:
Amendment #522: An amendment to determine the sense of the Senate on whether we should adopt a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to send to the states for ratification.
The first budget that we have debated in four years should primarily focus on improving of the nation’s fiscal imbalance.  This amendment would measure support in the Senate for enacting the structural spending reform that is necessary to restore our country to a sustainable fiscal path.
“Although the Democrats call their budget a balanced approach, American families and business owners recognize that there is nothing balanced about a budget that spends more money than is available,” said Lee.  “Two years ago several of my Democratic colleagues recognized the need for a balanced budget amendment.  Our financial situation has only worsened since this time, so it is time for the Senate to recognize the need for permanent structural spending reform”
Amendment #443:  An amendment to establish reasonable deadlines for processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
Lee’s amendment would prevent the NEPA delays that are costing us jobs and economic growth.  A recent study of 20 projects on federal land in the West indicated that unreasonable and interminable NEPA delays are costing the United States more than $380 billion dollars.
“States like Utah have demonstrated that it is possible to complete a thorough analysis of environmental risks in a reasonable amount of time,” said Lee.  “Our struggling economy can’t afford the uncertainty and excessive costs associated with a sluggish and unresponsive federal government.  We can still protect the environment with a NEPA process that sets clear and reasonable deadlines.”
Amendment #444: An amendment to eliminate funding to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the listing, management, and enforcement of regulations relating to the Greater and Gunnison Sage Grouse.
Lee’s Amendment would eliminate funding for listing two sage grouse species under the Endangered Species Act.  Individual states in the West have already offered mitigation plans to responsibly protect the Greater Sage Grouse, and the same could be done with the Gunnison Sage Grouse.   As the need for prioritizing the federal budget increases, the federal government shouldn’t be spending money to manage species that the states are already able and willing to protect.
“Any time a species is listed under the Endangered Species Act, economic activity is threatened,” said Lee.  “It is common for these listings to result in restrictions of private property use, job losses, and the prevention of responsible development of natural resources.  Cattle ranchers and farmers are also burdened, which threatens rural economies and increases the price of food.  As states increase their ability to manage and protect species like the Greater and Gunnison Sage Grouse, we should rely on them to do so.”
Amendment #445: An amendment to eliminate funding to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the management and enforcement of regulations related to the Utah Prairie Dog.
Listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, the Utah Prairie Dog thrives in certain places in Utah – causing property damage to cemeteries, airports, and golf courses.  Lee’s Amendment would prevent the federal government from interfering with state and local efforts to effectively manage this species.
“The Utah Prairie Dog is a great example of the failure of the Endangered Species Act to appropriately balance human welfare and the protection of the species,” said Lee.  “Americans agree that protecting wildlife is an important effort, but a federal regulation has gone too far when it doesn’t allow for the relocation of an animal that is burrowing through the remains of someone’s dead ancestors.  My amendment will enable state, county, and city officials in Utah to effectively manage this species.”
Amendment #521: An Amendment to ensure funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program is at least roughly equivalent to the actual lost property tax revenues due to the presence of federal land.
“Counties that have substantial amounts of federal land suffer financially from having a reduced property tax base,” said Lee.  “The federal Payment in Lieu of Taxes program was established to compensate local entities for the tax revenue lost due to the presence of federal land.  Unfortunately, PILT payments tend to be a small fraction of what the local entities could generate through property taxes, which results in underfunded schools, infrastructure, and other community services.  We can correct the damage caused by this unfair system by requiring PILT payments to be roughly equivalent to the actual lost property tax revenue.”
Amendment #252: The DC Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection amendment expresses that it is the sense of the senate that there is substantial medical evidence that unborn children experience pain by at least 20 weeks after fertilization.
It also establishes that Congress should enact legislation that would make it unlawful within the District of Columbia to perform an abortion of unborn children after that point in time that they will feel pain and suffer from that procedure.
“There is substantial medical evidence that unborn children experience pain by at least 20 weeks of development,” said Lee.  “Congress has the responsibility to protect the lives of the most vulnerable among us.  My amendment would protect unborn children from painful abortion procedures, while creating exceptions when the life of the mother is jeopardized.”
Amendment 253: An Amendment to remove the per-country caps for employment-based green cards, allowing companies to recruit, hire, and retain the best and brightest the world has to offer.
Congress should take whatever actions it can to ensure that our legal immigration system can meet the needs of our nation.  This reform would also increase the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent.  Without adding new green cards such a bill would create a “first-come, first-served” system that would alleviate the backlogs and allow green cards to be awarded more efficiently.
“Our immigration system presents dozens of challenges. But there is bipartisan agreement on many of these areas, so we should not delay progress in these areas just because we have differences in other areas. This amendment will allow business owners to recruit employees based on their abilities rather than their country of origin.  America has always been – and must remain – a magnet for the world’s best and brightest. This amendment would open the door to these individuals, which would result in an increase in both economic growth, opportunity, and competitiveness."

Title: Lee Votes "No" on Jewell Nomination
Date: March 21, 2013

Content:
During a mark-up for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Lee voted "No" on the nomination of Sally Jewell as the next Secretary of the Department of the Interior.  He made the following statement to explain his vote against Ms. Jewell:
The Secretary of the Interior exercises enormous influence and power over the daily lives of Utahns. The decisions made at the Department of the Interior impact our economy and citizens in significant ways.  These decisions determine whether families can continue to use roads to reach hunting areas that have been used for generations or whether ranchers can continue to graze cattle on land that they have used for decades.  The department's policies also dramatically impact whether communities will have the necessary resources to fund schools and other local priorities. The Secretary's sweeping authority  and my duty to the citizens of Utah require that I hold any nominee to a very high standard. Ms. Jewell is an impressive candidate.  Her experience as CEO of REI is solid. However, her experience in public land policy involves active participation in organizations that continually sue to restrict access to public land and prevent development of natural resources in Utah and across the West. Her public land policy experience raised serious questions that were not adequately addressed before today's business meeting.  For these reasons I oppose her appointment.   If she is confirmed, I will make every effort to work with Ms. Jewell on these critical issues which impact Utah and the nation.

Title: Ranking Member Lee Questions American Airlines/US Airways Merger Hearing Witnesses
Date: March 19, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, questioned witnesses in the hearing titled: “The American Airlines/US Airways Merger: Consolidation, Competition, and Consumers.”
"I believe this merger holds the promise of cost savings through combining complementary assets, reducing duplicative operating expenses, and integrating computer systems and airline fleets,” said Senator Lee.  “In a competitive market, consumers benefit from such efficiencies in the form of higher-quality services, like an expanded route network, at low prices."
"Absent evidence that a transaction will substantially reduce competition and thereby harm consumers, I believe government intervention is usually unwarranted."
"I look forward to working with the Department of Justice as it carefully examines this merger under our nation's antitrust laws."
Witnesses in today’s hearing included Douglas Parker, Chairman and CEO of US Airways Group; Thomas Horton, Chairman, President and CEO of American Airlines and AMR Corporation; Diana L. Moss, Director and Vice President of the American Antitrust Institute; and William McGee, Consultant at Consumers Union.

Title: Lee on ObamaCare: We Know What's In It
Date: March 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a speech on the Senate floor in support of the “Restore Growth First” amendment proposed by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), which would defund ObamaCare in the Continuing Resolution.
“Mr. President, almost everything the American people were told about Obamacare by the bill’s proponents has turned out to be false,” said Senator Lee. “We were promised it would save money. Now we know it will cost money. In just two short years, the projected ten-year cost of the federal government’s health care takeover has ballooned from $940 billion to $1.76 trillion. We were promised it would help a struggling economy. Now we know it will smother the economy.
“The reason Senator Cruz introduced and I support this amendment is that the case against Obamacare is rapidly moving from fears about tomorrow to pain felt today. In 2008, then-Senator Obama promised his policies would lower health care premiums for the average American family by $2,500.Four years later, and two years after President Obama signed Obamacare intolaw, the Kaiser Foundation reports family health insurance premiums have actually risen by $2,370.
“Mr. President, the beauty of the Cruz amendment is that we don’t have to pass it to discover what it would do. We know what it would do. It would delay Obamacare, and thereby save taxpayer money and American jobs.”

Floor Remarks on Cruz Defunding Obamacare Amendment
Senator Mike Lee
March 12, 2013
Mr. President,
I rise in support of the amendment introduced by my good friend, the gentleman from Texas, that would de-fund the implementation of the Affordable Care Act for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Mr. President, almost everything the American people were told about Obamacare by the bill’s proponents has turned out to be false.
We were promised it would save money. Now we know it will cost money.
In just two short years, the projected ten-year cost of the federal government’s health care takeover has ballooned from $940 billion to $1.76 trillion.
We were promised it would help a struggling economy. Now we know it will smothering the economy.
According to the Federal reserve, employers cite Obamacare as a principal reason for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire new employees.
According to the National Federation of Independent Business, Obamacare’s unconstitutional individual mandate will kill between 125,000 and 249,000 jobs over the next ten years.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, Obamacare will reduce total American employment by 800,000 jobs by 2021.
In fairness, Mr. President, these are only projections. Though I believe even they are optimistic.
They certainly contradict the fairy-tale arguments in favor of Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. But they are still best guesses.
The reason Senator Cruz introduced and I support this amendment is that the case against Obamacare is rapidly moving from fears about tomorrow to pain felt today.
In 2008, then-Senator Obama promised his policies would lower health care premiums for the average American family by $2,500. Four years later, and two years after President Obama signed Obamacare into law, the Kaiser Foundation reports family health insurance premiums have actually risen by $2,370.
This is one of the things we were told we needed to pass the bill in order to find: a $5,000 premium hike on working families. What else have we found?
We found that when the federal government requires businesses to provide health insurance for their full time employees, businesses will respond by cutting employee hours.
Other companies have chosen to go further, and have simply laid employees off all together or shipped jobs overseas.
Other companies have admitted that the costs Obamacare adds to their businesses will have to be passed on to their customers, in the form of higher prices.
Then there is the devastating impact Obamacare has had on our medical device industry, which is targeted for a special, punitive tax under the law. Companies from Boston Scientific, Stryker, Smith & Nephew and others are laying off workers and shipping jobs overseas.
It’s important to remember, Mr. President, that each of these layoffs is, in a sense, a double strike against our economy. On the one hand, when people lose their jobs and their health insurance, the economy suffers in and of itself.
But on the other hand, because Obamacare and the rest of the president’s failed agenda are weighing down our economy, there aren’t enough new jobs being creating for the recently unemployed to fill.
So the unemployed are not only staying unemployed for longer than normal, but they are also increasing demand for already over-burdened government assistance programs.
Thanks to Obamacare, fewer people are working and paying into the system to support the people Obamacare is preventing from finding work and health insurance in the first place.
Mr. President, the beauty of the Cruz amendment is that we don’t have to pass it to discover what it would do. We know what it would do. It would delay Obamacare, and thereby save taxpayer money and American jobs.
It would also restore a semblance of democratic accountability to the process. After all, the various Departments of the federal government have already issued 20,000 pages worth of regulations to formalize the Obamacare system. In other words, the thousand-page monstrosity Congress passed in 2010 was only a fraction of the final, deforesting product.
Does anyone – literally anyone in the entire country – know what those 20,000 pages of regulations say? For all we know, Mr. President, we could be violating Obamacare right now.
You might think I’m, exaggerating, Mr. President. But as we we were all shocked to learn recently, 98% of all individual health insurance policies in the United States right now are in violation of Obamacare’s standards.
When Obamacare goes into full effect, the  Americans who own those policies will have to either buy more expensive insurance, or pay the unconstitutional fine.
To recap, then, Obamacare is already costing us jobs. It is raising health care costs. It is adding to our deficit and debt. It is forcing families off of health insurance policies they have and like. It’s doubling as a Trojan Horse for 20,000 pages of new law no elected official wrote and not a single citizen in the United States has read.
And then of course, there is the slow-motion train wreck of the law’s implementation. A majority of states in the union have already refused to set up their own Obamacare exchanges. The bill has been passed, you see, Mr. President. And the American people now see what is in it. And they want no part of it.
And so the Department of Health and Human Services is now charged with setting up federal exchanges in those states. But they don’t know how. The clock is ticking. People are losing their health insurance. The exchanges are supposed to be ready to handle the massive influx of people dumped by Obamacare onto these exchanges… and the exchanges aren’t going to be there.
What will be there? According to report today by the Associated Press, uninsured Americans will find a 15-page, 21-step application that will need approval from three separate federal agencies. There are expected to be more than four million of these applications next year alone.
And as even an advocate of the program says in the AP story, the form “will take a considerable amount of time to fill out and will be difficult for many people to be able to complete.” And that part of the process [QUOTE] “does not get you to the selection of a plan.”
Mr. President, Obamacare is going to make doing your taxes feel like a round of golf.
For this reason, there are some who believe the only way to expose Obamacare and rescue the health care system is to let nature take its course. Let it go into effect as soon as possible. They say the sooner it collapses, the sooner we can repeal it and start over.
The gentleman from Texas and I, and everyone else supporting this amendment rejects that logic. We cannot in good conscience send millions of innocent Americans into a dangerously dysfunctional health care system run by incompetent bureaucrats.
We will not sacrifice millions of families to prove a political point. People’s lives and livelihoods are at stake. The American people are not pawns in Washington’s partisan game – we work for them, not the other way around.
As public servants, we have an obligation to protect the American people. Obamacare is going to hurt our country, our economy, our constituents, our neighbors. It is the single greatest threat to our economy and our health care system.
Eventually, Mr. President, Obamacare will be repealed. The American people will see the damage it does, and demand we scrap it and start over.
But for now, we must at least must defund it, at least for the life of this continuing resolution.
Senator Cruz and I have been assured this amendment will fail, and that Obamacare will move ahead as planned. If that is the will of the Senate, so be it.
But when Obamacare does start to break down… when waiting times start to grow… when costs start to explode… when taxes start to rise… when doctors and nurses start to quit… when hospitals start to close… when businesses start to shutter… when take home pay falls and jobs disappear… when patients and families truly find out what’s in this bill…
The American people will know who is responsible for the catastrophe of Obamacare… and who, like the gentleman from Texas, tried to help.

Title: Lee Office Updates White House Tour Request Policy
Date: March 7, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—In response to President Obama's announcement on March 5 that his
White House will be canceling "self-guided" public tours
as a result of sequester cuts, Senator Lee's office has updated their tour request policy.  Senator Lee's Utah constituents are still welcome to request a White House tour, but until the president reverses this unfortunate decision, there is no guarantee that constituents will be able to have these requests fulfilled.
Despite the sequester's cuts to his office budget, Senator Lee has prioritized his budget to continue offering staff-led tours of the U.S. Capitol.  He would also like to recognize the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, the National Archives, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for managing their budgets to continue offering tours to the public.
"The White House is a cherished monument that is part of our national identity and owned by the public," said Senator Lee. "I do not understand why the president would choose to punish school children, tour groups, and other visitors to the nation's capital instead of finding areas of excess and waste in the White House budget."
Utah constituents interested in scheduling Washington, D.C. tours may do so through Senator Lee's website:

Title: Lee Opposes D.C. Circuit Nominee Caitlin Halligan
Date: March 6, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered a Senate floor speech in opposition of DC Circuit nominee Caitlin Halligan, citing the lack of need for an additional judge in the Court, and concerns with Halligan's views in previous cases. The full text of the speech is available below and in the video above.
I rise today to speak in opposition to the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to be a Circuit Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is arguably the most important federal appellate court in our country’s judicial system, with primary responsibility to review administrative decisions made by many federal departments and agencies.  It has also served in several instances as a stepping-stone for judges who are later appointed to the Supreme Court.
As a result, the Senate has a longstanding practice of scrutinizing nominees to the D.C. Circuit.  And when evaluating particular nominees we have also carefully considered the need for additional judges on that court.
In July 2006, President Bush nominated an eminently qualified individual, Peter Keisler, to fill a seat on the D.C. Circuit.  Mr. Keisler is among the very finest attorneys in the country.  Because of his non-ideological approach to the law, Mr. Keisler enjoys broad, bipartisan support throughout the legal profession.
Despite these unassailable qualifications, Democratic senators blocked Mr. Keisler’s nomination.  He did not receive any floor consideration whatsoever—not even a cloture vote—and his nomination languished in the Judiciary Committee.
At the time, a number of Democratic senators sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee Chairman arguing that a nominee to the D.C. Circuit, “should under no circumstances be considered – much less confirmed – before we first address the very need for that judgeship.”  These senators specifically argued that the D.C. Circuit’s comparatively modest caseload in 2006 did not justify the confirmation of an additional judge to that court.
More than six years have passed and Ms. Halligan has been nominated, once again, to that very same seat on the D.C. Circuit.  But the court’s caseload remains just as minimal as it was then.
According to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, the D.C. Circuit’s caseload is so light that the number of appeals pending per judicial panel is 54 percent less than the average for federal courts of appeals.
With just 359 pending appeals per panel, the D.C. Circuit’s average workload is less than half that of other similar appellate courts.
The D.C. Circuit’s caseload has actually decreased since the time that Democrats blocked Mr. Keisler.  Since 2005:
The total number of appeals filed is down over 13 percent; and
The total number of appeals pending is down over 10 percent.
Some have sought to make much of the fact that since 2005, two of the court’s judges have taken senior status, leaving only seven active judges on the D.C. Circuit.
But the court’s caseload has declined so much in recent years that even filings per active judge are only slightly higher than they were in 2005.
Of course, this doesn’t account for the six senior judges on the D.C. Circuit who continue to hear appeals and author opinions.
Their contributions are such that the actual work for each active judge has declined and the caseload burden for D.C. Circuit judges is less than it was when Democrats blocked Mr. Keisler on the basis of declining caseload.
Indeed, the average filings per panel – perhaps the truest measure of actual workload per judge – is down almost 6 percent since that time.
In each of the last several years, the D.C. Circuit has cancelled regularly scheduled argument dates due to the lack of pending cases.  And those who work at the court suggest that in reality the workload isn’t any different today than it has been in the past.
According to the Democrats’ own standards – and particularly when there are judicial emergencies in other courts across the country – now is not the time to confirm another judge to the D.C. Circuit.  And it is certainly not the time for us to consider confirming a controversial nominee with a record of extreme views of the law and Constitution.
Make no mistake, Ms. Halligan is anything but a consensus nominee.  The Senate has already considered and rejected her nomination.  Nothing material has changed since that time.
Many of my colleagues have discussed a wide range of Ms. Halligan’s views, so I will limit myself today to just one example.  In 2003, while serving as Solicitor General of New York, Ms. Halligan approved and signed a legal brief arguing that handgun manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers should be held liable for criminal actions that individuals commit with the guns.  Three years later in 2006, Ms. Halligan filed another brief arguing that handgun manufacturers were guilty of creating a public nuisance.
Such arguments amount to an invitation for courts to engage in sweeping judicial activism; and the positions she took are both bewildering and flatly inconsistent with the original understanding of the Second Amendment rights that all Americans enjoy.
In conclusion, as measured by the Democrats’ own standards and their own prior actions, now is not the time to confirm another judge to the D.C. Circuit.  And it is certainly not the time to consider such a controversial nominee for that important court.  The Senate has already spoken and rejected Ms. Halligan’s nomination.  I urge my colleagues once again to oppose her confirmation.

Title: Lee Joins Cruz In Demanding Vote On Delaying Funding of Obamacare As Part of Continuing Resolution

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement:
"I will join Senator Cruz in objecting to Senate consideration of any Continuing Resolution without a vote on delaying funding of Obamacare.  Defunding Obamacare is essential to restoring economic growth.  At this time of fiscal turmoil, Congress shouldn’t borrow more money to pay for something we cannot afford.  Although I would prefer a full repeal of Obamacare, we should at minimum delay its implementation until our country is experiencing real, sustained economic growth."

Title: Lee Calls to Extend Comment Period for Gunnison Sage-grouse Endangered Species Listing
Date: March 5, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON - Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) recently joined six of his House and Senate colleagues to request a 60-day extension of the comment period of the proposed rules for the Gunnison sage-grouse in order to give local communities more time to participate in this complex ruling that could result in serious property use restrictions.
The letter sent to the Colorado Fish and Wildlife Service field director, Noreen Walsh, expressed concern about the impact this listing and proposed critical habitat will have on the local communities.  Along with Senator Lee, Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Mark Udall (D-CO), and Representatives Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), Jim Matheson (D-UT), and Scott Tipton (R-CO) signed the letter.
The proposed listing of the Gunnison Sage grouse was the result of a settlement agreement between an environmental group and the Fish and Wildlife Service.
“This practice, referred to as ‘sue and settle,’ is very problematic,” says Lee.  “In cases like this, an agreement is reached between Fish and Wildlife and environmental groups with very little opportunity for the communities most impacted by the decisions to have their voices heard.   By excluding local officials from these decisions, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service obstruct the ability of local officials to create conservation plans for threatened species even though local officials might have a better approach to protecting the species. ”
In order to counter the abusive “sue and settle” practice that is restricting property rights, stifling democratic processes, and draining the resources of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Senator Lee has co-sponsored the ESA Settlement Reform Act.  This legislation would protect the rights of local communities to weigh in, as well as improve transparency and reduce the cost of abusive regulations on hardworking taxpayers.  It would amend the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) to give states, counties and other affected parties a say in the settlement of certain ESA “citizen suits” and would prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to fund these lawsuits.

Title: Lee Joins 14 Senators In Call for Hagel Withdrawal
Date: February 21, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) joined
14 of his colleagues in calling on President Obama to withdraw Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be Secretary of Defense
.
“Over the last half-century, no Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and taken office with more than three Senators voting against him.  Further, in the history of this position, none has ever been confirmed with more than 11 opposing votes.  The occupant of this critical office should be someone whose candidacy is neither controversial nor divisive.”
“
Senator Hagel’s performance at his confirmation hearing
was deeply concerning, leading to serious doubts about his basic competence to meet the substantial demands of the office.  While Senator Hagel's erratic record and myriad conversions on key national security issues are troubling enough, his
statements regarding Iran were disconcerting
.“
Other Senators calling for the President to withdraw the nomination include Sens. Cornyn (R-TX), Inhofe (R-OK), Graham (R-SC), Wicker (R-MS), Vitter (R-LA), Cruz (R-TX), Toomey (R-PA), Rubio (R-FL), Coats (R-IN), R. Johnson (R - WI), Risch (R-ID), Barrasso (R-WY), Coburn (R-OK), Scott (R-SC).  The full text is available here and provided below.
February 21, 2013
President Barack H. Obama
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC  20500
Dear President Obama:
Last Thursday, the Senate voted to continue its consideration of your nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel to serve as our nation's next Secretary of Defense.  While we respect Senator Hagel's honorable military service, in the interest of national security, we respectfully request that you withdraw his nomination.
It would be unprecedented for a Secretary of Defense to take office without the broad base of bipartisan support and confidence needed to serve effectively in this critical position.  Over the last half-century, no Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and taken office with more than three Senators voting against him.  Further, in the history of this position, none has ever been confirmed with more than 11 opposing votes.  The occupant of this critical office should be someone whose candidacy is neither controversial nor divisive.
In contrast, in 2011, you nominated Leon Panetta, who was confirmed by the Senate with unanimous support.  His Pentagon tenure has been a huge success, due in part to the high degree of trust and confidence that Senators on both sides of the aisle have placed in him.  The next Secretary of Defense should have a similar level of broad-based bipartisan support and confidence in order to succeed at a time when the Department of Defense faces monumental challenges, including Iran’s relentless drive to obtain nuclear weapons, a heightened threat of nuclear attack from North Korea, potentially deep budget cuts, a strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific region, military operations in Afghanistan, the ongoing Global War on Terror, the continued slaughter of Syrian civilians at the hands of their own government, and other aftermath of the Arab Spring.
Likewise, Senator Hagel’s performance at his confirmation hearing was deeply concerning, leading to serious doubts about his basic competence to meet the substantial demands of the office.  While Senator Hagel's erratic record and myriad conversions on key national security issues are troubling enough, his statements regarding Iran were disconcerting.  More than once during the hearing, he proclaimed the legitimacy of the current regime in Tehran, which has violently repressed its own citizens, rigged recent elections, provided material support for terrorism, and denied the Holocaust.
Regarding U.S. policy on Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, Senator Hagel displayed a seeming ambivalence about whether containment or prevention is the best approach, which gives us great concern.  Any sound strategy on Iran must be underpinned by the highly credible threat of U.S. military force, and there is broad bipartisan agreement on that point.  If Senator Hagel becomes Secretary of Defense, the military option will have near zero credibility.  This sends a dangerous message to the regime in Tehran, as it seeks to obtain the means necessary to harm both the United States and Israel.
We have concluded that Senator Hagel is not the right candidate to hold the office of Secretary of Defense, and we respectfully request that you withdraw his nomination.  Thank you for your consideration.

Title: Lee Hosts Constitution Bowl Winners in Washington, DC
Date: February 15, 2013

WASHINGTON—Senator
Mike Lee hosted the winners of the 2012 Constitution Bowl in Washington, DC this week. The Cottonwood Heights teens won the opportunity to visit and tour our nation’s capitol when they proved their firm understanding of the U.S. Constitution in a competition with three other Utah teams in September.
“It was an honor to have the Cottonwood Heights team in Washington, DC this week,” said Senator Lee. “This group showed their knowledge and interest for our country’s founding document during the Constitution Bowl last fall, so it was exciting to have them here exploring and experiencing the rich history of our nation’s capital.”
Team members Kevin Liu, Monica Kowalski, Morgan Valentine, Haley Roberts, and Steven Deng enjoyed a night tour of the national monuments; toured the U.S.Capitol building and dome, Library of Congress, and White House; and watched Senator Lee deliver a speech on the Senate floor.
"Coming to DC has been an amazing opportunity, and to come and see everything that this great city has to offer is more than any of us deserved,” said Valentine, PR officer for the Cottonwood Heights Youth City Council. “We only wish we had more time to spend sight-seeing and getting to speak with Senator Lee. I know I speak for everyone when I say that this will definitely not be the only time we come to DC."
Senator Lee teamed up with the Utah League of Cities and Towns in September and launched the inaugural “Constitution Bowl,” testing the knowledge of teams from four local high schools on topics related to the U.S. Constitution as well as state and local government. The event was held in honor of the 225th Anniversary of the U.S. Constitution and to get students talking about the country’s founding document.
Students from Taylorsville, Cottonwood Heights, North Salt Lake, and West Point competed in the Jeopardy-style game in teams of four, with Senator Mike Lee, Speaker of the House Becky Lockhart, and Murray Mayor Dan Snarr delivering the clues.

Title: Lee Statement on US Airways, American Airlines Merger
Date: February 14, 2013

Content:
Today, Senator Lee, ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement on the proposed merger between US Airways and American Airlines:
“Mergers are an essential element of our rapidly changing economy, often creating significant efficiencies and helping ensure that resources are put to their most productive use,” said Senator Lee.  “In a competitive market, consumers benefit from these efficiencies in the form of high quality products and services at low prices.  Absent evidence that a transaction will substantially reduce competition and thereby harm consumers, I believe government intervention is usually unjustified.
“The proposed merger between US Airways and American Airlines has potential to benefit the air travel industry as well as consumers.  At the same time, a transaction of this size, which will result in the nation’s largest carrier, poses potential risks for the market.  In recent years, the airline industry has become increasingly consolidated and this merger would reduce the number of major carriers to four.
“Antitrust officials must ensure that an additional merger of this magnitude would not lead to higher passenger fares, result in diminished service to regional markets, or allow for coordinated conduct among rivals.  I look forward to joining Senator Klobuchar in a thorough review of this transaction and providing oversight of antitrust regulators as they do the same.”

Title: Lee Introduces Immigration Reform Bills
Date: February 13, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced two pieces of legislation that seek to reform America’s immigration system.  One bill would eliminate the per country percentage caps on all H1B visa holders. The second bill would extend the amount of time certain agricultural workers are allowed to stay and work.
“Our immigrations system isn’t just one big problem; it presents dozens of challenges,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Judiciary Committee which oversees immigration law. “The good news is that we have bipartisan support for how to fix many of the problems.  I don’t believe we should delay progress in these areas just because we have differences in a few others.  Both of these bills represent meaningful progress toward fixing our legal immigration system and meeting the demands of America’s economy.”
The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act eliminates the per country percentage caps on employment-based immigrants in the H1B visa program.  Current law caps the percentage of workers who can come from certain countries and does not reflect changes in the American economy over the last several decades.
"Educating, training, and employing the best and brightest, whether from the U.S. or abroad, is essential to the vibrancy of our economy and continued innovation," said Senator Lee.  "This bill will allow the business community to recruit employees based on their abilities rather than their country of origin."  Sen. Lee’s Utah colleague Rep. Jason Chaffetz has introduced companion legislation in the House (HR 633).
The Dairy and Sheep H2A (DASH) Act would allow dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders to apply for year-round positions through the H2A visa program.  Currently, temporary farm workers are only able to obtain seasonal visas. Under this legislation, visas for such workers would have an initial term of three years and could be renewed for additional periods of three years without requiring workers to return to their home countries. The DASH Act would in no way provide a legal path to citizenship and would require workers who do not obtain a proper renewal to return to their country of origin.
Previous versions of both bills have enjoyed strong bipartisan support. New York Senator Chuck Schumer was an original cosponsor of the DASH Act in the 112
th
Congress.  A version of The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act passed overwhelmingly in the House last year 389-15.

Title: Lee Opposes Hagel
Date: February 12, 2013

WASHINGTON – Today Senator Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voted against the confirmation of Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.  He released the following statement:
“While I am grateful for former Senator Chuck Hagel’s service as a soldier in Vietnam and as a U.S. Senator, I cannot support his nomination to be the next Secretary of Defense.
“Senator Hagel’s record on the issues most important to our national security is weak and his positions are dangerous. It is the long-standing foreign policy of the United States to not negotiate with terrorists.  Hezbollah is the best-funded, best-organized, and best-equipped Foreign Terrorist Organization in the world.  Yet Senator Hagel has called for direct talks between the United States and Hezbollah and Hamas.  In addition, Senator Hagel’s call for enormous cuts to the U.S. nuclear arsenal is dangerous and shortsighted.
“Senator Hagel’s changing positions on Israel are also troubling.  Israel is, without doubt, the most important ally the United States has in the Middle East.  We cannot afford to jeopardize our relationship with Israel or send a weak signal to their enemies.
“In addition, Senator Hagel has complied only with the bare minimum required by the committee regarding certain funding sources for his activities, although there are still many troubling questions. Instead of following precedents set by other top level cabinet nominees, Senator Hagel has chosen to set up roadblocks.
“We need strong leadership at the Pentagon.  Senator Hagel has not shown himself to be the right person for the job.”

Title: Stewart, Colleagues Urge Secretary Salazar to Release Federal Lands in Utah
Date: February 7, 2013

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Chris Stewart (UT-02), along with four other members of the Utah delegation, sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar, urging the Department to dispose of 5,423 acres of federal land in Utah that has been identified as suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). It has been reported that BLM is actively identifying and purchasing private property with the goal of preventing commercial activities within Garfield County. Currently, Garfield County has just three percent of its land in private ownership, limiting economic growth. Returning this land to Garfield County would allow for increased commercial activities and help grow the economy in Utah.
“Let us be clear, we are not suggesting that this paltry amount of disposals makes up for BLM’s obvious abuse, because we believe this number is far too small and more lands should be made available, but we urge the Department to use whatever means necessary to process these disposals in an expedited manner, using categorical exclusions and other fast-tracking authorities to dispose of this diminutive percentage of federal property,” members of the delegation wrote.
The Members of Congress that signed this letter along with Congressman Stewart include, Rep. Rob Bishop (UT-01), Rep. Jason Chaffetz (UT-03), Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).
The text of the letter sent is below:
February 7, 2013
The Honorable Ken Salazar
Secretary
Department of the Interior
1849 C St NW
Washington, D.C. 20240
Secretary Salazar:
We are deeply troubled by recent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) decisions to suppress economic activity within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (Monument).  It has been reported that BLM is actively identifying and purchasing private property with the express goal of preventing commercial activities within Garfield County[1].
In light of this disheartening situation, we request your help in expediting the disposal of federal lands within Garfield County.  Approximately 5,423 acres of federal land have been identified by BLM as suitable for disposal, or 0.002% of Garfield County’s landmass.  Let us be clear, we are not suggesting that this paltry amount of disposals makes up for BLM’s obvious abuse, because we believe this number is far too small and more lands should be made available, but we urge the Department to use whatever means necessary to process these disposals in an expedited manner, using categorical exclusions and other fast-tracking authorities to dispose of this diminutive percentage of federal property.
With just 3% of land within Garfield County in private ownership, it is imperative that these disposals happen in a timely manner.  Concurrently, we have major concerns with BLM’s land acquisition decision and expect a thorough explanation.
Commercial activities and economic development opportunities in Garfield County are already limited.  When President Clinton unilaterally designated the Monument in 1996, a suite of economic development options were taken away from county leaders and residents.  Resource development, ranching, and motorized recreation are some of the activities that instantly became discouraged or stopped altogether.
National environmental groups and out-of-state politicians lauded President Clinton’s proclamation then and continue to offer support for the Monument now.  More recently, you touted the economic benefits that outdoor recreation has on local economies:
“Protected public spaces can serve as magnets for visitors. Though the [National Landscape Conservation System] accounts for only 10 percent of the lands BLM manages, its lands are now welcoming more than 9 million visitors a year.  Those 9 million visitors spend money at local motels, grocery stores, and gas stations. They rent bikes and use guide services (emphasis added)[2].”
When the BLM spends nearly half a million taxpayer dollars to suppress commercial activity, they are suppressing the very activities you touted in your speech.  How can “protected public spaces” grow economies or benefit local communities if commercial activity is discouraged or suppressed?  If commercial activity is prohibited within the Monument, where are visitors supposed to sleep at night, eat during the day, fill up their tanks, or rent recreation equipment?
We urge the Department to do the right thing and quickly dispose of the federal acreage identified by BLM as suitable for disposal.  Without this action the families of these affected communities continue to suffer economic harm at the hands of the federal government.
Sincerely,
Rep. Chris Stewart
Rep. Rob Bishop
Rep. Jason Chaffetz
Sen. Orrin Hatch
Sen. Mike Lee

“The Interior Department’s record of working with state and local authorities on land management issues under President Obama is subpar at best,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which will be holding hearings for the new Interior Secretary nominee. “Utah's energy, ranching, recreation, and tourism industries are continually threatened by the department's land use management policies.  The department’s approach has hurt our economy, killed jobs, and prevented states like Utah from generating critical revenue.  I look forward to hearing the testimony of Mrs. Jewell, and I am hopeful the next Secretary of Interior will see their role in a balanced way to serve the interests of the country, the states, and local communities.”

Title: Lee Statement on Group of Eight Proposal
Date: January 28, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee made the following statement with regard to the Statement of Principles on immigration reform released by the Group of Eight:
“Despite the often divisive rhetoric surrounding immigration reform, initial discussions have revealed much common ground between Republicans and Democrats.  We all support enhanced border security, stronger visa enforcement, effective employment verification measures, and humane treatment of those lacking legal status.  I believe the overwhelming majority of Congress could work together to enact significant and lasting reforms, particularly to strengthen border security and fix our legal immigration system.
“I remain greatly supportive of what the group aims to accomplish and will continue to work with my colleagues to solve many of the challenges this important issue presents. Although I am encouraged by the process and continue to support efforts to make real progress on immigration reform, I am not able to sign the Statement of Principles released today.
“These guidelines contemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to illegal immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country. Reforms to our complex and dysfunctional immigration system should not in any way favor those who came here illegally over the millions of applicants who seek to come here lawfully.
“Additionally, the framework carves out a special exception for agricultural workers that has little justification.  Maintaining the safety of America’s food supply is an important goal, but it is unclear why immigrants in this sector should achieve special status over skilled workers in industries equally important to the American economy.
“Overall, I am encouraged by the opportunities presented by the Group of Eight. I will be formulating an approach that deals with points of agreement on several issues, with special attention to addressing border security and fixing our legal immigration system before we create special categories for those here illegally.  I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on these proposals.”

Title: Lee Amendment to Cut Tiny Fraction of New Spending Fails
Date: January 28, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment that would reduce total federal spending over the next nine years by one-half of one percent to offset new spending in the Sandy disaster relief bill (HR 152).  The vote failed 35 - 62.
“My amendment would have cut a tiny fraction of total federal spending to pay for emergency relief for disaster victims,” said Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee.  “It is the equivalent of cutting 50 cents for every $100 Congress appropriates. Unfortunately, the Senate has again revealed it is not serious about showing even the smallest bit of fiscal discipline.
“In the coming weeks, Congress will be expected to find more than $1 trillion in cuts over the next ten years to address the sequester.  The Budget Control Act requires Congress to reduce spending by $109 billion in the first year of the sequester alone, seventeen times more than what my bill would cut this year.   We have tough days ahead if today we cannot find one-half of one percent to eliminate out of the federal budget.
“Paying for what you spend should be non-controversial.  It should be a principle Congress follows every time we spend the taxpayer dollars of hard working Americans.  Today’s vote underscores the need for structural spending reforms, like a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. No Congress will restrain itself, therefore we need structural restraints in place to prevent future Congresses from driving the country further into debt.”

Title: Lee Praises D.C. Circuit Ruling on President Obama’s Unconstitutional “Recess” Appointments
Date: January 25, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding the opinion issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit holding that President Obama’s January 2012 appointments to the National Labor Relations Board are unconstitutional and invalid.
“I am pleased that after careful review a federal court of appeals concluded that President Obama’s so-called ‘recess’ appointments were indeed unconstitutional,” said Lee.  “When President Obama bypassed the Senate and unilaterally made key appointments at a time the Senate considered itself in session, he ignored the plain text of the Constitution and endangered the checks and balances essential to our nation’s system of government accountability.  As the D.C. Circuit rightly concluded, ‘Allowing the President to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution’s separation of powers.’
“Over the course of the last year, I have spoken out against these unprecedented and unconstitutional actions in numerous settings, including in meetings of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and in countless interviews in the press.  In protest of these unconstitutional appointments, I voted against President Obama’s judicial and executive appointments.  Today’s decision represents vindication of the principled stand I have taken against this President’s disregard of our nation’s Constitution.
“The court’s ruling today is a sober reminder of how far detached this administration has become from our constitutional heritage and the rule of law.  By failing to follow the Constitution’s specified procedure for appointing executive officials, the President has created chaos and confusion for the business community, which has been left uncertain as to the validity of the many rules and regulations promulgated by officers that were not appointed according to the Constitution’s requirements.”

Title: Lee: President’s Speech “A Disappointing Reprise of His Divisive Campaign Rhetoric”
Date: January 22, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement on the president’s second inaugural address:
"The beginning of a second term has historically been an opportunity for the president to signal a willingness to move past political divisions and unite all Americans for the common good,” said Senator Lee.  “As Ronald Reagan said in his second inaugural address, 'For all our problems, for all our differences, we are together as of old'.
"Unfortunately for the country, on a day when the president should speak with a unifying voice for all Americans, his inaugural speech was, instead, a disappointing reprise of his divisive campaign rhetoric. Rather than define us as a nation, he chose to divide us as a people. This is not the approach of a leader attempting to find solutions to problems but rather the tactics of a partisan trying to pick political fights. His vision for the next four years is clear: defend a broken system, ignore the fiscal crisis, and drive future generations further into debt."

Title: Lee Introduces Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: January 22, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that requires Washington to live within it means and puts strict limits on the ability of Congress to run deficits and add to the national debt.
“Washington’s insatiable need to borrow and spend has put off difficult decisions and threatened the prosperity of future generations. It is unconscionable and immoral,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee. “We have an obligation to correct course and put the country on a responsible path to fiscal sustainability.  Families, businesses, and state and local governments are all expected to live within their means.  The federal government should do the same.
“All past efforts of Congress to limit spending have utterly failed. None of the existing restraints – the Budget Act, spending caps, the debt limit, the sequester – have gotten spending under control, and we have $16.4 trillion of debt to prove it.  Only a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution will permanently bind Congress and force both parties to live within the nation’s means.  Anything less will simply maintain our dysfunctional and unsustainable status quo.”
The proposed amendment, S. J. Res 1, requires Congress to spend no more than it takes in during any fiscal year and limits spending to 18% of the gross national product, the 40 year historical average of total federal receipts.  Congress can only run a deficit, raise taxes or increase the debt limit if agreed to by a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate.  The amendment gives standing to any member of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the balanced budget requirement as long as they have been authorized to do so by a petition signed by one-third of either the House or the Senate.  The amendment would become effective one year after ratification by three-fourths of the states.
Senator Lee has been a tireless advocate of a balanced budget amendment and has authored two previous versions.  A vote on S. J. Res 10 in the 112
th
Congress received the support of 47 senators.
Bipartisan support for a balanced budget amendment has grown in recent years.  A sense of the Senate resolution in support of amending the constitution to require a balanced budget received 58 votes in 2011, and nearly two dozen Democrats voted in favor of an alternative version of Senator Lee’s balanced budget amendment.  At least 23 Democrats have indicated their support for the provision in the past.

Title: Lee Statement on the President’s Gun Control Proposals
Date: January 16, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee made the following statement in response to the president’s announcement regarding new executive actions on gun control:
“It is unfortunate that the president is using the tragedy in Newtown to advance a set of proposals that would do little, if anything, to prevent these kinds of shocking events,” said Senator Lee. “Instead, his laundry list consists of demands that Congress limit the rights of law abiding citizens, executive orders that essentially affirm the status quo, and initiatives to increase federal interference into state and local law enforcement and educational institutions.”
“Without specific legislative language, it is impossible to evaluate the potential consequences of the president’s proposals. But I am deeply concerned that the president’s approach is inconsistent with fundamental Second Amendment rights and encroaches on the authorities of state and local governments.  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I look forward to this debate and am committed to ensuring that the rights of citizens are not infringed and public safety is not diminished.”

Title: Senator Lee Reacts to Obama's Debt Limit Press Conference
Date: January 14, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement in reaction to President Obama's press conference today on the the upcoming debt ceiling debate:
"I agree with the president that we should not be a 'deadbeat nation' and that we should 'stabilize our debt and our deficit in a sustainable way,'" said Senator Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee. "The most balanced and least partisan way to do that is to enact a permanent, structural spending restraint, such as a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, that requires Congress to live within its means.  It would enable us to protect those who are most vulnerable, such as individuals on Medicare and Social Security, and ensure the viability of those programs for future beneficiaries.  It would also forever remove the possibility of using certain groups, such as veterans and seniors, as political pawns in Washington's budget battles, as well as end the practice of political brinksmanship in self-inflicted crises.  The president says he wants to stabilize our debt, reduce our deficit, ensure we make important investments to improve our economy, and end political gamesmanship. I share his interest in these goals and hope he will join me in pursuing the right spending reforms so that we may achieve them."

Title: Lee Statement on Nomination of Jack Lew for Treasury Secretary
Date: January 10, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding the nomination of Jack Lew to lead the Department of Treasury:
“As the country struggles with a painfully slow economic recovery, Washington needs leaders who are willing to support reforms that will put us on a sustainable fiscal path,” said Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee. “Unfortunately, the nomination of Jack Lew as Secretary of Treasury signals that the president will continue to pursue the same failed policies of the previous four years: higher taxes, more spending, and more debt.  It virtually guarantees the president will not compromise on entitlement reform, and assures that the White House will fight to maintain the status quo of our deeply dysfunctional system.  At a moment when the president could have shown a willingness to work with Republicans to fix the challenges that face the country, he has instead moved in a disappointing direction.”

“The United States continues to face significant national security challenges and it is critical to have strong leadership at the Pentagon that can respond to our evolving and emerging threats.  The nomination of Senator Hagel presents an opportunity to discuss not only his qualifications for the position and his approach to defending the United States and her allies, but also the specific ways in which he would seek to strengthen, modernize, and reform our national defense. I look forward to hearing Senator Hagel’s answers to questions involving these important issues.”

Title: Lee Reacts to the FTC's Ruling on Google Antitrust Probe
Date: January 3, 2013

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), the top Republican on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, issued the following statement today on the Federal Trade Commission's announcement on its antitrust probe of Google.
“As a consequence of the FTC’s investigation, Google has agreed both to settle allegations it misused patents to impede competition in high-tech markets and to change some problematic practices relating to its Internet search and advertising businesses.
“Google’s commitment to allow advertisers to export ad campaign data to other platforms will enhance meaningful competition in the market for Internet advertising.  And Google’s promise not to misappropriate content from other websites will help ensure the company does not abuse its dominant position to inhibit competition among vertical search sites.  Along with the FTC, our Subcommittee will seek to make certain that Google abides by these commonsense commitments.
“Although these voluntary actions represent an important step in the right direction, today’s agreement does not address all the concerns about anticompetitive conduct raised at our Subcommittee hearing.  We will continue to work with antitrust authorities to help ensure robust competition in the Internet search arena so that consumer welfare is maximized.
“I am pleased that the FTC took action to help curtail the abuse of standard-essential patents.  A reliable standards-setting process, through which participants promise to license contributed technology on reasonable terms, is essential to interoperability and consumer choice.  I look forward to reviewing the precise contours of the consent order prohibiting Google and its subsidiaries from seeking an injunction or exclusion order against willing licensees, and I remain committed to helping ensure that standard-essential patents are not abused in an anticompetitive manner."

Title: Lee Statement on Delta acquisition of significant stake in Virgin Atlantic
Date: December 11, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, issued the following statement regarding Delta Air Lines Inc.’s announcement that it will acquire a 49 percent share of Virgin Atlantic Airways for $360 million.
“Delta’s acquisition of almost half of Virgin Atlantic’s shares has the potential to benefit the company and consumers, including many Utah residents who take advantage of Delta’s Salt Lake City hub.  The planned joint venture between the companies would expand Delta’s access to Heathrow Airport in London, increase its resources to compete with other airlines, and augment its flexibility to serve customers.  At the same time, consolidation can sometimes pose a threat to competition as fewer providers dominate a larger share of a market.  As with all transactions of this significance, I will take a close look to ensure that it complies with antitrust laws and will be in the best interest of consumers.”

Title: Lee Applauds Vote to Protect Parental Rights, American Sovereignty
Date: December 4, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee applauded the Senate for voting to protect American sovereignty, uphold the rights of parents, and block the recognition of so-called international “entitlement rights.”  Thirty-seven senators joined Lee in opposing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in an effort to ensure certain provisions would not become the “supreme law of the land.”
“America is the gold standard when it comes to protecting the rights of the disabled. Today’s vote doesn’t change that,” said Lee after the vote. “Instead, the Senate rightfully rejected a treaty that could threaten the rights of parents to determine the best education, treatment, and care for their disabled children.  It also halted our possible descent down the rabbit hole of international ‘entitlement rights’ – which could have serious consequences for domestic law.  I applaud the Senate for preserving our sovereignty.”
The UNCRPD received 61 votes of support and ratification requires two-thirds of the Senate to vote in favor.

Title: Lee-Akaka Bipartisan Hatch Act Reform Passes Senate
Date: December 3, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Lee’s bipartisan reform that protects the rights of states to determine for themselves how to handle partisan political activity by state and local employees recently passed in the Senate.  The bill, S. 2170 The Hatch Act Modernization Act, still prohibits inappropriate political action, but fixes the law so that state and local employees who work for agencies which receive partial federal funding are not barred from running in a partisan election.
“The law was meant to prevent federal employees from engaging in partisan politics,” said Senator Lee.  “Unfortunately, it has been used to prevent state and local employees whose organizations may receive some federal funding from running for elected office.  States should be allowed to make their own laws with regard to the political activity of state and local employees and not have the policy dictated to them by Washington. I am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan solution on this issue and encourage my colleagues in the House to do the same."
Two Democratic senators, Daniel Akaka (HI) and Carl Levin (MI), and one Independent, Joe Lieberman (CT), have cosponsored the bill along with Senator Lee. The bill was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and will be sent to the House of Representatives.

Title: Lee Calls to Extend Comment Period for Proposal to List Coral Pink Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle as Threatened
Date: November 30, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – On November 2, 2012, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) joined Representatives Rob Bishop (R-UT) and Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) in asking Director Daniel Ashe of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to provide a 90 day extension to the comment period for the Proposed Rule on Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Threatened Status for Coral Pink Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle and Designation of Critical Habitat.
In a letter written to Ashe, these three members of the Utah delegation identify the complexity of the proposed designation of critical habitat, the requirement that comments be highly technical in nature, and the need for the Service to make cited sources available to the public as reasons for the proposed extension.
On November 23, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made the cited sources available to the public leaving only 10 days for the public to make informed comments on this proposal before the comment period closes on December 3.
“An initial review of the proposal to list the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle as a threatened species and the designation of critical habitat indicates that this listing could essentially shut down one of Utah’s popular state parks,” Lee said.  “Because this listing could shut down the Coral Pink Sand Dunes for recreational use, a thorough analysis of whether this species truly warrants the powerful protections of the Endangered Species Act is necessary.  I am hopeful that the Fish and Wildlife Service will provide a 90 day extension to the comment period to give the public the time it needs to evaluate this proposal.”

Title: Lee Votes In Favor of Amending the ECPA
Date: November 29, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today at the Senate Judiciary Committee markup, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) voted in favor of amending the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to require that the government obtain a warrant to access the contents of a person's email.  The measure, which was favorably reported out of the committee, would eliminate the “180-day rule” that currently allows government agencies to access emails older than 180 days with only an administrative subpoena or other similar request.
“I believe that email is precisely the type of private communication the Fourth Amendment was meant to protect from unjustified government intrusion,” said Senator Lee.  “Eliminating the ‘180-day rule’ is crucial to establish the privacy protections that Americans rightly expect when it comes to their electronic communications.  I am pleased that my colleagues agreed that the government should be required to obtain a warrant  to access the content of our emails.”
The privacy measure was included as part of the Video Protection Privacy Act (VPPA), which increases consumer choice over how video records are shared by services like Netflix, allowing users to opt-in to a service that could publish on social media sites the titles of videos users watch.

Title: Feinstein, Lee Introduce Amendment to Protect Civil Liberties
Date: November 29, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would protect American citizens from being indefinitely detained.  The amendment, which is cosponsored by several other Republican and Democratic senators, uses essentially the same language as the Due Process Guarantee Act, which Feinstein and Lee introduced last year.  The language of the amendment assures that no authorization to use military force, war declaration, or any similar authority would allow an American apprehended in the United States to be held without charge or trial.
During a discussion of their amendment on the Senate floor today, Sen. Lee said, “Senator Feinstein and I have worked closely together over the course of the past year to craft what we believe represents a very prudent course in protecting both our nation and our liberties at the same time. Security is important, and precisely because it's important, it must not be acquired at the expense of our individual liberty. It may well be said that government's most important basic responsibility is to protect the liberties of its citizens. Our nation has fought wars on American soil and around the world in defense of individual liberty.  And we must not sacrifice this most fundamental right in pursuit of greater security, especially when we can achieve security without compromising liberty. The Feinstein-Lee amendment does precisely that.
“We must stand behind our 225-year-old founding document as it's been amended to ensure our liberty isn't taken away from us, to give us a path to providing for our security without jeopardizing the freedom that our American citizens cherish so much and have fought so hard and so long to protect. Granting the United States government the power to deprive its own citizens of life, liberty, or property without full due process of law goes against the very nature of our nation's great constitutional values. This amendment, the Feinstein-Lee amendment, protects those values.”
On the floor, Sen. Feinstein explained, “I want to be very clear about what this amendment is and what it's not about. It's not about whether citizens such as [Yaser Esam] Hamdi and [Jose] Padilla or others who would do us harm should be captured, interrogated, incarcerated and severely punished. They should be. But what about an innocent American? What about someone in the wrong place at the wrong time, with the wrong skin color?
“The beauty of our Constitution is that it gives everyone in the United States basic due process rights to a trial by a jury of their peers. That is what makes this nation great. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the plurality in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, ‘[A]s critical as the government's interest may be in detaining those who actually pose an immediate threat to the national security of the United States during ongoing international conflict, history and common sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression and abuse of others who do not present that sort of threat.’
“The federal government experimented with indefinite detention of United States citizens during World War II, a mistake we now recognize as a betrayal of our core values. Let's not repeat it.”
The amendment is also sponsored by Senators Paul (R-KY), Coons (D-DE), Collins (R-ME), Lautenberg (D-NNJ), Gillibrand (D-NY), Kirk (R-IL), Tester (D-MT), Johnson (D-SD), Sanders (I-VT), Whitehouse (D-RI), Baucus (D-MT), and Heller (R-NV).
Transcript of the speech:
Mr. president, I rise today to speak in favor of the Feinstein-Lee amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. At the outset I’d like to note that this amendment is the product of bipartisan discussion and collaboration on an issue that's important to all Americans. I’m pleased to have been a part of that process.
Senator Feinstein and I have worked closely together over the course of the past year to craft what we believe represents a very prudent course in protecting both our nation and our liberties at the same time. Security is important and precisely because it's important, it must not be acquired at the expense of our individual liberty. It may well be said that government's most important basic responsibility is to protect the liberties of its citizens. Our nation has fought wars on American soil and around the world in defense of individual liberty. And we must not sacrifice this most fundamental right in pursuit of greater security, especially when we can achieve security without compromising liberty.
The Feinstein-Lee Amendment does precisely that. It protects liberty by ensuring that no American will be deprived of due process. The Fifth Amendment states that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Sixth Amendment likewise guarantees that individuals accused of a crime will have access to an attorney and access to a trial by a jury consisting of that person's peers. Our amendment protects those rights and provides an authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States.
Now, it's important to note that the Supreme Court has never specifically held that an authorization for the use of military force somehow authorizes the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person apprehended within the United States. And I don't think that we should break new ground here. I don't think we should start opening that precedent and suggest that is somehow acceptable. The constitution does in fact require nothing less than traditional due process for all Americans apprehended within the United States. As Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia has written, the gist of the due process clause was to force the government to follow common law procedures, traditionally deemed necessary before depriving a person of life, liberty or property. When a citizen was deprived of liberty because of alleged criminal conduct, those procedures typically required committal by a magistrate followed by indictment and trial. I understand and respect, of course, the fact that we live in perilous times. As Americans, we unfortunately have enemies, not only around the world but even within our own borders. This is unfortunate. This creates challenging times for us. and I hope and pray every day that we will be successful in fending off those who would harm us, those who hate our way of life and everything about us and will do everything in their power to destroy us and our liberty. But that does not, it cannot, it will not mean that we as Americans surrender our basic instinct to be free.
We must stand behind our 225-year-old founding document as it's been amended to ensure our liberty isn't taken away from us to give us a path to providing for our security without jeopardizing the freedom that our American citizens cherish so much and have fought so hard and so long to protect. Granting the United States government the power to deprive its own citizens of life, liberty, or property without full due process of law goes against the very nature of our nation's great constitutional values. This amendment, the Feinstein-Lee amendment, protects those values. I urge my colleagues to support it. Thank you, Mr. president.

Title: Feinstein, Lee Amendment Passes
Date: November 29, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment sponsored by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that protects Americans from indefinite detention. By a vote of 67 to 29, the amendment was added to the National Defense Authorization Act and ensures that American citizens and permanent legal residents apprehended on American soil will be charged and have access to a trial. It was the result of more than a year of collaboration by the California Democrat and Utah Republican in an effort to protect Americans' due process rights.
“I am pleased to see a large bipartisan majority of the Senate support basic protections for all Americans,” said Lee after the vote.  “Once again we prove that increasing security does not have to result in diminished liberty.  Today we have reaffirmed our constitutional values and shown we are committed to being both free and safe.”

Title: Lee Calls to End Process of ‘Filling the Tree’
Date: November 15, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee called on the Senate Majority Leader to end the abuse of procedural tactics used to prevent debate on legislation.  In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Lee said that by “filling the tree” the Majority Leader blocked other senators from offering “any amendments other than those few that the majority leader decided could be offered.”
The Senate is currently considering legislation that would have a wide range of effects on public land use, as well as wildlife conservation and management. Lee said he voted to proceed to the bill believing he would have an opportunity to offer up amendments.
“The bill is important to me in many respects. One of the things that has gotten my attention is that it addresses a number of issues related to federal public lands. It addresses a number of other issues related to wildlife conservation, wildlife management and other issues that are important to hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts across the country. One of the reasons why this bill is especially important to me is that I represent the great state of Utah, a state that has a lot of federal land,” Lee remarked in the speech.
He inquired as to why the Majority Leader felt it necessary to block the amendment process when the Senate has shown the ability to debate and amend broad and complicated pieces of legislation in the past, such as the National Defense Authorization Act and the Farm Bill.
“I appreciated the Majority Leader's willingness in that circumstance to allow us to have a pretty open, robust debate and discussion and an open amendment process. We still passed the bill even though we had to conduct a lot of debate, a lot of discussion, and a lot of votes,” he said.
Lee concluded: “I ask him, I implore him as my friend to reconsider this practice of ‘filling the tree’ and thereby forestalling the introduction of amendments. We need an open amendment process. Our status as the world's greatest deliberative legislative body requires nothing less.”
Read the full text of the speech below:
Mr. president, I stand today to explain my “no” vote on cloture this morning in connection with the Sportsman's Bill, s. 3525. This is a large bill made up of a number of legislative proposals that have been put together in many settings. This is a good way to legislate. In many respects, it is, and we utilize this procedure on a constant basis in order to make the laws of our country. Like many other pieces of legislation that have come before us that have been formed in this fashion, this is a bill to which I can say I support it in part and I don't support in part. There are parts of it that a like a lot and there are other parts that I like a lot less. That's exactly why we have an amendment process. True debate in this country, especially in this body presupposes and depends for its existence on the availability of an open amendment process. You see, when you go into a store you can decide which items you want to buy. You can decide to buy bread and milk and eggs or any combination of the three or other products you might want. However, it would be disturbing if you got to the grocery store counter and were told that you may not buy bread and milk and eggs unless you also buy a bucket of nails, a half ton of iron ore, a book about cowboy poetry and a Barry Manilow album. Sometimes that's what we're told when we vote in the senate. In order to get some things you want, you have to buy a whole bunch of other things that you might not want. That is the reality of the legislative process. It's the reality of compromise and it's one that we experience everyday. But again, this is why it's important for us to have an amendment process, so that we can at least debate and discuss the relevant merits of each piece of legislation and more importantly, so that we might figure out how to take a good piece of legislation and make it better.
In this circumstance, the majority leader has used a procedure known as filling the tree. He filled the tree, which means, in effect, that we can't offer amendments other than those few that the majority leader decided could be offered. It shuts down debate. There can be no significant debate beyond that which will lead to a vote once the tree has been filled. This is a problem. Republicans in this body, myself included, voted recently to proceed to this bill believing in good faith that there would be an opportunity to amend it.
The bill is important to me in many respects. One of the things that has gotten my attention is that the bill addresses a number of issues related to federal public lands. It addresses a number of other issues related to wildlife conservation, wildlife management and other items that are important to hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts across the country and in my state in particular. One of the reasons why this bill is especially important to me is that i represent the great state of Utah, a state that has a lot of federal land. in fact, two-thirds of the land in my state is owned by the federal government. For that and other reasons, I'd like the opportunity to address this piece of legislation by offering up amendments, amendments that would make a good bill better. But this process, a process whereby the majority leader rules this body by dictate is not good for the senate. We come to expect that the United States Senate will be a great deliberative body. In fact, the United States senate has long prided itself on being the world's greatest deliberative legislative body. There are a number of realities about the senate that make this possible, far more possible than it might be in the House of Representatives. Here in the senate, we have only a hundred members. Just down the hall in the House of Representatives, they have 435 members. In that body, it's not always possible to have an open amendment process. In this body, it is assumed. This is the usual order. This is the way we're supposed to operate, is to have an opportunity for members to offer and debate and discuss amendments in advance of voting for the procedure at the end of the day. Yet we have not had such an opportunity in this case because the leader filled the tree. This is significant and I want to emphasize this point. It is true, of course, that majority leaders from both political parties have utilized this procedure from time to time for one reason or another, perhaps out of professed need to expedite the legislative process in certain instances. But this majority leader has utilized this procedure a lot more than others. In fact, he's utilized it, by my count, a total of 67 times, more than any other majority leader in history. Why, I ask, has he done this? Why has he done this in this circumstance? Why has he done it in so many other circumstances in this congress and throughout his service as majority leader? Is it because the senate has demonstrated an inability to debate and discuss bills and amendments to bills in a reasonable, responsible manner? I don't think so.
Let’s point to a couple of examples of when the open-amendment process has benefitted us. One example is the National Defense Authorization Act, which this body passed toward the end of last year. It passed out of this body overwhelmingly, notwithstanding the fact that there were a number of amendments introduced. I believe there were dozens of amendments that were introduced, debated, discussed and ultimately voted upon. Another example involves the farm bill that was passed by this body earlier this year. If I’m not mistaken, we had over 70 amendments to that bill. I appreciated the majority leader's willingness in that circumstance to allow us to have a pretty open, robust debate and discussion and an open amendment process. We still passed the bill even though we had to conduct a lot of debate, have a lot of discussion and hold a lot of votes. But this, you see, is what makes this the greatest deliberative body in the world. This is what separates us from other legislative bodies around the country and throughout this planet. So it's not the case that the senate simply isn't responsible enough to be able to handle something like an open amendment process because it has demonstrated its ability to do so time and time and time again.
Now let's talk about some of the things I like in this bill. I support the fact that this bill would reduce access to public lands and would remove some burdensome regulations on some activities occurring on those lands. On the other hand, I am not as enthusiastic about the fact that this bill devotes $6.5 million on neo tropical migratory birds on a program that would require 75% of those funds to be spent outside the United States. Now, I know in the big picture of things this is a very, very small figure in terms of our total national budget. Nevertheless, this is a lot of money to hardworking Americans who are paying their taxes in order to fund programs like this. We ought at least to have an opportunity to debate and discuss amendments so that Americans can feel like their money is being spent in the United States for causes that are important to Americans and not on birds outside the United States. Other senators have other differences with the bill and other concerns. I agree with some of those concerns. I disagree with others. Each of them should have an opportunity to have those concerns aired, to have them debated and discussed in connection with amendments of their own choosing, that they might choose to introduce. We should be debating all of them. Instead, in effect, we're debating none of them. That kind of process is especially important in this circumstance because, this bill, as I understand it, has never gone through committee. Normally in committee we have an opportunity to put a bill through the markup process, to make amendments in committee. This didn't go there, which is all the more reason why we should have an open amendment process.
I have introduced several amendments. I’ll refer to just a few of them. One of them would involve a proposal to not spend money that we don't have in order to support the conservation of multinational species, saving $150 million over five years. In other words, it's one thing to spend money on habitat preservation and species rehabilitation for species that actually exist in the United States but it's another thing to spend a lot of money on species outside the United States, on creatures that have never entered our borders and never will. That’s something that I think Americans are concerned about and it's something that I think we ought to have a chance to debate and discuss as long as we are debating and discussing and voting on this legislation.
I have another piece of legislation that would require state legislative approval for any new federal land designations. As I said a few minutes ago, with the federal government owning two-thirds of the land in my state, I’m especially concerned about the possibility of, for example, the president deciding to just designate a new national monument within my state. This happened a few years ago when president Clinton designated the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. It's beautiful land and territory, but all of this was accomplished by the stroke of a pen of one chief executive without any opportunity for input from Utah, from its 3 million residents, from its elected officials. I think that any time the federal government takes this kind of action, the type that will have a profound impact on the state, on its sovereign rights, on its ability to raise revenue, on its ability to encourage and promote economic activity within its boundaries, there ought to be input and approval from the state legislature. I have an amendment that would address this concern.
I have another amendment that would offer certain federal lands for disposal by competitive sale process. We have an enormous amount of land in this country. Some of it is being put to good use and some is being set aside because of its wilderness characteristics. Other land still is just sitting there not doing anything. I think some of that land could be sold and some of that money could be used to fund our programs, programs that are cash strapped along with everything else in this country right now. These and other amendments need to receive consideration. I’m not saying that every one of them has to pass in order for this legislation to proceed, but every one of them ought to be discussed, every one of them ought to be debated. American people should have an opportunity to have their input through their own elected U.S. Senators. I would deeply regret it if this were somehow an indication that our majority leader intends to operate the senate this way, not only throughout the duration of this congress but into the next congress as well. I want to be clear that I have great respect and admiration for our majority leader. I’ve known him for most of my life, since I was 11 years old, in fact. I consider him a friend. I ask him, I implore him as my friend to reconsider this practice of filling the tree and thereby forestalling the instruction of amendments. We need an open amendment process.
Our status as the world's greatest deliberative legislative body requires nothing less. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: Lee Visits All 29 Utah Counties
Date: November 8, 2012

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY- Today, Senator Lee visited Sanpete County, accomplishing his goal of visiting all 29 Utah counties in the calendar year. In visiting more than 40 cities and towns across Utah, Senator Lee met with state representatives, local officials, business leaders, educators, military officials and hundreds of constituents about a range of issues that face Utahans and to offer solutions on how his office can help.  He also held eight town hall meetings where he answered questions and concerns and received direct feedback from attendees.
“Utah is a large state and not everyone has an opportunity to come to my offices in Salt Lake City, St. George, or Washington, D.C.,” said Lee. “It’s important that they have a chance to tell me in person how they think I’m doing and what changes they would like to see in Washington.
Lee used these visits to work with local officials and other stakeholders on a number of issues such as controlling the prairie dog population, land use designation, timber leasing, and the conservation of the Utah sage grouse.
The visits by Senator Lee compliment the Mobile Office program Lee began last year which sends a staff member to each county twice a year to hold an open forum for Utahns to reach out to Lee’s office.  The Mobile Office program achieved its goal earlier this year, 4 months ahead of schedule.
Senator Lee uses his weekends and Senate recesses to make the bulk of his county visits. He started on January 12
th
, visiting Utah and Weber Counties.  In February, he visited Daggett, Duchesne and Salt Lake counties. In April Lee visited Carbon, Grand, Emery and San Juan Counties. In May he visited Box Elder, Cache, Davis, Juab, Millard, Morgan, Rich, Summit and Wasatch Counties. In July he visited Iron County. In August he visited Beaver, Garfield, Kane, Piute, Sevier, Tooele, Washington and Wayne Counties and finished today with visits to the towns of Gunnison, Ephraim, Fairview and Moroni in Sanpete County.
Town Halls have given Senator Lee the unique opportunity to both hear the concerns of the people of Utah and explain why the issues he is fighting for are important to Utah and the country.

Title: Lee Statement on House Oversight Committee Hearing on Benghazi Attacks
Date: October 10, 2012

Content:
As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lee made the following statement in response to the House Oversight Committee's hearing today on the September 11 Benghazi attacks:
“I am tremendously disappointed by press reports that suggest the Obama administration relayed incomplete or inaccurate information to the American people following the attack at our embassy in Benghazi. While representatives of the White House went before the American people to describe the attacks as ‘spontaneous’ and the unfortunate result of protests over an anti-Islamic video on YouTube, the State Department says that it never believed that account, and did not reflect the information they were sending to the White House.
“The variance in accounts of the State Department and the White House is disturbing evidence of one of two things: either the White House never received the proper intelligence, showing gross ineptitude and major flaws in national security policy, or the White House actually had valid intelligence from the time the events occurred but willfully attempted to mislead the American people.  While the forthcoming evidence points to the latter, both possibilities show a tremendous failure of leadership and I look forward to reviewing the testimonies of State Department officials at todays hearing of the House Oversight committee.”

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee issued the following statement regarding the death of Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Ivie, who was killed yesterday at the Brian Terry Station near Naco, Arizona.
"Our hearts are heavy from the loss of Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Ivie, who was tragically killed yesterday while serving his country and his community. His death is a solemn  reminder of the selfless sacrifices made by our brave men and women in uniform every day.  It also brings home the often silent and unseen sacrifices made by the families of those who serve and protect this great nation. Nicholas grew up in Provo, Utah, so today we mourn the loss of a great American, and a great Utahn, a servant we thankfully and proudly call one of our own.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Ivie family during this time."

Title: Lee Satisfied With FTC Approval of EMI Merger
Date: September 21, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights subcommittee, today released the following statement regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s decision on the merger of recording labels Universal Music Group and EMI.
“I am satisfied with the FTC’s decision to allow Universal Music Group’s acquisition of recording label EMI.  In dynamic markets such as this one, in which innovation is constantly changing the means of production and distribution of music, government regulators must be careful not to intervene without evidence that a merger will harm consumers.  The FTC’s decision appears to be fact-based, well-reasoned, and focused on consumer welfare.  I trust that the acquisition of EMI will enable Universal’s labels and artists to continue recording, producing and distributing great music at a fair price.”

Title: Lee To Testify at Hearing on Obama’s Abuse of Power
Date: September 12, 2012

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) will testify at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on the “Obama Administration’s Abuse of Power.”
Senator Lee will discuss the essential duty of the legislature to ensure that the executive branch does not exceed its rightful authority, a duty that has become even more important with President Obama in office.
“In recent decades we have witnessed the executive branch claim for itself more and more government power.  But this trend has reached new, disturbing levels under the current administration.  President Obama has treated the Constitution’s separation of powers as if it were a matter of convenience that may be ignored when it gets in his way.  Rather than cooperating with Congress or respecting the Constitution’s separation of powers, he has in many instances chosen to go it alone and in the process has exceeded the proper bounds of executive power.”
Senator Lee will discuss President Obama’s unconstitutional recess appointments; his action to obstruct legislative oversight of his administration, including his abusive assertion of executive privilege with respect to Operation Fast & Furious documents; and his unilateral decision to issue an executive order contravening Congress’s immigration policy.
Senator Lee’s written testimony states, “As these examples demonstrate, when faced with opposition from Congress, President Obama has repeatedly sought to go it alone.  It is thus all the more necessary and important that Congress continue to exercise its constitutional role and check this President’s abuse of power.”
The hearing will stream live from
here
at 10am ET, and full text of Senator Lee’s testimony is attached.

Title: Lee to Host Inaugural Constitution Bowl
Date: September 11, 2012

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – On Friday, September 14, in celebration of the 225
th
Anniversary of the U.S. Constitution, Senator Mike Lee will host the first annual “Constitution Bowl.” The competition format is based on the game show “Jeopardy,” and will feature teams of students from four local youth councils including Taylorsville, Cottonwood Heights, North Salt Lake, and West Point.  Senator Lee will moderate the event and ask the “answers” along with Speaker of the House Rebecca Lockhart and Murray Mayor Dan Snarr.
“While most Americans are familiar with how the Constitution was created, too few know what our founding document says and what it really means,” said Sen. Lee, a former constitutional lawyer and clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. “This event is fun way to get students and the public to not only learn about the text of the Constitution and how our national, state, and local governments are structured, but also engage in a larger discussion about our founding principles and the proper role of government in our lives.”
The Utah League of Cities and Towns is cosponsoring the event and will award the winners with an all expenses paid trip to visit Washington, DC to meet with Senator Lee and visit various attractions in our nation’s capital.
“Students, their parents, small business owners, public officials, and Americans across the country are acutely aware of the many challenges our country faces.  The good news is that the solutions are found in the Constitution – that enduring document which has provided the roadmap for civil society for almost 225 years,” Lee added.  “I hope this annual event popularizes the Constitution in a way that reinforces the important role it still plays in determining America’s public policy and the direction of our country.”
The idea for the Constitution Bowl came to Sen. Lee while meeting with groups of students during several Town Hall Tours across the state.  “They were incredibly knowledgeable of and interested in America’s Founding and the principles behind the creation of our country.  I thought an event celebrating our Constitution that would be both fun and informative could capture that interest and broaden it for others throughout Utah.”
The event will be held at the Sheraton City Center in Salt Lake City on Friday, September 14, 2012 during lunchtime.

Title: Senators Introduce Bipartisan Pay for Printing Act
Date: August 3, 2012

Content:
Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators DeMint (R-South Carolina), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) are introducing the Pay for Printing Act, which would require senators to pay for celebratory or commemorative resolutions out of their own budgets, rather than using taxpayer funds.
“The printing of symbolic, nonbinding resolutions has gotten out of hand and it’s costing taxpayers more of their hard-earned dollars,” DeMint said. “This bipartisan legislation simply requires senators to take responsibility for paying for the cost of printing these symbolic resolutions out of their own office budgets. This will require senators to be more judicious with taxpayer dollars and hopefully cut down on many of these unnecessary resolutions.”
“Our bill is a common sense measure to remind all of us that if we can’t responsibly pay for the small things, then how are we going to do the big things necessary to finally get spending under control in Washington,” Corker said. “Members of Congress who introduce these commemorative resolutions should pay for them as a ceremonial function of their office, rather than adding them to the cost of government.”
During the 112th Congress alone the Senate has passed or agreed to more than 350 simple resolutions and introduced over 100 more. The overwhelming majority of these resolutions are commemorative or celebratory in nature.
Examples of these resolutions in the last year include National Chess Day, National Day of the American Cowboy, commemorating the 75th Anniversary of Ducks Unlimited, National Safe Digging Month, Year of Water, National Work and Family Month, commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the American Podiatric Medical Association, congratulating the Miami Heat for their NBA championship, celebrating Pacific Lutheran University Lutes Softball Team, and commending Yellow Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing Bonding.
These resolutions incur printing costs of about $1,200 per page. So far in the 112th Congress, simple resolutions may have already cost taxpayers nearly $400,000 in printing costs alone.
According to the Legislative Information System of Congress, the number of simple resolutions has nearly doubled over the past decade. In 2001-2002, the Senate of the 107th Congress passed 247 simple resolutions. In 2009-2010, the Senate of the 111th Congress passed 493.
The Pay for Printing Act requires that the sponsor of a simple resolution -- which is commemorative or celebratory in nature -- pay for the printing costs of his or her resolution. This money shall come from the sponsor’s Members’ Representative Allowance (MRA).
The Pay for Printing Act allows for an exemption for those resolutions with more than two-thirds of the Senate as sponsors.

Title: KOHL, LEE OUTLINE ANALYSIS OF UNIVERSAL-EMI MERGER IN LETTER TO FTC
Date: August 3, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Herb Kohl (D-WI) and Mike Lee (R-UT), chairman and ranking member of the Senate Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee, today outlined their analysis of the pending acquisition of EMI Group by Universal Music Group in a letter to the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is currently reviewing the merger.  The subcommittee convened a hearing on June 21, 2012 to consider the sale of EMI’s recorded music business to Universal, and its impact on competition, artists, and consumers.
“This letter summarizes the findings of our investigation into this transaction. In brief, without reaching any final judgment as to the legality of the deal under the antitrust laws, we believe this proposed acquisition presents significant competition issues that merit careful FTC review to ensure that the transaction is not likely to cause substantial harm to competition in the affected markets.  In the course of this review, we also urge the Commission to be mindful of the changes in the music industry in the last decade, particularly the shift to online distribution as the preferred way consumers purchase music,” the Senators wrote.

Title: Lee Introduces Cut, Cap, Balance Act
Date: August 1, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee reintroduced legislation with 21 cosponsors that would put the country on a path toward sound financial footing, significantly reduce the annual deficit and national debt, and require Congress to balance the federal budget.  The bill, known as “Cut, Cap, Balance,” would cut federal spending immediately, cap all future spending at sustainable levels, and demand that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution first pass Congress and be sent to the States before Congress raises the statutory debt limit.
“The country is on an unsustainable fiscal path,” said Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee and author of the consensus Republican Balanced Budget Amendment.  “Cut, Cap, Balance is the only plan with significant support in the House and Senate that will address our debt and deficits, control spending, and fundamentally change the way Washington does business.”
The legislation cuts $62 billion from discretionary spending in 2013, places caps on future spending over the next decade, and creates a glide path to balancing the budget by 2020.  It also effectively “turns off” the sequester – the massive spending cuts to domestic and defense programs due to trigger at the end of the year – by amending the Budget Control Act and offsetting the cost of the sequester with other cuts.
The bill is an updated version of last year’s “Cut, Cap, Balance Act” and reflects new budget numbers.  It currently has a growing list of 21 cosponsors in the Senate, and there are plans to introduce corresponding legislation in the House.  In a CNN poll conducted when the bill was introduced last year, 66% of the country supported the Cut, Cap, Balance plan.  The previous version of the plan passed easily in the House, but was then tabled by Majority Leader Harry Reid in the Senate.
“Congress has a spending problem and it’s our job to fix it. This plan does that,” said Lee. “It’s not right to ask the American people to pay for the debt Congress created, especially if it has not taken significant steps to reverse overspending.  We have to identify our priorities, set responsible spending levels to meet them, and eliminate the trillion dollar deficits that are sapping the economy of precious resources.  Cut, Cap, Balance moves us in the right direction so we can restore confidence in our economy, create jobs, and get the country moving again.”
Senator Lee’s bill is currently cosponsored by Sens. Paul (KY), DeMint (SC), Coburn (OK), Blunt (MO), Risch (ID), Toomey (PA), Graham (SC), Isakson (GA), Vitter (LA), Rubio (FL), Cornyn (TX), Crapo (ID), Johnson (WI), Alexander (TN), Chambliss (GA), Barrasso (WY), Inhoffe (OK), Hatch (UT), Boozman (AR), Wicker (MS), and Thune (SD). UPDATE: Senator Portman (OH) has joined the list of cosponsors.

Title: Lee: Senate Must Protect Its Institutional Rights and Impose the Leahy-Thurmond Rule
Date: July 30, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement in advance of the Senate's nominations vote this evening:
"The Constitution assigns to the Senate the right and duty to advise and consent to the President’s judicial nominees.  During President Obama’s term in office, the Senate has acted responsibly in carrying out this role.  Indeed, numerous measures demonstrate that the Senate has treated President Obama’s judicial nominees fairly, confirming them at a greater rate and more quickly than the Democratic Senate confirmed President Bush’s nominees.
"It is essential for the Constitution’s separation of powers that the Senate protect its legitimate role in the nominations process against encroachment by the executive branch.  To prevent a particular President from packing the courts at the end of his term by appointing influential life-tenured judges whose service will span numerous other presidential administrations, the Senate has traditionally ceased confirming federal appellate court nominees after the spring of a presidential election year.  This tradition and precedent is known as the Leahy-Thurmond rule.
"Many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have vigorously enforced the Leahy-Thurmond rule in past presidential-election years, and it makes sense that we apply that precedent today.  Indeed, we are already past the time at which the Senate traditionally enforces this rule.
"This year, applying the Leahy-Thurmond rule is justified for an additional reason.  On January 4, 2012, President Obama made four unprecedented and unconstitutional appointments to significant executive branch positions. The President made the appointments without the advice and consent of the Senate.  Although he asserted that the appointments were made pursuant to the Constitution’s Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate plainly was not in recess at the time of the appointments.
"In justifying his unconstitutional appointments, President Obama asserted that he may unilaterally decide when the Senate is and is not in session for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause.  This reckless assertion of executive power and encroachment on the legislative branch cannot go unchecked.  As duly sworn members of Congress, we have an institutional and constitutional duty to preserve and defend the rightful prerogatives of the legislative branch, particularly from the encroachments of the executive.

Title: Lee Opening Statement on DOJ Antitrust AAG Nominee Hearing
Date: July 26, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, delivered the following opening statement at a hearing for William Baer, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division:
"Today we consider the nomination of William Baer to be the next Assistant Attorney General over the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division.  This is a position of enormous significance.  Since its establishment nearly 80 years ago, the Antitrust Division, together with the Federal Trade Commission, has been tasked with the enforcement of our nation’s antitrust laws.
"As head of the Antitrust Division, the Assistant Attorney General oversees the Department’s criminal and civil enforcement of the antitrust laws, assisted by five Deputy Assistant Attorneys General and hundreds of attorneys and economists.  Over the past decade, the Division has conducted an average of 90 merger investigations and 28 non-merger investigations each year.  And over the last decade, the Division has levied $4.4 billion in fines on individuals and corporations.  Obviously, much is at stake as the Division establishes enforcement priorities, reviews mergers, investigates conduct, and litigates cases.
"The Antitrust Division’s charge is to administer our nation’s antitrust laws faithfully so as to safeguard our free-market economy.  Robust competition maximizes consumer welfare by ensuring access to a broad variety of products at low prices.  Competition is also essential to innovation, as businesses have access to markets and are able to secure a reasonable return on productive investments.
"There is much good—for the economy and for consumers—that can be accomplished through antitrust enforcement.  But there is also potential for abuse.  As a result, I believe the role of antitrust law is important, but limited.
"Although much of antitrust law is by necessity forward looking, unmoored speculation about the potential effects that a transaction may have on various markets must not be allowed to overtake fundamental economic analysis.
"Antitrust regulators must also be wary of attempts to subvert their investigation or review process to advance political objectives or private financial ends.  I believe the Division should resist efforts by politicians to encourage antitrust enforcement as a back-door means to implement desired policy outcomes.  Antitrust officials must also be on guard against the inevitable attempts of competitors to use the investigatory or enforcement process primarily to harm rivals.
"In short, antitrust officials must stay focused on the true purpose of the antitrust laws—to safeguard competition, rather than competitors, so as to maximize consumer welfare.
"The government has a proper role in ensuring that businesses compete fairly and do not collude.  Such enforcement can forestall the need for more burdensome regulatory structures that impose greater costs on our economy and society.  But it is improper for antitrust enforcers to pick winners and losers in the marketplace or to interfere with private enterprise where robust market forces are in operation.
"I look forward to discussing these principles with Mr. Baer as we consider his nomination."

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Address Wildfires
Date: July 20, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced legislation that would protect communities near federal lands that are at risk of catastrophic wildfire destruction.  The bill would expedite projects to reduce fuel loads on certain lands owned by the federal government through livestock grazing and timber management plans.  It reduces regulatory burdens on these projects while still allowing for reasonable public review and environmental analysis.
“The lives and livelihoods of affected communities are at risk by poor management of our public lands,” said Lee, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “The bill will allow federal agencies to implement fuel reduction projects to reduce the danger of catastrophic fires in the future and address a key component that caused much of the wildfire destruction we have seen recently.”
The “Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012” was first introduced in the House by Arizona Representative Paul Gosar (AZ-1) and has 31 cosponsors, including Utah Reps. Bishop and Matheson.
"I thank Senator Lee for joining me to push for this common sense solution that will prevent catastrophic fire conditions in our national forests," said Rep. Paul Gosar. "With nearly 900 forest fires having raged across the country, especially in Arizona, Utah and other western states, the legislation we've proposed will be crucial tools in fighting devastating wildfires. By removing the red tape and expediting the federal review process on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands we can better manage our forests and create rural jobs.  The gridlock between agencies must end.”
"The Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act empowers land managers to more dynamically manage our nation's public lands," said National Parks, Forests, and Public Land Subcommittee Chairman Rob Bishop.  "Timber harvests and livestock grazing are effective tools that when used responsibly can promote forest health and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire.  The Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act ensures that hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration activities are done in an efficient, effective, and environmentally responsible manner.  I'm grateful that Sen. Lee has introduced the Senate companion and look forward to the House consideration of the bill [HR 5744] before theSubcommittee Friday morning."
So far, nearly 400,000 acres of Utah land have burned this year.

Title: Lee: American People Shouldn’t Have To Pay For The Mess Congress Created
Date: July 18, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Lee warned of the consequences of letting the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire and spoke of the impact on families and businesses from massive tax increases.
“On Monday we heard from Democrats who insist that Congress must now raise taxes of the American people. In fact, they're so committed to this task that they're willing to take the country off the fiscal cliff in order to get their way,” Lee said.
“Congress has proven time and time again that the money it takes from the American people, from hardworking taxpayers, isn't always spent carefully. In fact, it's been spending more than it takes in for so long people almost can't remember a time when Congress routinely balanced its budget…[T]his is not the fault of the American people. And the job of fixing it lies right here in Congress,” he said.
“I'd argue that there is a certain irony in the president's proposal to increase taxes on some Americans while leaving the necessary tax relief in place for others. While purporting to help hardworking Americans, this approach would actually have the opposite effect, hurting many of those Americans who can least afford the hit right now.
“These are people who are living paycheck to paycheck. These are not C.E.O.s, these are not the top 1%. These are hardworking Americans that cannot afford to lose a job. We can't let a tax hike bring about that kind of terrible consequence.”
###
See Sen. Lee’s full remarks below:
LEE: On Monday we heard from Democrats who insist that Congress must now raise taxes of the American people. In fact, they're so committed to this task that they're willing to take the country off the fiscal cliff in order to get their way.
This is unfortunate. It's unnecessary and it's a course of action that we cannot pursue. Mind you, they're not trying to pursue comprehensive tax reform. No, they're not trying to fix this byzantine era of tax code, which occupies tens of thousands of pages. What they're doing instead is just to raise taxes right now so that they can get their way right now, so that they can cover their shortfall that exists right now because of a chronic failure by Congress over time to set and stick to spending priorities
Well, the vast majority of Republicans are committed not to raise taxes, not on anyone, and there are some very good reasons for this.
First, the federal government has proven its inadequacy in this area. Congress has proven time and time again that the money it takes from the American people, from hardworking taxpayers, isn't always spent carefully. In fact, it's been spending more than it takes in for so long people almost can't remember a time when Congress routinely balanced its budget. This is a problem. And it's a problem that shouldn't be fixed by taxing the same people who are already paying this bill even more. Now this is not the fault of the American people. And the job of fixing it lies right here in Congress, not with the American people.
Second, from the C.B.O. to the I.M.F. to the Federal Reserve to Ernst & Young, experts around the world are warning of the dire economic consequences that await us if we raise taxes. And we cannot allow it to happen. We've had over $4 trillion added to the national debt during this president's administration. At the same time we've had unemployment exceeding 8% for the last 41 consecutive months. Nearly 13 million Americans are currently out of work and millions more are underemployed and looking for more work. We can't allow this to continue.
I'd argue that there is a certain irony in the president's proposal to increase taxes on some Americans while leaving the necessary tax relief in place for others. While purporting to help hardworking Americans, this approach would actually have the opposite effect, hurting many of those Americans who can least afford the hit right now. A new study from Ernst & young reveals he that this tax hike, a tax hike that hits some Americans but not others, would kill 710,000 jobs. These are people who can't afford to lose their jobs. These are people who are living pay heck to paycheck. These are not C.E.O.s, these are not the top 1%. These are hardworking Americans that cannot afford to lose a job. We can't let a tax hike bring about that kind of terrible consequence.
Now, Democrats will assure you that their tax hikes are all about reducing the deficit. That's curious because their proposal would leave 94% of this year's deficit intact, which makes it an inherently unserious proposal insofar as it relates to deficit reduction. Further, the president's own ten-year budget, which includes massive tax increases, by the way, still adds $11 trillion to the national debt.
Now, I really do appreciate the fact that the president is finally talking about these issues, issues that have long gone unaddressed and need to be addressed. But he can't look the American people in the eye and tell them he's doing something about the debt when his own budget, while raising taxes, nearly doubles our already sprawling national debt over the next ten years.
Republicans have proposals. We have proposals to reform the tax code, to reduce the deficit and to do so in ways that will grow the economy, not cause it to contract. I've got an amendment that I hope we'll get to consider in the next week or two that would permanently keep tax rates at their current levels so that American families and businesses can know what to expect. It would also eliminate the death tax and it would stop the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, which is quickly becoming the middle-income penalty tax. These measures and others would go a long way, a long way toward improving our economy and getting the American people back to work again.
If my friends on the other side of the aisle disagree, as is their right to do, then let's come together and work to find some common ground. But these election-year antics and distractions are not what the American people sent us here to do. And the longer we wait before enacting real reform, the worse the problem is going to get.

Title: Lee Comments on Passing of Stephen Covey
Date: July 16, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee made the following comments regarding the passing of best-selling author Stephen Covey:
“Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Stephen Covey, who passed away this morning at age 79 in Idaho Falls. He was loved and respected by many and will most certainly be missed,” said Lee.
“He was an inspiration to millions, a revolutionary problem solver, and an icon for business managers everywhere.  It is impossible to calculate the immense amount of good that Stephen Covey did for so many people. His insight helped to shape the future of an untold number of businesses, resulting in better jobs and indeed better lives for people around the world.”
Covey was most well known for his 1989 book,
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
. He would go on to publish a series of books related to the “seven habits” theme, and sold more than 20 million copies in total. In 1996, Time magazine named him one of the 25 most influential Americans, and in 2011,
Time
magazine listed
Seven Habits
as one of the 25 most influential business management books. 2011 also saw Covey named as one of Thinkers50’s top 50 business leaders in the world.
Covey earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Utah, an MBA from Harvard, and a doctorate in religious education from BYU. He applied his business acumen to a long list of companies and government agencies, including Saturn, Proctor & Gamble, NASA, and the American Cancer society.
Covey also founded the Covey Leadership Center, based in Orem, Utah. The center expanded to 40 offices worldwide, and sold books, videos, tapes, conferences, and training to countless businesses before merging with Franklin Quest to become FranklinCovey.

Title: Lee Comments on Judiciary Hearing on Oversight
Date: July 11, 2012

WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statement regarding today's Senate Judiciary hearing, "Oversight of the Impact on Competition of Exclusion Orders to Enforce Standard-Essential Patents:"
"Today's Judiciary Committee hearing highlighted legitimate concerns about the availability of ITC exclusion orders in disputes involving standard-essential patents.  I am pleased that both the DOJ Antitrust Division and the FTC are committed to ensuring that those who have agreed to license such patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms are not able to use the threat of an exclusion order in an anticompetitive manner.  I join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle who believe these concerns deserve careful consideration as the ITC determines when the availability of exclusion orders are in the public interest."
Attached is a letter on this matter Senator Lee sent to the Chairman Deanna Okun of the International Trade Commission in June.

Title: Lee Statement on Affordable Care Act Ruling
Date: June 28, 2012

Content:
Today Senator Mike Lee issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act:
"Today’s Supreme Court decision is only a temporary and hollow victory for the Affordable Care Act.  The Supreme Court allowed the individual mandate to stand as a tax, but it concluded that Congress had exceeded its regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause by attempting to impose the individual mandate as a government directive.  The individual mandate is already highly unpopular, and it will become even more so as theAmerican people recognize it for what the Court deemed it to be—a tax on the middle class that coerces Americans into healthcare decisions they would not choose for themselves.
"Importantly, the Court today also held that the manner in which the Affordable Care Act sought to expand Medicaid violates the Constitution and our nation’s system of federalism.  The federal government may not bully the states into expanding Medicaid by threatening to take away all federal Medicaid funding.
"Today’s decision makes it all the more important—and likely—that the Affordable Care Act will be repealed after the elections this November.  It is essential that members of Congress, as the people’s elected representatives, act to protect individual liberty.  When we look back at today’s decision in the coming months and years, I believe it may ultimately be regarded not as a victory for the Affordable Care Act but instead as a recognition and validation of federalism, limited government, and the freedoms protected by our constitutional structure."

Title: The Universal Music Group/EMI Merger and the Future of Online Music
Date: June 21, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today highlighted the challenges facing the music industry and identified important issues relating the Universal Music Group’s proposed acquisition of EMI’s record label.
Lee, the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, noted concerns about the merger, which would reduce the number of major labels from four to three and give Universal a larger market share than either of the remaining majors. Lee also stated that competitive factors within the recorded music industry may counteract the potentially harmful effects of the merger and that the transaction may also have procompetitive effects.
Lee concluded by stating that “government regulators should be wary of intervening in rapidly changing and innovative markets.”
Remarks as prepared for delivery at today’s hearing on "The Universal Music Group/EMI Merger and the Future of Online Music” are available below.
Ranking Member statement as prepared for delivery
:
“The recorded music industry is both a staple of our popular culture and an essential element of our economy. The 40,000 businesses involved in the U.S. music industry employ over 100,000 people—including artists, managers, technicians, and record label staff.  And music can be big business.  Estimated revenues for the sale of recorded music in America now exceed $7 billion per year.
“The music industry is also changing rapidly.  Last year, digital sales surpassed physical sales for the first time.  Online retail and digital distribution services provide consumers unprecedented access to lesser-known artists who might otherwise have been unable to obtain a recording contract.  Digitization has opened the door to a new and diverse world of innovative platforms and modes of competition.  But the rise of digital music has also made illegal, pirated recordings readily accessible to anyone with a computer and an Internet connection.
“The future of online music is bright but uncertain.  Although Internet-based radio and other music services are growing at an impressive pace, some suggest that the Copyright Royalty Board’s rate-setting process is broken and should be reformed.  Whatever the nature of any such reforms, enforcement of our antitrust laws must be oriented to help foster innovative technologies and enhance consumer welfare.
“As the music industry attempts to traverse a changing technological and competitive landscape, some consolidation may be expected.  It therefore came as little surprise when Universal Music Group announced its intention to acquire EMI’s record label.  This announcement followed the 2007 transfer of EMI—which had suffered from sharply declining market share and enormous debt—to a private-equity firm and eventually to Citigroup.
“Many industry observers welcome the prospect of Universal taking full advantage of EMI’s artists and catalog, helping to revive an industry in the midst of some decline.  Universal’s productive use of EMI’s assets promises efficiencies that an equity firm or bank is unlikely to achieve.
“At the same time, some competitors and public interest groups note that a Universal/EMI merger would reduce the number of major labels from four to three and give Universal a larger market share than either of the remaining majors.  Critics fear that a combined Universal-EMI could leverage its market power to increase prices to retailers and consumers.  Some worry that the combined company may stifle innovation in emerging digital distribution models by refusing to license its catalog to inventive services.  Others also fear that a dominant label might seek to exclude competitors from accessing key promotional space in retail and digital distribution services.
“These concerns underscore the complex, evolving nature of the music industry and the need for careful analysis of the relevant markets and the manner in which market power might be exercised.  I am hopeful that this hearing will provide insight into the competitive landscape of the recorded music industry.
“Mergers play an essential role in our economy and should be permitted where they do not harm consumers.  Mergers can bring to bear superior managerial skills, allow for more productive use of underutilized assets, and result in economies of scale, reduced costs, improved quality, and increased output.  The potential for mergers generally provides positive incentives for industry managers, who recognize a need to maximize profits or face consolidation.  Likewise, innovators know there is an acquisition market for the businesses they create.
“Under most definitions of the relevant markets, this merger will result in a significant degree of concentration.  As the Merger Guidelines make clear, however, this is not the end of the analysis, and the merger may proceed where other competitive factors “counteract the potentially harmful effects of increased concentration.”
“Universal and other proponents of the merger assert that there is reason to believe such competitive factors are present in the various markets for recorded music.  Music retailers wield tremendous market power, with Apple and Wal-Mart alone accounting for up to 60 percent of sales.  This countervailing market power may well protect against labels successfully raising marginal prices.
“The nature of the modern music industry may provide an additional protection against anticompetitive effects.  The prevalence and affordability of technology has increased the ease of entry substantially, resulting in greater access—and an increased variety of access points, whether YouTube, MySpace, or iTunes—for artists and independent labels.  In fact, independent labels now account for approximately 30 percent of music ownership.
“Finally, at least at present, we cannot ignore the effect of pirated music.  The threat (and prevalence) of piracy surely impacts decision making throughout the legitimate recorded music industry, and therefore must be considered as part of any comprehensive antitrust analysis.
“Government regulators should be wary of intervening in rapidly changing and innovative markets.  The music industry has experienced much turmoil as it has struggled to adjust to changes in technology, pricing models, and consumer expectations.  Gone are the days when consumers bought entire albums in order to acquire a single song.  Also gone are the days when consumers purchased the same album a second time simply to update their libraries to the latest format.  Today, record labels and the artists they represent have their work stolen and shared freely over the Internet.  Every year consumers demand more music for less money.  As the music industry grapples with these and other challenges, government regulators ought to be careful not to prohibit reasonable business judgments and decisions that may lead to efficiencies and productive solutions.
“I look forward to hearing the testimony of the witnesses and thank them for being here today.”

Title: Lee Backs Calls for Enforcing “Leahy-Thurmond Rule” on Judges
Date: June 14, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to reports that Senate Republicans would begin enforcing the “Leahy-Thurmond Rule,” an historic practice in presidential years when the Senate stops confirming certain judicial nominees.
“I am pleased that the Republican caucus has decided to enforce the Leahy-Thurmond rule and cease confirming appeals court nominees until after the presidential election,” said Lee, a member of the Judiciary Committee.  “It is particularly important that we do so now in light of the unconstitutional ‘recess’ appointments President Obama made earlier this year.  The President must be held accountable for his unprecedented and illegitimate assertion that he may unilaterally determine when the Senate is in session.  I join Leader McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others in opposing President Obama’s abuse of power and curtailing additional appellate confirmations between now and the election.”

Title: Lee Opposes Nomination of Andrew Hurwitz
Date: June 12, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee spoke on the Senate floor opposing the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Senator Lee noted that Mr. Hurwitz has closely associated himself with the misguided reasoning behind the controversial abortion rights decision in Roe v. Wade.
“Mr. Hurwitz fails to appreciate that Roe represents exactly the kind of constitutional activism federal courts must avoid—inventing new rights without any substantive or significant constitutional analysis,” said Lee who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Mr. Hurwitz’s attempt to take credit for—and subsequent refusal to distance himself from—constitutional decisions that lack serious constitutional foundation casts an unacceptable degree of doubt on his ability to serve in the role of a federal appellate judge.”
He added: “Of the countless qualified judges and attorneys who would make for excellent appellate judges to serve in the Ninth Circuit, President Obama had to choose the one candidate who by his own account was one of the key intellectual architects of the profoundly flawed legal arguments in Roe v. Wade, and who even today looks back on his role in that case with pride.”
Senator Lee’s full remarks on the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz
:
Floor Speech on Nomination of Andrew Hurwitz
June 11, 2012
Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
I would first note that this year we have already confirmed 25 of President Obama’s judicial nominees.  At this point in 2004—the last presidential election year during a President’s first term—the Senate had confirmed only 11 of President Bush’s judicial nominees.  At the same point in 1996, during President Clinton’s first term, the Senate had confirmed only 3 judicial nominees.  So this year we have confirmed more than twice as many of President Obama’s judicial nominees as we did during a comparable period for President Bush, and more than 8 times as many as we did for President Clinton.
Of the nominees we have already confirmed so far this year, two are now serving as appellate judges on the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit is an important appellate court, with jurisdiction over 60 million Americans—20 percent of our country’s total population.  And approximately 1/3 of all the reversals handed down by the Supreme Court last term were from the Ninth Circuit.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has developed something of a reputation for eccentric legal theories and unusual results.  As one commentator suggested: “There should be two Supreme Courts, one to reverse the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the other to hear all other cases.”
We should therefore exercise some caution in confirming yet another liberal nominee to the Ninth Circuit.  But Mr. Hurwitz is not simply another liberal nominee.  Mr. Hurwitz has sought to claim credit for one of the most controversial and constitutionally indefensible decisions in Supreme Court history—Roe v. Wade.
In 1972, Mr. Hurwitz clerked for Judge Jon Newman on the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  That year, as Mr. Hurwitz put it, “[t]he abortion issue dominated [Judge Newman’s time],” and Mr. Hurwitz helped Judge Newman write two key abortion decisions known as Abele I and Abele II.  These decisions established the conceptual groundwork for Roe v. Wade.  They relied on a single, discredited historical account to conclude that Connecticut’s abortion laws were not passed to protect the life of the fetus; they relied on flawed science to conclude that there was no objective way of knowing when human life begins; and they relied on a fabricated and arbitrary legal framework of viability to analyze the competing rights of the individual and the state.
Given the woefully misguided reasoning behind these decisions, one would assume that a former law clerk would keep quiet about his personal role in drafting opinions that lack serious constitutional grounding.  Indeed, most former law clerks—who have a duty not to discuss internal deliberations—would consider themselves ethically bound not to talk about decision making in individual cases, and certainly would not seek to attract public attention to their role in particular decisions.  But Mr. Hurwitz did just that.
In a 2002 law review article, Mr. Hurwitz recounted how he received a Supreme Court clerkship partly on the basis of his role in helping draft Judge Newman’s 1972 abortion decisions.  Mr. Hurwitz wrote that Justice Potter Stewart, who hired Mr. Hurwitz as a clerk, “jokingly referred to [Hurwitz] as ‘the clerk who wrote the Newman [abortion] opinion.’” And Mr. Hurwitz made clear that the opinion had a “demonstrable effect” on the Supreme Court’s approach to abortion.
My concern with respect to Mr. Hurwitz’s asserted role in Roe v. Wade goes beyond his attempt to take credit for that decision.
Mr. Hurwitz has been nominated to serve as a federal appellate judge and his endorsement of the reasoning underlying Roe v. Wade raises immense concerns about his constitutional jurisprudence.  While Mr. Hurwitz continues to write about Roe with fondness, nostalgia, and even pride, most legal scholars—including many who hold very liberal political views—concede that Roe was an extraordinarily flawed legal decision.  For example:
Professor John Hart Ely has written: “[Roe v. Wade] is bad because it is bad constitutional law, or rather because it is not constitutional law [at all] and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”
Professor Laurence Tribe has written: “[B]ehind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which [Roe] rests is nowhere to be found.”
Professor Akhil Amar has written: “Roe’s main emphasis is neither textual, nor historical, nor structural, nor prudential, nor ethical: it is doctrinal.  But here too it is a rather unimpressive effort.  As a precedent-follower, Roe simply string-cites a series of privacy cases . . . and then abruptly announces with no doctrinal analysis that this privacy right is broad enough to encompass abortion.”
Professor Cass Sunstein has written: “In the Court’s first confrontation with the abortion issue, it . . . decided too many issues too quickly. The Court should have allowed the democratic processes of the states to adapt and to generate solutions that might not occur to judges.”
Unlike these liberal legal scholars, Mr. Hurwitz fails to appreciate that Roe represents exactly the kind of constitutional activism federal courts must avoid—inventing new rights without any substantive or significant constitutional analysis.
Given the chance at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to disassociate himself from Roe v. Wade, Mr. Hurwitz did not do so.  Instead, his only relevant response—an assertion also unpersuasively made by some of my colleagues—has been that his 2002 law review article was merely descriptive and did not express a personal opinion as to the merits of Roe.  But to anyone who has reviewed Mr. Hurwitz’s article and the laudatory tone with which it discusses the connection between Judge Newman’s opinions and Roe v. Wade, this assertion simply is not credible.  Mr. Hurwitz wrote that Judge Newman’s opinions on abortion were “memorable,” “innovative,” “careful and meticulous.”  And he described them as exerting a “profound,” “critical,” “immediate,” “direct,” and “crucial” influence on Roe v. Wade, which he described as a “landmark opinion of the Supreme Court.”
Mr. Hurwtiz cannot have it both ways.  He cannot seek credit for his role developing a jurisprudence that is unmoored from the Constitution and that has fundamentally disrespected human life, and then later claim that he was only retelling a story.  Mr. Hurwitz’s attempt to take credit for—and subsequent refusal to distance himself from—constitutional decisions that lack serious constitutional foundation casts an unacceptable degree of doubt on his ability to serve in the role of a federal appellate judge.
Of the countless qualified individuals who would make excellent appellate judges, President Obama chose to nominate the one person who by his own account was a key intellectual architect of the profoundly flawed legal arguments in Roe v. Wade—someone who fails to appreciate the illegitimacy of constitutional activism and who even today looks back on his role in that case with pride.
It is for this reason I urge all my colleagues to vote against the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz.

Title: Poll: Overwhelming Majority Still Opposes Unconstitutional Mandate
Date: June 5, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – A new poll shows Americans overwhelmingly continue to oppose a provision of the president’s signature legislation, ObamaCare, which would require individuals to purchase health insurance.  According to the United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, 74% of the American people would “like to see” the individual mandate struck down by the Supreme Court.  Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) reacted to the survey results today:
“The American people have overwhelmingly rejected what Barack Obama considers the signature accomplishment of his presidency. The survey shows Americans believe they have the right to make their own health care and health insurance decisions without federal mandates and other government intrusions,” said Lee, who predicted last March that the Supreme Court would strike down ObamaCare as a result of the constitutional problems associated with the individual mandate.
“Citizens across the country understand this issue is more than a debate over health insurance reform.  If the individual mandate is allowed to stand, there will be few conceivable constraints on the power of the federal government, and Americans fervently oppose that outcome. Three out of four Americans are on the side of restoring constitutionally limited government and putting the power back in the hands of the people.”
The survey of 1012 adults nationwide was conducted May 31 – June 3 and has a margin of error of 3.7%.

Title: Lee: Verizon/Cable Deal Appears Procompetitive and Likely to Benefit Consumers
Date: May 24, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee sent a letter to the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission regarding the recent deal between Verizon Wireless and several cable companies.  The agreements include the transfer of wireless spectrum to Verizon, cross-marketing arrangements between the companies, a joint research and development project, and a future option for the cable companies to create their own wireless offering using Verizon’s network capabilities.
"Vigorous competition is essential to consumer welfare in the wireless and cable markets,” said Senator Lee.  “Based on available evidence, I do not believe the spectrum purchase or commercial agreements will restrict competition or otherwise harm consumers.  To the contrary, the evidence suggests that these agreements are primarily procompetitive and will benefit consumers by putting previously fallow spectrum to efficient use, expanding consumer choice through the introduction of a new bundled offering, and spurring innovation in the development of new technologies and products.”
Senator Lee noted that “the spectrum Verizon seeks to purchase has not been in use since it was last transferred in 2006, and it is undisputed that Verizon employs spectrum productively and efficiently.  The proposed transaction thus creates an obvious efficiency and is, at its most fundamental level, procompetitive.”
Regarding the companies’ cross-selling agreement, Senator Lee noted that “collaboration among competitors is essential to a vibrant economy,” and that Verizon Communications Inc.’s “overwhelming economic incentives obviate any realistic possibility of a collusive agreement between FiOS and the cable companies to stand down.”
With respect to the parties’ joint research and development project, Senator Lee stated that “joint ventures often produce procompetitive effects,” and noted that “the parties’ joint operating entity, which seeks to develop new and innovative technologies, is procompetitive on its face.”
Senator Lee concluded by observing: “Although antitrust law is by its very nature forward looking, unmoored speculation must not be allowed to overtake rational economic analysis.  Government may sometimes have a proper role in ensuring that businesses compete fairly and do not collude.  But it is improper for government agencies to pick winners and losers in the marketplace or to interfere with private enterprise where robust market forces are in operation.”

Title: Senator Lee presses FBI Director Mueller on detention and surveillance of U.S. citizens
Date: May 16, 2012

Content:
At a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing this morning, Senator Lee questioned FBI Director Mueller on the potential for indefinite detention of U.S. citizens under the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.  Director Mueller agreed that the government should not be allowed to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely without charge or trial.
Senator Lee explained that although the current administration has stated it will not detain U.S. citizens without charge or trial, legislation is essential to ensure that this administration does not change its policy and that such detention does not occur in future administrations.  Senator Lee is an original co-sponsor of The Due Process Guarantee Act (S.2003), which provides: “An authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States, unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention.”  The bill currently has 29 cosponsors in the Senate.
At the hearing today, Senator Lee also expressed concerns about the broad categories of surveillance authorized by the 2008 Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  Senator Lee noted the importance of ensuring that FISA not be used for unwarranted surveillance of U.S. citizens.  As Congress considers reauthorizing the FISA Amendments, Senator Lee will continue to work to ensure that the constitutional rights and civil liberties of Americans are protected.

The full text of Senator Lee’s speech is provided below, and can be watched here.
“It's time that we wind down the Export-Import Bank, and my amendment, amendment number 2100, would do precisely that. The American people cannot be the world's financial backstop. The government shouldn't be picking winners and losers. Businesses in Utah and across the country are not receiving government help and are shutting their doors after decades serving their communities. We should not through this government be adding insult to injury by using tax money they contributed to prop up companies overseas.
“We need to end the corporate welfare that distorts the market and feeds crony capitalism. The corporations that largely benefit from the Ex-Im Bank should have no trouble marshaling their resources to compete in today's economy. If they are struggling, then they are most likely not deserving of taxpayer help, and if they are turning billions in profit, then they clearly do not need taxpayer-subsidized loans.
“Further, government subsidies breed undue favoritism from government bureaucrats who control where the money goes. Unless we want more Solyndras, we should end the practice immediately.
“Some have suggested that the Ex-Im bank is good for businesses. Mr. President, what's best for American businesses is getting the federal government out of their way, letting them operate without burdensome government regulations and without a complex tax system. Having the government pick winners and losers does not make industries stronger and makes them more dependent on subsidies, and when government is picking who wins, the loser is always the taxpayer.
“We have an opportunity today to reverse the status quo and defend the American taxpayer. My amendment winds down the Ex-Im Bank. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, amendment number 2100. Thank you, Mr. President.”

Title: Lee Defends Record on Judicial Nominations
Date: May 9, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee blasted the White House for misleading the public on the issue of judicial vacancies and defended Republicans’ record on moving forward with President Obama’s nominations.
“[J]udicial vacancies are down 20 percent from last year and are at the lowest level in nearly three years,” Lee said during his opening remarks at a Judiciary Committee hearing today. “The vast majority of current vacancies remain for one reason -- President Obama simply has not nominated individuals for those judgeships.”
The President has only made 29 nominations for 76 currently outstanding judicial vacancies, and many of the existing nominations are so new they have not yet had the opportunity to be vetted by the Judiciary Committee.
Lee also questioned White House claims of “unprecedented filibusters” by Republicans.  “During President Bush’s first three years, Senate Democrats forced 19 cloture votes on judicial nominees—19 votes to filibuster judges.  During President Obama’s first three years the Senate took only 6 such votes.”
Full transcript of Senator Lee’s remarks:
Nominations Hearing
May 9, 2012
Senator Mike Lee
I would like to say a brief word about statements made in recent days by the White House and some of my Democratic colleagues regarding judicial nominations.
There has been suggestion of “record judicial vacancies” resulting from “unwarranted obstruction” in the Senate by means of “unprecedented delays and filibusters.”
Of course, none of this happens to be true.  I would like to set the record straight.
The reality is that judicial vacancies are down 20 percent from last year and are at the lowest level in nearly three years.
The vast majority of current vacancies remain for one reason -- President Obama simply has not nominated individuals for those judgeships.   With respect to the current 76 judicial vacancies, the Obama administration has made only 29 nominations.
And I would note that a number of these nominations are so recent that the Judiciary Committee hasn’t even had a chance to hold hearings.  We are doing so today for 5 recent nominees.
The Senate has already confirmed more than 80 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees, approving a larger share without a roll call vote than under President Bush.
To date, the Senate has confirmed 143 of President Obama’s district and circuit judges.  That is significantly more judicial confirmations in the first three or so years of the Obama administration than the 120 we confirmed during the previous four years of President Bush’s second term.
And we continue to confirm more.  So far this year we are well above historical standards.  The average number of confirmations by May 9 for a presidential election year is 11.  We have already confirmed 21 judges this year.  That’s almost double the normal pace.
Finally, the suggestion of “unprecedented filibusters” is simply ridiculous.  During President Bush’s first three years, Senate Democrats forced 19 cloture votes on judicial nominees—19 votes to filibuster judges.  During President Obama’s first three years the Senate took only 6 such votes.
We have treated President Obama’s nominees better than the Democrats treated President Bush’s nominees.  For the White House or Senate Democrats to suggest otherwise is false and hypocritical.

Title: Lee Introduces Act to Balance Land Designation Authority
Date: May 7, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee introduced the Federal Land Designation Requirements Act of 2012, which would limit the federal government’s power to make a variety of land designations, including national parks, national monuments, and national recreation areas. The bill requires the approval of the state legislature before the federal government can make any federal land designation.
“Federal and state authority must be balanced if we are to have successful land use policies,” said Senator Lee. “Too often, the federal government ignores the people’s rights to determine for themselves how best to utilize their own land. States with smaller populations, like Utah, end up with only a limited voice in Congress.  The process should include greater protections for states and local communities against unwanted and often economically damaging decisions.
“Requiring the federal government and state governments to agree on proper land designation balances the interests of all involved without interfering with the protection of areas that truly deserve protection.“
The bill is currently cosponsored by Senators John Barasso (R-WY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Rand Paul (R-KY).

Title: Lee's Mobile Office Visits All 29 Counties
Date: May 3, 2012

Content:
Last week, Senator Mike Lee’s Mobile Office completed the first round of its visits to towns and cities in each county in the state of Utah. The Mobile Office is run by Senator Lee’s Community Outreach Director, D. Gary Beck, CAPT, USCG (Ret), and it allows the senator to provide Utahns who might not otherwise be able to interact with him or his staff in the Salt Lake City, St. George or Washington D.C. offices a way to do so in or near their local communities throughout Utah. Since its creation late last year, the Mobile Office has visited 54 cities and towns, and has provided service to 599 constituents.
“The Mobile Office has been tremendously successful, and I am very proud to say that it has made stops in every single county in Utah,” said Senator Lee. “Our goal was to do so within a year and we did it within six months. It’s important that citizens in every part of the state have the opportunity to voice their issues without having to drive hundreds of miles.

Title: Lee: VAWA Oversteps Limits on Federal Power
Date: April 26, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee made the following remarks on the floor of the Senate regarding the “Violence Against Women” Act (Watch full video here):
“
I rise today to speak about our Constitution’s federalist structure and the real danger of the federal government unduly interfering with the ability of states and localities to address activities and concerns in their communities.
“Everyone agrees that violence against women is reprehensible.  The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization has the honorable goal of assisting victims of domestic violence, but it oversteps the Constitution’s rightful limits on federal power, it interferes with the flexibility states and localities should have in tailoring programs to meet particular needs of individual communities, and it fails to address problems of duplication and inefficiency.
“First, violent crimes are regulated and enforced almost exclusively by state governments.  In fact, domestic violence is one of the few activities that the Supreme Court of the United States has specifically said Congress may not regulate under the Commerce Clause.  As a matter of constitutional policy, Congress should not seek to impose rules and standards as conditions for federal funding in areas where the federal government lacks constitutional authority to regulate directly.
“Second, the strings that Congress attaches to federal funding in the VAWA reauthorization restrict each state’s ability to govern itself.  Rather than interfering with state and local programs under the guise of spending federal tax dollars, Congress should allow states and localities to exercise their rightful responsibility over domestic violence.  State and local leaders should have flexibility in enforcing state law and tailoring victims’ services to the individualized needs of their communities, rather than having to comply with one-size-fits-all federal requirements.
“Third, even if the federal government had a legitimate role in administering VAWA grant programs, the current reauthorization fails to address many instances of duplication and overlap among VAWA and other programs operated by the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services.  Nor does it address the grant management failings identified by the Government Accountability Office.
“My opposition to the current VAWA reauthorization is a vote against big government and inefficient spending, and a vote in favor of state autonomy and local control.  We must not allow a desire by some to score political points and an appetite for federal spending to prevent states and localities from efficiently and effectively serving women and other victims of domestic violence.”

Title: Lee Responds to Interior Secretary’s Comments on Utah Lands
Date: April 25, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to comments made yesterday by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar regarding recent Utah state land transfer legislation.  The bill sets a deadline for the federal government to transfer all lands not designated as “wilderness” or as a national park to state control by 2014.  In a statement during a campaign-style press conference in Washington D.C., Salazar suggested Utah state legislators were not serious about the land transfer, calling it “political rhetoric you see in an election year.”
“The White House remains in full campaign mode spending taxpayer funds to rally their political base with events such as yesterday’s press conference with Secretary Salazar,” said Lee, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “But let me assure the Secretary and the President that Utahns and their representatives could not be more serious about protecting our land rights and preventing federal land grabs.
“More than two-thirds of all the land within Utah’s borders is owned by the federal government, which makes it very difficult to grow our state economy, pay for education, and create new opportunities for Utahns.  The President and his advisers like to talk about “fairness,” yet how fair is it that the state of Utah must ask for federal permission to use the vast majority of their own land?
“Thankfully, states like Arizona are joining Utah in standing up for their rights and I certainly expect more to support our effort soon.
“Frankly, given the President’s terrible record on energy security, exploration and development, gas prices, and property rights, it is not surprising he would want to distract attention from his failed and economy-crippling policies and inject politics into these important issues. But we will not let him hide from his decisions that hurting families and communities.”

Title: Lee Backs Pick To Defend Against Unconstitutional Appointments
Date: April 17, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement today in response to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's announcement that former Assistant to the Solicitor General Miguel Estrada will file an amicus brief on behalf of Senate Republicans. The brief will challenge the constitutionality of President Obama's "recess" appointments to the National Labor Relations Board in January.
"I commend Leader McConnell for having chosen Miguel Estrada, a superb advocate, to articulate the Senate’s crucial perspective in the litigation over President Obama’s unconstitutional “recess” appointments.  At stake is nothing less than the Senate’s rightful constitutional prerogatives.
"Although the federal courts may provide an important safeguard against presidential encroachment on the legislative branch, the Senate must not rely on the courts alone.  We must act independently to make clear that the President may not bypass the Senate’s advice and consent role as set forth in Article II, Section II of the Constitution.  President Obama’s unconstitutional appointments are fundamentally different than the recess appointments of any other president in our nation’s history.  President Obama unilaterally appointed individuals to important executive positions when the Senate was not in recess, asserting that he may independently determine when the Senate is and is not in session.
"This exceptional and unprecedented attack on the Constitution’s balance of powers threatens the system of checks and balances that protects our liberty.  In addition to supporting in the courts the efforts of those harmed by President Obama’s actions, the Senate itself must take action to make clear that unconstitutional executive aggrandizement will not stand."

Title: LEE: “Buffett Rule” Attempting to Divide, Distract Americans
Date: April 12, 2012

Content:
NEW YORK – Last night, Senator Mike Lee discussed President Obama’s push to distract Americans with the “Buffett Rule,” legislation that raises taxes on job creators and ignores the need for comprehensive tax reform.
LEE: “To what end is the right question to be asking because [the Buffett Rule] doesn’t solve our jobs problem. It does not solve our debt problem, our deficit problem. It does not solve the problem associated with increased fuel prices…This does not solve any of the problems that are of most concern to Americans.
“Americans want jobs, they want to be able to afford their way of life. They don't need a president coming in and try to divide Americans, to pit one group of Americans against another in a way that won't solve anything we're facing right now.  And that is why we see this as a cynical campaign-year effort to distract attention away from the fact that our economy is in trouble, in part because our government is simply too big and expensive.”
“We are talking about four or five billion per year, which is a lot of money, but a tiny drop in the bucket when we look at our overall budget, our annual deficit. This is a tiny amount. It won't perceptively change anyone's tax burden, not anyone's. But what it will do, what it very likely could do, is chill exactly the kind of economic activity we desperately need in this country: investment; people with money putting their capital at risk so as to create jobs.”

Title: Lee: DOJ Complaint Raises Serious Issues
Date: April 11, 2012

WASHINGTON – Today, Antitrust Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Mike Lee made the following statement regarding the Department of Justice’s announcement of a lawsuit against several book publishers and Apple, Inc. alleging that the companies conspired to raise prices for e-books:
"The proper focus of our antitrust laws is consumer welfare.  Although government regulators should not interfere with market forces absent a significant threat to competition, the allegations made in the complaint filed today by the Department of Justice raise serious concerns about the prices paid by consumers for e-books.  Illegal price fixing harms consumers and must not be tolerated.  I am confident the judicial process will properly resolve this matter and curtail any illegal actions that result in significant consumer harm."

Title: Senator Lee Commends FTC’s Careful Analysis
Date: April 2, 2012

Content:
“Our antitrust laws serve important purposes, but federal regulators should not interfere with productive market forces absent evidence demonstrating a significant threat to consumer welfare.  Based on the evidence presented at our Antitrust Subcommittee hearing, I am convinced that although significant in size this merger does not pose a threat to robust competition.  I am pleased that the FTC’s extensive investigation corroborated my view and demonstrated that this transaction is unlikely to have adverse affects on the PBM and specialty drug markets or lead to the exercise of monopsony power over retail pharmacies, and that the merger may well lead to lower prices for PBM services.”

Title: Lee Introduces the Federal Reserve Modernization Act
Date: March 29, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced legislation that would make much needed reforms to the nation’s Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Modernization Act (FRMA) will focus the Fed’s mission on price stability, require better reporting and make the organization more transparent to Americans.
“The Federal Reserve has experienced significant mission creep since its establishment in 1913, particularly in recent years where it has been involved in multi-trillion dollar bailouts and reckless easy money policies that created asset bubbles in the stock and real estate markets,” said Sen. Lee, a member of the Joint Economic Committee.  “The Constitution grants Congress the power to oversee the implementation of sound monetary policy. It is an area that receives too little attention even though it has a great impact on our economy.”
Specifically, FRMA would:
Replace the Fed’s dual mandate with a single mandate for achieving price stability;
Make the Fed articulate its lender-of-last-resort policy;
Extend permanent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voting membership to all regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents;
Allow the Fed to release its meeting transcripts within three years to increase transparency;
Require the Fed report on the impact of FOMC policies on the exchange rate value of the U.S. dollar;
Have the Fed invest only in Treasuries, repos and reverse repos, except during emergencies; and
Require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be funded through regular Congressional appropriations.
Of 47 major countries, including all G-7 and OECD countries, the U.S. is one of only two countries (Canada being the other) that do not have a single mandate for price stability or a primary mandate for price stability.  Price stability is key to growth and jobs because it encourages employers to invest and create jobs.

Title: Lee Reacts to Oral Argument on Individual Mandate
Date: March 27, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, after attending oral argument on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in ObamaCare, Senator Mike Lee made the following remarks:
“Oral arguments revealed the four traditionally conservative members — Chief Justice Roberts,  and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito — are almost certain to vote to strike down the individual mandate, and that Justice Kennedy is likely to agree with them,” said Lee, who once served as a Supreme Court clerk and is now a member of the Judiciary Committee. “The Obama administration’s argument that the federal government can compel citizens to purchase health insurance did not appear to sway these five justices, and their questions to the Solicitor General suggested they look on the constitutionality of the individual mandate with great skepticism.  It will be interesting to see how the justices respond to the 'severability’ arguments tomorrow, which will determine whether some or all of the law is struck down.  But there is little doubt that the individual mandate will not survive.”

Title: Senators Unveil Bipartisan Proposal to Boost Economy by Cutting Through Red Tape that has Hurt International Travel to U.S.
Date: March 26, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC—With the economy just starting to turn the corner, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a new proposal Monday that will boost the U.S. economy and create jobs by jumpstarting international travel to the United States. The legislation—named the Jobs Originated through Launching Travel (“JOLT”) Act—will reform outdated visa laws to cut through red tape that has caused a lag in foreign travel to the U.S.
The bipartisan package is sponsored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer, Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, Marco Rubio, Barbara Mikulski, Roy Blunt and Mark Kirk.
While the global travel market is expected to double over the next decade, the United States’ market share of this industry has declined by 5% since the 2000. The JOLT Act is aimed at reversing that trend and recapturing the United States’ historic share of worldwide overseas travel, which could add nearly $100 billion to the economy over the next decade and create nearly 700,000 more American jobs.
The JOLT Act will be the subject of a Senate hearing tomorrow, Tuesday, March 27th.
“With the global travel market set to dramatically increase in the coming years, it is critical that we harness its power to boost our travel and tourism industries,” said Senator Schumer. “This bipartisan proposal will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the next decade and inject billions of dollars into our country’s economy. It is extremely important and vastly beneficial to our nation’s health.”
“Legal travel and legal immigration are too often left out of the ongoing immigration debate we are having in this country,” said Senator Lee. “We cannot ignore the benefits we enjoy by maintaining an efficient visa system that keeps us safe while avoiding excessive delays to legitimate travel across our borders. This bill will modernize that system.”
“Tourism is a powerful engine for job creation in Minnesota and across the country, and the growing international tourism market has huge untapped potential for local economies,” said Senator Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees the tourism industry and serves as Co-Chair of the Senate Tourism Caucus. “This legislation will help cut through the red tape that has been limiting international tourism the United States and help our businesses grow and thrive.”
“Increasing international tourism to the United States will have a very important impact on our nation’s future economic growth,” said Senator Rubio. “Congress needs to pass legislation that will reduce unnecessary roadblocks that cause many international tourists to choose to travel to other countries. At the same time, we must implement policies that reinforce and strengthen the security of our nation from outside threats. The JOLT Act accomplishes both of these goals and it allows the United States to become more competitive in the global travel market. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this bill and I urge my Senate colleagues to join in the effort to pass this bill.”
“The JOLT Act improves the Visa Waiver Program and will create and sustain American jobs. It strengthens our alliances, enhances our security, and allows millions to visit the United States and spend their money here,” said Senator Mikulski. “A grandmother from Gdansk shouldn’t need a visa to visit her grandkids in Baltimore. I’ve fought for years to ensure that we expand this important program in a way that keeps our borders secure while allowing travelers who want nothing other than to see family, conduct business, or tour our great country to do so without going through a long and expensive process. This bill updates the Visa Waiver Program so that our State Department may direct limited consular resources where they are needed most to keep our country safe and secure.”
“At a time when we’re facing lagging job growth, boosting our tourism industry will help to jumpstart much-needed job creation and spur economic opportunity in Missouri and nationwide,” said Senator Blunt. “This bill is an important step in the right direction, and I was glad to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we work to cut through the red tape and encourage more international travel to the United States. By streamlining our visa processing system without jeopardizing our nation’s security, we can welcome more international visitors and provide new opportunities for private sector job creators.”
“Despite its strong support for the United States, Poland remains one of the only major democratic U.S. allies to be excluded from the Visa Waiver Program," a spokesperson for Senator Kirk said. "This legislation would fulfill the President’s commitment to a strong democratic ally and bring Poland into the Visa Waiver Program while providing a needed boost to America’s tourism industry.  Tourism supported more than 100,000 jobs and brought more than $10 billion to Illinois last year alone. Common sense updates to the Visa Waiver Program are overdue and this bipartisan approach should move through Congress quickly."
International travel to the United States represents a significant component of the United States’ economy. Studies show that, on average, each overseas visitor spends about $4,000 in America per visit. In 2011, foreign nationals spent more than $134 billion total in travel to America. This spending supported 1.8 million American jobs, and represented 8.7 percent of U.S. exports of goods and services. However, in the past ten years the United States market share of worldwide overseas travel market has dropped from a 17 percent share to less than 12 percent.
The senators highlighted that a key reason for that is the United States’ inefficient and antiquated visa system, which is highly uncertain, lengthy and costly. Under current law, the wait time for U.S. visas can be as long as 100 days for travelers from certain countries. In addition, the $140 visa application fee is non-refundable, and must often be combined with other costs such as travel to distant consulates and lost work time—all of which makes travel to America less appealing.
The JOLT Act aims to encourage the State Department to issue Chinese visitor visas that last longer than the current 1-year maximum; permit Canadian “snowbird” visitors to stay in the United States for an additional 60 days per year; and change the visa fee structure to spread the demand for visas evenly across all four seasons, increasing total visa numbers. The legislation also would allow Customs and Border Protection to add important foreign dignitaries to the global entry program on a “case-by-case” basis, establish tough standards for visa processing times, and make critical changes to the Visa Waiver Program to update the eligibility criteria and make the program more secure.
A full summary of the senators’ proposal to help boost lagging international travel to the United States appears below.
Summary of The Jobs Originated Through Launching Travel (“JOLT”) Act
Sponsored by Senators Charles Schumer, Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, Roy Blunt, Barbara Mikulski, Marco Rubio & Mark Kirk
Expediting Priority Visitors
Currently, many spontaneous travelers do not travel to the United States because of the waiting times for visas.   Just as the State Department charges an extra fee to expedite the processing of a U.S. passport, and USCIS charges an extra fee to expedite the processing of an immigration application, so too should the State Department charge an extra fee to expedite the processing of a nonimmigrant visa.
This section requires the Secretary of State to develop “premium processing” for B-1 and B-2 visas (tourist and business travel visas).   Under premium processing, unless compelling security concerns exist, a visa will be issued within 3 business days from the date a visa is requested.
This section also authorizes the State Department to charge a fee sufficient to recover the costs of premium processing and to recover costs that will increase capacity to more quickly process B-1 and B-2 visas in India, China, and Brazil through the use of: (1) technology; and (2) creation of “mobile interview units” to process visa applications and to conduct visa interviews in cities of over 1,000,000 people with no U.S. embassy or consulate.  This will ultimately lead to faster processing of all visa applications.
Encouraging Canadian Tourism to the United States
Under current law, without a visa, Canadian citizens are not permitted to remain in the United States for longer than 180 days.  Many Canadians would remain in the United States for a longer period of time during periods when Canadian weather is still cold if they had a legal ability to do so.  In addition, Canadians who currently return to Canada after 180 days are unable to take day-trips across the border to northern-border-states in America.
This bill allows Canadians who are: (1) over age 50 (with derivative benefits to a spouse and minor children); (2) who can show that they own a residence in the United States or have purchased rental or hotel accommodations in the United States for the duration of their stay; and (3) are not otherwise inadmissible – to stay at least 240 days per year.  These Canadians are not permitted to have work authorization for this visa or access to any government benefits.   This visa will spur Canadian consumption in the United States.
Encouraging Chinese Tourism to the United States
Currently,Chinese nationals must apply for new U.S. visas every year to travel to the United States, while travelers from other countries can receive up to 10-year, multiple entry visas.  As Chinese applicants are treated differently, the State Department must dedicate significant resources to processing visa renewals, rather than facilitating legitimate travel by new visitors.
A one-year visa expiration is disruptive and expensive not only for Chinese visa applicants, but also for American businesses and universities.  If Chinese travelers want to take an annual trip to the United States, and do not live in a city where a U.S. consulate is located, they must incur hundreds or thousands of dollars in expenses (and take time off from their work or studies) to complete the mandatory face-to face interview.
This bill encourages the State Department to issue Chinese nationals longer visas than one year.
Incentives for Foreign Visitors Visiting the United States During Low Peak Seasons
One of the greatest contributing factors to high visa demand is the summer travel season. Given that visa interview wait times typically lengthen during the summer months, this bill permits the State Department to lower visa application fees during off-peak seasons to give travelers the incentive to apply for visas when demand is lower.  The overall increase in visa application volume is estimated to make up for lower per-application fees.  By increasing incentives and tiered peak and off-peak fees, the State Department can begin to spread demand across all four seasons and make visa demand more manageable overall.
Updating the Visa Waiver Program
Currently, Poland is the only member of the 25-country Schengen area not able to travel to the United States under the US Visa Waiver program .  The Visa Waiver program gives citizens of selected countries the ability to travel to the US under the ESTA program, rather than go through the more lengthy and complicated US Tourist Visa application process.  Poland has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the U.S. over the past two decades on issues that include deployment of troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, willingness to serve as a forward outpost for our missile defense shield, and being a reliable voice on behalf of the trans-Atlantic partnership in European Union councils.
This section amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the visa waiver program to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Secretary of State, to designate program countries; (2) adjust the criteria for visa refusal rates to permit entry into the program if a country has a low visa overstay rate; (3) set a maximum 3% visa overstay rate for program countries; and (4) revise probationary status and program termination provisions.  It also directs the Comptroller General to review the Secretary of Homeland Security’s methods for tracking aliens entering and exiting the United States and for detecting visa overstays.  These revisions would likely lead to Poland’s admission into the Visa Waiver Program.
Expediting Entry for Priority Visitors
The global entry program is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States. Though intended for frequent international travelers, there is no minimum number of trips necessary to qualify for the program.  Participants may enter the United States by using automated kiosks located at select airports.
At the moment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection lacks the ability to add specific foreign nationals to the global-entry prescreening system if they are not nationals of one of the “participating countries” that the United States has a reciprocal agreement with.  This creates problems for certain high-priority visitors with decision-making capacity to bring important international events—such as the Olympics, the World Cup, conventions, etc.—to the United States.
This section would permit Customs and Border Protection to add important foreign dignitaries to the global entry program on a “case-by-case” basis if they are employed by an organization that maintains a strong working relationship with the United States and do not pose security risks.
Expediting Visa Processing
This section sets standards for visa processing which says that, upon enactment, visa interviews should be conducted within 15 days of requesting an appointment. 1 year after enactment, visa interviews should be conducted within 10 days of requesting an appointment.  There are exceptions to these processing times for security reasons and for national emergencies.

Title: Hatch, Lee, Bishop Welcome Air Force Secretary to Hill Air Force Base
Date: March 26, 2012

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) today welcomed the Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Donley, to Hill Air Force Base. During the visit, the members of Utah’s congressional delegation toured the base with the Secretary and showcased Hill’s industrial, operational and training capabilities. The Delegation has long stressed that Hill is central to America’s defense, and impressed that upon the Secretary during his visit to Hill today. In addition to the delegation and top leaders at the base, the Secretary met with service members and their families as well as local leaders.
“The Secretary’s visit today was an opportunity to showcase Hill’s efficiency and its central role to our nation’s defense,” Hatch said. “The delegation has worked very well together to ensure that the hard-working men and women at Hill have the tools they need to remain one of the most efficient and effective bases in the our military. Today was a great day for northern Utah, and I look forward to continuing to work with the delegation and Secretary Donley to show why Hill is second to none and must remain a central figure in keeping America safe.”
“The time to fight for the mission of Hill Air Force Base is now,” said Lee. “If we wait until we face another round of BRAC, it may be too late to preserve the vital service the base provides to Utah and the country. I am encouraged by Secretary Donley’s visit and believe Hill AFB continues to be one of the military’s most well-run installations.”
“I appreciate Secretary Donley visiting hill AFB today,” Bishop said. “It is often a challenge to bridge the more than 2000 mile divide between Utah and Washington, D.C., which is why visits such as today’s are inherently important not only to Utah but to the future of our national defense capabilities. The visit allowed the Secretary to see first-hand the hard working men and women that support the many dynamic components of Hill AFB, which contribute to its role as one of the preeminent training, operational, and industrial military facilities in this country.”

Title: Governor Herbert, Federal Delegation, and State Legislators Join Together to Demand Transfer of Public Lands to Utah
Date: March 23, 2012

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Today, Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert signed House Bill 148, which demands the federal government make good on the promises made in the 1894 Enabling Act to extinguish title to federal lands in Utah.
The Governor was joined by U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, Congressman Rob Bishop, Utah Representatives Ken Ivory and Roger Barrus, and other stakeholders in a show of unity for the effort to return public lands to state control.
H.B. 148 creates a principle-driven framework for a structured public dialogue, a potential legal challenge, and path forward to re-balance Utah’s relationship with the federal government.
“We need a paradigm change when it comes to public lands management.  This bill creates a mechanism to put the federal government on notice that Utah must be restored to its rightful place as a co-equal partner,” said the Governor.  “The federal government retaining control of two-thirds of our landmass was never in the bargain when we became a state, and it is indefensible 116 years later.
“This is only the first step in a long process, but it is a step we must take.  Federal control of our public lands puts Utah at a distinct disadvantage, specifically with regard to education funding,” he continued.  “State and local property taxes cannot be levied on federal lands, and royalties and severance taxes are curtailed due to federal land use restrictions.  Federal control hampers our ability to adequately fund our public education system.”
“Utahns can better manage the lands in our state far better than any bureaucrat in Washington ever could,” said Senator Orrin Hatch. “As a leader in the Sagebrush Rebellion, I’ve been fighting to turn federal lands in our state over to Utahns to own and control.  I believe we are in a climate where, if we do it right, the lands in Utah can finally be under the management of our state, and I applaud the Legislature, Governor Herbert, and other parties in our state for sending this message.”
“This issue is as much about state sovereignty as it is about our state economy,” said Senator Mike Lee. “Utah can manage its priorities – like education, public safety, and health care – much more efficiently than the federal government. But the state needs resources to be effective and Washington is standing in the way.  Utahns deserve the opportunity to use the land how they see fit to improve the state economy, the education system, and our communities.”
“Signing this bill into law is a vital step in our united efforts to return the land back to the State of Utah where it rightfully belongs.  Maintaining the status quo, with the federal government owning nearly 70% of the state, will continue to hurt education funding. Children in Utah’s public school system deserve every educational opportunity afforded to those who come from states with few federal lands,” said Congressman Rob Bishop. “This was never intended to be a plight for the state and much of the West.  However, Washington bureaucrats have been stockpiling and hoarding land as part of their overzealous efforts to grow federal power.  As a result, our ability to generate funding for public education has been severely hampered. Utah has suffered long enough and it’s time that the federal government allow the state to have the opportunity to better manage and control the land within our border.  I am grateful to Governor Herbert, Lieutenant Governor Bell, and especially State Legislators Ken Ivory and Roger Barrus for their efforts to make this legislation a success.”
“A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court recently declared that congress cannot change the ‘uniquely sovereign character of a state's admission’ into the Union and that this proposition applies with even greater force where ‘virtually all of a State's public lands are at stake.’  With trillions of dollars in mineral resources and millions of acres of our lands tied up by acts of congress, what is at stake is a $2 billion education funding gap and nearly $5 billion in federal funds to Utah that are seriously at risk from a fiscally reckless federal government,” said Representative Ken Ivory. “After waiting 116 years, we simply can't wait any longer for Washington to honor to Utah the same promise it made and kept with all states east of Colorado to transfer title the public lands in a timely fashion from being admitted into the Union.”
“Utah’s children deserve equal treatment with the children of any other state.  Utah consistently ranks last in per-pupil spending.  Without access to our public lands, it would take ruinous tax increases to bring Utah to the national per-pupil average,” said Governor Herbert.  “I am leading this fight because we are reaching a point when our educational needs – which are critical to sustained economic growth – are colliding with broken federal promises and moribund federal policies.  The status quo cannot continue.  This is a fight worth fighting.”

In this video, Senator Lee discusses how Supreme Court law clerks help their respective Justices by briefing them on upcoming cases, assisting with the analysis of current cases, and writing opinions once a decision has been reached.
“Clerks provide an enormous amount of assistance to the Justices,” said Senator Lee, a former Supreme Court law clerk himself. “These relatively anonymous legal aides put hours upon hours of work into each case.

Title: Lee Pleased by Confirmation of Judge Nuffer
Date: March 22, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, after Judge David Nuffer was confirmed to be a District Judge for the District of Utah, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement:
“In recent weeks, I have made a point of objecting to President Obama’s unconstitutional ‘recess’ appointments.  On January 4, President Obama bypassed the Senate’s constitutional right to advise and consent to nominees and unilaterally made four controversial appointments at a time when the Senate was holding regular pro-forma sessions and did not consider itself to be in recess.  President Obama’s appointments are different in kind than any previous recess appointments made by any previous president.  No president—Democrat or Republican—has ever asserted the authority to determine for himself when the Senate is or is not in session.
“The President consciously chose to trample on the Constitution.  Considering himself above the law, he took for himself a power that our founding document makes clear belongs to the Senate.
"His appointments were unprecedented and clearly unconstitutional.  Having taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution, I find myself duty-bound to resist this brazen and unprecedented attack on legislative branch authority.
“Among the ways I have chosen to register my objection to these unconstitutional actions is to vote against the President’s nominees for district and circuit court judgeships.  Today I continued in taking this principled stance by voting “no” on the confirmation of Magistrate Judge David Nuffer to be a District Judge for the District of Utah.  I did so despite my unequivocal support for Judge Nuffer and my belief that he will be an excellent federal district court judge.
“I have been a strong and consistent advocate for Judge Nuffer.  I was pleased to speak on his behalf at his Judiciary Committee hearing last year and to reiterate my support when the Judiciary Committee voted to report his nomination to the Senate floor.  I remain confident in Judge Nuffer’s abilities and qualifications.
“I had the privilege of appearing before Judge Nuffer when he was a magistrate judge and I was an attorney.  I found him to be unusually well informed and well prepared, and to exercise exceptionally good judgment.  He has served the bar and the bench in Utah and beyond with distinction.  He has served as President of the Utah State Bar Association and as a member of the Utah District Court Civil Procedure Rules Committee, the Utah District Court Arbitration and Mediation Panel, and the National U.S. Court IT Advisory Committee.
“Judge Nuffer has become an expert in the use of technology by litigants and in the courts, and his extensive publications in this field and others have benefitted countless attorneys and judges.  In addition, for the last decade or so, Judge Nuffer has also served as an adjunct professor at BYU’s law school, preparing the next generation of attorneys for their work in the law.
“Judge Nuffer is well known and highly regarded throughout the State of Utah.  His knowledge, his temperament, and his experience, including 16 years as a magistrate judge, are among the qualities for which he is rightly admired.
“I am pleased that Judge Nuffer will now have the opportunity to serve Utah and the nation in this important federal district court judgeship.”

Title: Lee Releases Videos on Supreme Court, ObamaCare
Date: March 22, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the first in a series of videos giving viewers a behind-the-scenes discussion of the Supreme Court, its procedures, and the constitutional questions surrounding ObamaCare that will be before the court starting next week.
In the first video, Lee, a former Supreme Court Clerk, talks about how the court operates from the time oral arguments begin, to what each advocate can expect from the Justices, and what happens after the arguments are made and the Justices begin to debate the case.
“There is a lot of attention paid to how Congress works, but few understand all that goes into how decisions are made at the Supreme Court,” said Lee, whose father, Rex Lee, was a Solicitor General for President Ronald Reagan.  “This is where fundamental constitutional questions are decided, so it is a very important part of our system and our democracy. My hope is that through the use of video, and social media tools like Facebook and Twitter, we can build a broad dialogue about the Court, the Constitution, and the protection of our liberties.”
Lee plans to release at least two more videos discussing the ObamaCare case in depth, and well as giving viewers a closer look at the role Supreme Court clerks play in the process.

Title: Lee Introduces ‘Grow America’ Act
Date: March 19, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced the Grow America Act (S. 2199), a comprehensive bill that contains major energy production reform, tax reform, and regulatory reform. It is the counterpart to the Jobs Through Growth Act in the House.
“The size of government is perpetually expanding to the detriment of the American economy and jobs.  It’s time to stop the growth of government and start to grow America,” said Senator Lee. “Through a number of common sense solutions, the Grow America Act will make government more efficient, the economy more productive, and jobs more plentiful.  That means additional opportunities for Americans, more freedom to run their lives and businesses the way they see fit, and greater prosperity for the country as a whole.
“First, the bill will drastically streamline the tax code. The personal income tax will be reduced to just two rates, and only a select few deductions and credits that protect families, charities, and seniors will be carried over. Capital gains will also be protected from inflation before being taxed.
“Business taxes will also be simplified. Loopholes and industry-specific deductions, credits, and taxes will all be eliminated. Archaic depreciation schedules will be replaced with full expensing, and the barriers erected by the federal government between American companies and their overseas profits will finally be gone for good. Family farms and businesses will also be relieved from extreme taxation when the owner passes their assets on.
“This legislation will also impose a moratorium on new major regulations and impose the REINS Act for when they return. REINS requires every new major regulation to be passed by Congress within 90 days, or else it will ‘sunset’ and no longer be in effect. Additionally, small businesses will be able to opt out of regulations imposed since the end of 2007.
“Finally, the Grow America Act will encourage domestic energy production to power the country out of its economic stagnation and increase energy security and independence. The outer continental shelf, the Eastern Gulf, and ANWR will all be opened up for energy exploration and development, and the unnecessary delays in Gulf permitting will be eliminated.
“A one-year extension will also be provided to all outer continental shelf leases that were directly impacted and delayed by the Obama administration’s failure to move forward with the permitting process. The legislation further encourages offshore energy production by providing 50% revenue sharing to participating states.
“This administration’s ‘wild lands’ policy will be repealed, as will the EPA’s burdensome greenhouse gas regulation. The EPA will also be prevented from imposing regulations in the name of climate change. And President Obama’s tone-deaf decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline will be reversed.
“The time for action is now. The American people deserve a booming economy, a tax code they can understand, and a government that doesn’t believe regulation can solve all of the country’s problems. We need to embrace the proven methods of achieving these goals, which made America the richest and most powerful nation on Earth. The Grow America Act does just that.”

Title: Senators Introduce Medicare Reform Plan: The Congressional Health Care for Seniors Act
Date: March 15, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today in the U.S. Capitol, Sen. Rand Paul introduced his Medicare Reform Plan, the Congressional Health Care for Seniors Act (CHCSA) – S. 2196 – with co-sponsors Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Jim DeMint (R-S.C.). CHCSA will not only fix the Medicare system in its entirety, it also saves taxpayers $1 trillion in the first 10 years. This plan will provide better health care benefits, choice, quality, and outcomes by enrolling all senior citizens into the same health care plan as Members of Congress and other federal employees.
“As a doctor, I have had firsthand experience with the vast problems facing health care in the United States. Medicare, as we know it, is broken and in desperate need of reform. The CHCSA fixes the Medicare system, and gives Seniors access to the best health care plans enjoyed currently by Members of Congress and does so without breaking the bank; in fact this plan will save taxpayers $1 trillion over 10 years” Sen. Paul said. “Seniors deserve to have a world-class health care system, and Americans deserve to have their tax payer dollars put to better use, in a system that will not eventually bankrupt this country.”
“Allowing Medicare recipients to enroll in the FEHBP is a win for both seniors and the taxpayer. The FEHBP fosters competition among its hundreds of individual plans, provides better benefits for enrollees, and offers much wider choice and flexibility to participants. Most importantly, switching to the FEHBP will save the American people more than $1 trillion over the next decade. Frankly, it’s hard to argue against this common sense reform because the FEHBP covers every Member of Congress and all federal employees. Our seniors on Medicare should have the opportunity to enroll as well” Sen. Lee said.
“Our goal is to save Medicare from bankruptcy and ensure seniors have affordable, high-quality health care — a crisis President Obama has only made worse during his time in office. Allowing seniors access to the Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) program, which Members of Congress and federal employees use, will give them more choices and lower their out-of-pocket costs. It’s also good for the taxpayers because it will save the federal government $1 trillion over the next decade and reduce the unfunded liability of Medicare by $16 trillion. To get our nation’s fiscal house in order we must address future entitlement spending. Our bill gets a handle on Medicare costs, which continue to escalate, and ensures the program is sustainable for future generations” Sen. Graham said.
“This is a common-sense solution that gives seniors more control over their own health care, access to more doctors and better quality care,” Sen. DeMint said. “Doing nothing is not an option because we cannot allow Medicare to go bankrupt and for doctors to close their doors to seniors. For the first time, seniors will also have the freedom to keep private plans they like instead of being forced into a one-size-fits-all government plan. This bill improves health care for seniors, saves taxpayers trillions of dollars, and will help save our economy from unsustainable generational debt.”

Title: Lee Introduces Act to Protect Family Farms
Date: March 15, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced the Saving the Family Farm Act of 2012. The bill would eliminate the death tax on family-owned farms and other family-owned businesses that are not “C” corporations, which are those that are taxed separately from their owners. The tax would be applied if the establishment in question were to be sold off within the first five years after the death.
“We need to protect farms and other businesses that are a part of a family’s heritage when the family wants to keep and maintain them,” said Senator Lee. “Farms are of particular concern because of the land. Currently, there are many old family farms that will someday face taxes several times their entire annual operating profit, which is the family income. These families will often have no choice but to sell the land worked and maintained by their elder generations.
“The federal government should not be in the business of strangling the owners of cherished and long-held private property. This bill will fix what is broken and end the practice of bleeding certain American families dry.”

Title: Lee Applauds Reid’s Reversal on Nominations
Date: March 14, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement after the announcement that Senator Harry Reid will no longer hold cloture votes on 17 judicial nominees:
“I am pleased that Senator Reid has reversed his decision to force a series of unnecessary and contentious cloture votes on judicial nominations. The record demonstrates that claims of Republican ‘obstruction’ were simply false.  Indeed, the whole episode was merely a political maneuver designed to distract the American people from the failed Democratic legislative agenda.  I am grateful we can return our focus to the most important issue facing the country: job creation and economic growth.
“I urge Senator Reid to withdraw his recommendation that the President recess appoint additional nominees.  As Senators we have a responsibility to uphold the constitutional prerogatives of this body, including our rightful role in providing advice and consent to the President's nominations.”

Title: Lee Commends State Legislature on Recent Session
Date: March 12, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee congratulated the Utah State Legislature on a productive and bold legislative session, which concluded March 8th.  Lasting just over 6 weeks, the session encompassed important work on issues ranging from education to law enforcement, land policy to state sovereignty. Senator Lee commended the legislature for taking on tough issues and contrasted it with Washington’s inability to properly address the country’s most serious challenges.
“I want to congratulate the Utah State Legislature for its incredible courage and vision during the 45-day session,” said Sen. Lee. “In particular, their willingness to assert Utah’s rightful place in overseeing its own land should be a model for other states to follow.
“The ability of a State to oversee the land within its borders is inextricably tied to economic growth as well as critical funding for education.  The federal government – which owns nearly seven out of every 10 acres in Utah – has had far too much control, for far too long.  Growing frustration over the government’s interference in the State’s ability to responsibly access, manage and develop land, combined with an administration intent on controlling the decisions of states and citizens from Washington, led the Utah Legislature to send a strong message that they were willing to stand up for our rights.
“This session was also a good example of why States are better suited to handle the every day challenges that face its people.  While Washington attempts to fashion one-size-fits-all solutions that benefit no one, and generally do more harm than good, the States can react quickly and efficiently to the local needs of their constituents.
“I commend the Utah State Legislature for their work this year and look forward to continuing to build on our strong relationship in order to better serve the people of our State.”

Title: Hatch Act Modernization Act Introduced
Date: March 12, 2012

Content:
Washington, D.C. -- Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) and Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) introduced legislation today to modernize the Hatch Act. They were joined in the Senate by cosponsors Senators Joseph Lieberman (ID-Connecticut), Carl Levin (D-Michigan), and Mike Lee (R-Utah).
Senator Akaka said: "The Hatch Act has worked for nearly 75 years to shield employees from pressure to use federal time and resources for partisan gain, while also protecting employees' personal freedoms of choice and expression.  It is time for Congress to update the Hatch Act to provide greater flexibility for state and local government employees, and additional options for disciplining federal employees charged with minor violations of the Hatch Act."
Congressman Cummings said: "These are common-sense changes that will clarify the law and make it easier to enforce.  State and local employees, such as police officers, should not be banned from running for public office, and there should be punishments less severe than firing for minor violations.  I hope this reform will be passed swiftly by the House and Senate so the President can sign it this year."
Senator Levin said: "This legislation will allow hard-working employees of state and local government who are covered by the Hatch Act to run and serve as elected officials in their communities.  It is past time that we clarified the Hatch Act so that these highly qualified individuals can have an opportunity to run for public office."
Senator Lieberman said: "This is a common sense bill that would help expand the pool of dedicated and talented public servants running for state and local office and focus scarce resources on more serious investigations.  The bill would handle DC government employees more fairly by treating them like state and local employees."
Senator Lee said: "While federal employees must ensure that their first priority is serving the people, they are also citizens and deserve to have their freedoms protected.  If we can update the Hatch Act to provide for greater flexibility for public workers while still ensuring the legitimacy of our politics, there should be no reason for anyone to oppose such a change."
The Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012 (S. 2170) would:
Allow state and local government employees covered by the Hatch Act to run for partisan elective office; Provide the Merit Systems Protection Board - the independent federal agency that adjudicates Hatch Act complaints - with flexibility to issue a range of penalties for Hatch Act violations.  Currently, employees who violate the Act must be terminated unless the Board unanimously agrees to reduce the penalty; and Ensure that employees of the District of Columbia are subject to the same restrictions on political activity that currently apply to employees of all other state and local government agencies.
The Hatch Act, enacted in 1939 and last amended in 1993, is a federal law that restricts political activity of federal employees, as well as state, local, and District of Columbia government employees whose positions are federally funded.  It was created to ensure that federal resources are not directed for partisan political objectives and to protect civil servants from being coerced to participate in political activities.

Title: Lee Blasts Reid on Nominations ‘Stunt’
Date: March 12, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, after Senator Harry Reid announced he would file cloture on 17 judicial nominees, Senator Mike Lee released the following response:
“Senator Harry Reid’s action is nothing more than a political stunt designed to distract the American people from the Democrats’ legislative failures.  His sudden interest in judicial nominations is a desperate attempt to draw attention away from his party's failure to address our nation's economic emergencies.
“I welcome the opportunity to discuss the judicial nomination process with Senator Reid and President Obama.  Last year, my Republican colleagues and I were extremely cooperative in supporting the vast majority of President Obama's nominees, including many with whom I disagree.  We confirmed scores of district and circuit court nominees at a pace consistent with, and in some cases more quickly than, during the Bush administration.
“But on January 4, after the President made four unconstitutional appointments, we could no longer sustain the same level of cooperation.  By brazenly ignoring the Senate’s constitutional role in providing ‘advice and consent,’ President Obama made it impossible for Senators to conduct business as usual.  We simply cannot continue to afford nominees near-complete deference until President Obama rescinds his unconstitutional appointments and restores the Senate’s proper constitutional role in the confirmation process.  I cannot sit idly by and watch as the President openly violates the Constitution and ignores a century of Senate rules.
“Senator Reid's assertion that ‘Republicans have refused to allow us to even vote’ is simply false.  We have not refused a single vote.  In the time since President Obama's unconstitutional "recess" appointments, the Senate has confirmed seven judicial nominees, despite principled opposition from many Republicans.
“The notion that Senator Reid has filed for cloture because Republicans are "blocking" nominees is equally false.  In fact, of the 17 nominees in question, three were only cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, and the full Senate has not even had an opportunity to consider them.  Given such facts, Senator Reid’s claims of ‘obstruction’ simply cannot be taken seriously.
“President Obama and Senate Democrats have had three years to create, promote, and pass a pro-growth, pro-job agenda and they have failed miserably.  Such election-year stunts serve only to hide their shameful and embarrassing record.”

Title: Lee Speaks In Opposition of Antitrust Railroad Amendment
Date: March 8, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) took to the Senate floor in opposition of Senator Herb Kohl's (D-WI) railroad antitrust amendment. Lee opposes the amendment because it would add an additional layer of government oversight to an industry already burdened by extensive government regulation. A portion of the remarks are available below, and the full text can be viewed here.
"I rise in opposition to the railroad antitrust amendment offered by my distinguished colleague, Senator Kohl, and I urge my fellow Senators to do likewise.
"As the Antitrust Modernization Commission noted in 2007, “free market competition is the fundamental economic policy of the United States.”  In advancing this overarching policy goal, we should be wary of particularized exemptions from our nation’s antitrust laws.  I know that Senator Kohl shares my view in that regard.  When properly applied, antitrust laws function to help ensure that market forces promote robust competition, spur innovation, and result in the greatest benefit to consumers.
"In many respects, federal and state agencies enforce antitrust laws in order to forestall the need for burdensome and long-lasting government regulation.  If competition thrives and market forces operate properly, there is no need for extensive government intrusion or interference.  Likewise, where the antitrust laws do apply, comprehensive economic regulations should not dictate how an industry operates.
"It makes little sense to impose upon a heavily-regulated industry an additional layer of government oversight and enforcement through the application of antitrust laws, while at the same time leaving in place a comprehensive regime of government oversight through economic regulation.  Piling layer upon layer of government interference will not advance the cause of free market competition, innovation, and consumer welfare.
"I am concerned that such layering of government regulation is effectively what the Kohl amendment does.  I worry that in extending the reach of antitrust laws to the freight rail industry, the amendment does not remove any authority or jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, the regulatory agency currently overseeing the rail industry.  As a result, the amendment simply imposes additional government supervision over the rail industry with attendant increased regulatory burdens and costs, as well as inevitable conflicts and uncertainties resulting from a second layer of government oversight of the same activities.  Given the highly-regulated nature of the freight rail industry, application of antitrust laws would likely require courts to wade into the complex realm of rate-setting and other highly technical matters – a task for which judges are ill-equipped."

Title: Lee Opposes Nomination of Hurwitz to Ninth Circuit Court
Date: March 1, 2012

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) shared the following statement in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing regarding Andrew Hurwitz, President Obama's nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:
"I oppose the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz based on concerns I have with his constitutional jurisprudence.  In a 2002 New York Law School Law Review article, Mr. Hurwitz in effect took credit for helping develop the legal architecture for Roe v. Wade.  Mr. Hurwitz served as law clerk to then-Judge Jon Newman at a time that Judge Newman issued an opinion that Mr. Hurwitz asserts played an important role in developing the legal framework used to justify Roe v. Wade.  Far from deflecting credit from himself as the clerk in chambers during that time, as I believe a former clerk should, Mr. Hurwitz recounted that, in a subsequent interview for a subsequent clerkship, a Supreme Court justice had “jokingly referred” to him as “the clerk who wrote the Newman opinion.”
"Mr. Hurwitz has asserted that his law review article was descriptive and did not express his personal opinion as to the merits of Roe v. Wade, but to anyone who has reviewed Mr. Hurwitz’s article and the laudatory tone with which it discusses that Supreme Court opinion, this response is simply not credible.  Mr. Hurwitz specifically praised Judge Neuman’s “careful and meticulous analysis of the constitutional issues,” calling that analysis “striking, even in the hindsight of thirty years.”
"Mr. Hurwtiz cannot have it both ways.  He cannot seek credit for his role developing a jurisprudence that is completely unmoored from the Constitution and that has fundamentally disrespected human life, and then later claim that he was only retelling a story as an outside observer.  There is growing consensus among legal experts and scholars, both conservative and liberal, that Roe was a deficient opinion that lacks any legitimate legal reasoning in support of its holding.
"Mr. Hurwitz’s willful failure to recognize the grave deficiencies of the Roe opinion, and his self-promotion for playing a part in such an unfortunate event in this country’s judicial history, casts an unacceptable degree of doubt on his capability to serve in the role of a federal appellate judge.
"Prior to President Obama’s unconstitutional “recess” appointments, I gave his judicial nominees great deference. Both in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor, I have voted in favor of the vast majority of the President’s nominees, including many with whom I fundamentally disagree. But I can do so no more.  There is and must be a new standard for the President’s judicial nominations.  A standard under which a problematic and controversial nominee such as Mr. Hurwitz cannot receive my support."

Title: Western Caucus Examines Washington Barriers to Prosperity and Property Rights in the West
Date: February 29, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Senate Western Caucus Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY), Congressional Western Caucus Chairman Steve Pearce (R-NM), Hearing Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Members of the Senate and Congressional Western Caucuses hosted a bicameral hearing entitled “Washington Barriers to Prosperity and Property Rights in the West.”
Caucus Members and witnesses, including Idaho Governor Butch Otter and Mike and Chantell Sackett of Idaho, examined the Obama Administration’s environmental and natural resource policies and their negative impact on jobs, economic growth and private property rights in western states and communities.
Highlights from the Hearing:
“Often the voice of the West is lost among the powerful special interests that comprise the environmental lobby and their allies in this Administration.  Every day these witnesses face aggressive bureaucratic red tape and litigation that cost thousands of jobs.  The quality of life in America’s western and rural areas depends on policies that promote economic growth, not constrain it.  Principles such as protecting private property rights, supporting limited government, advocating for local control, and protecting the multiple use of our public lands, are essential to achieving that economic growth.”
U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), Senate Western Caucus Chairman
(From remarks as prepared for delivery)
"When it's a federal agency [changing the law], acting within what some refer to as our fourth branch of government or what others refer to as just part of the executive branch of government, they can just make the change of law, notwithstanding the fact that not one of them is a senator, not one of them is a representative, or the president. Not one of them has ever stood for any election. Not one of them serves in their current job subject to re-election. And as a result, your only recourse is to take them to court and to prove that what they've done is 'arbitrary and capricious' or outside their statutory authority, which is a very, very high hurdle to satisfy. I see this all over our state, I see it all over the West, this problem of lawmaking by executive fiat. There was a very good reason why our Founding Fathers, 224, almost 225 years ago, sat down and said, 'The lawmaking power is a quintessential component of what it means to be a government, and we're going to entrust that power only to those who are elected and who will stand for re-election at regular intervals.' We've got a problem with that, I'm fighting every day to try to overcome that."
U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT)
“Since Obama’s inauguration in 2009, gas prices have doubled, unemployment has increased, and our national debt has skyrocket.  Today, we heard from people across the West who feel the pain of this administration’s indifference.  Whether from an elected official focused on helping their state, county or town succeed, a fourth generation farmer trying to pass down the family farm a little better than he found it, or just a couple trying to build a home, we heard example after example of our federal government getting in the way of the American dream.  The West and the rest of our country deserves better.”
U.S. Representative Steve Pearce (R-NM), Congressional Western Caucus Chairman
“We are not here today to question the merits of protecting our environment.  We all support clean air and water and the protection of our treasured landscapes and resources.  But we must be concerned when enforcement starts becoming an end unto itself and we start ignoring the impacts that arbitrary, heavy-handed federal enforcement can have on the lives of people and their communities.”
U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Hearing Chairman
“I am proud that the Western Caucus is constantly trying to highlight the barriers to success placed in front of the West by an overreaching federal government.  Today’s hearing was enlightening, and I am very appreciative that Governor Butch Otter (ID) spent time helping my colleagues in Washington understand the unique challenges facing Western states.  It’s been my experience that resources managed by the state, by the people that live there, the people that genuinely care about the future of the land, water and wildlife where they work and raise their families, are in better health than areas under the command and control structure dictated from Washington.”
U.S. Representative Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Congressional Western Caucus Vice Chairman
“As one can see from these statistics, the federal impact on Idaho is vast.  Relying on federal land managers in Washington, D.C., to make most of the decisions about what happens on Idaho land too often leads to poor choices, mismanaged resources, local resentment and distrust.  We need more flexibility, more local control and regulations tailored to the unique characteristics of our western states.   For the economic future of Idaho and its sister states in the West, federal land managers must provide balance in the management of these lands and respect the individuality of the states and citizens their decisions impact.”
Idaho Governor Butch Otter
“The Mountain West holds some of the most beautiful and prosperous areas of our country, but it’s increasingly come under attack from bureaucrats in Washington. Whether it’s cutting off public lands to American energy production or the EPA issuing restrictive rulings, Utah and our neighbors in the West have been a target from bureaucrats thousands of miles away in Washington.”
U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT)
“It would be nice to say these are unusual stories, but those of us who represent western states hear these things every single day.  Where is the common sense?  It is absolutely gone.”
U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-ID)
“Hopefully, as we gear up to reauthorize the Farm Bill we can give the USDA the necessary tools to help producers feed a growing and troubled world rather than building barriers that limit their success.”
U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS)
“EPA issues thousands of wetlands compliance orders every year – and, like us, the landowners can’t appeal them directly to court.   So we don’t know how many of these orders are based on real environmental facts, or on superficial, shoddy, drive-by reviews, as in our case.    In our case, EPA never did any testing on our property before ordering us to stop work and walk away from our dreams.  We know this much about EPA’s wetlands compliance orders: They stop people from using their property, and that destroys jobs.   From what we can see based on our own experience, EPA must be one of America’s most efficient job-killing machines.”
Mike and Chantell Sackett—Small Business Owners from Priest Lake, Idaho
“Imposing the nonattainment designation on our rural area that is trying to stimulate growth, attract new businesses, keep old businesses and otherwise survive in this economy is simply unfair.  It appears that the EPA having been challenged and shown to be wrong, is unwilling to take any of the new wind data into account and make any adjustments to their flawed modeling.   Rather, the EPA comes across as acting like a bully, unflinching in its intention to impose its will while giving lip service to scientifically sound evidence that contradicts their view.”
Dr. Dennis Fife—Mayor of Brigham City, Utah
“As a whole, agriculture in my region has felt the weight of increasing federal regulations bearing down on our family operations.  Each one adding costs to my family operation, until one day those costs will be too high to sustain.  Environmental regulation seems to have less to do with protecting the environment and more to do with driving businesses out of the country.  It keeps our operations from doing what they need to be doing. Instead of feeding my cattle or looking after their health, I am in the office putting zeros in boxes on days we had no rain.”
Mark Knight—National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the Kansas Livestock Association
“PLF’s current caseload is heavy, because the federal government’s approach to environmental regulations is seriously out of balance.  ESA’s vague language about what constitutes a species is also a cause of regulatory mischief.  Federal regulators pick and choose whether they’ll consider the status of a species as a whole, or focus on a few specific localities, regardless of its overall health.  These are the kinds of issues that my organization deals with in the trenches, day after day: Environmental regulations that ignore the law, bend it, or push vague statutory language to the limit, imposing damaging economic costs with environmental benefits that are uncertain at best.”
Damien Schiff—Principal Attorney, Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF)
“All of these counties and towns in northern Arizona and southern Utah are directly affected by uranium exploration, mining and milling, and therefore are tremendously negatively impacted by the Department of the Interior’s recent withdrawal of 1 million acres of the country’s richest uranium resources.   Uranium which is critical for our long term nuclear power needs.  Nuclear power provides base load power.  We have plenty of fuel waiting to be used if only we could unlock the lock which the environmentalists now in charge of our government, would be made to turn the key.”
Buster Johnson—Chairman of the Mohave County Board of Supervisors, Arizona

Title: Lee Attends Hearing on Due Process Rights
Date: February 29, 2012

Content:
Today, in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee entitled, “The Due Process Guarantee Act: Banning Indefinite Detention of Americans,” Senator Mike Lee reaffirmed his support for legislation that would clarify that the U.S. government does not have the authority to detain without trial American citizens apprehended on U.S. soil.
Senator Lee is an original co-sponsor of The Due Process Guarantee Act, an important piece of legislation that would restore fundamental Constitutional rights put in jeopardy by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.
“The Constitution’s basic purpose is to protect against undue government intrusion into the lives of citizens,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  “The constitutional right to due process is fundamental to individual liberty, and we must not sacrifice this right in the pursuit of perceived greater security.  Without freedom there is no security."
The Due Process Guarantee Act, S. 2003, provides: “An authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States, unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention.”
The bill currently has twenty-three co-sponsors.

Title: LEE: Merger of Pharmacy Benefit Managers a Significant Transaction That Could Benefit Consumers
Date: February 23, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission regarding the proposed merger between Express Scripts, Inc. and Medco Health Solutions, Inc.  Lee, the Ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, noted that the merger of these two large pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) is a significant transaction that should be given careful consideration by the FTC.  Lee’s letter urged the FTC to pay close attention to the pro-competitive effects that may result from the merger.
“The merger of these PBMs may pose some risks to the market’s competitive balance but overall has the potential to create meaningful efficiencies and provide significant savings for consumers.”
“The combined entity may produce significant cost savings for health plan sponsors by means of its increased bargaining power and its improved tools for closing gaps in care, promoting adherence to medications, and overall disease management.”
“I am not aware of significant evidence that this merger will result in decreased competition among viable PBMs able to service most companies and accounts.”
Lee stated that any anticompetitive effects of the merger on community pharmacies would be of special concern, “in light of the important service those small businesses provide to rural and otherwise underserved residents in my State and throughout the country.”
Lee’s letter added that it is important to remember that the purpose of the antitrust laws is to maximize consumer welfare, not to protect competitors, and that “government regulators must be careful not to intervene in a manner that will constrain productive market forces.”

Title: Lee Responds to Sen. Reid’s Threats on “Recess” Appointments
Date: February 17, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – This afternoon Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) openly threatened Senate Republicans who are opposing presidential nominees based on President Obama's unconstitutional use of his recess appointment power.  In a speech on the Senate floor, Reid said that unless Republicans changed course, he would "recommend to the president he recess appoint all these people, every one of them."
“It is odd, to say the least, for the Senate Majority Leader to suggest that unless we stop responding to the President's unconstitutional actions, more unconstitutional actions will follow,” said Senator Lee.  “Senator Reid has condoned and encouraged further use of President Obama's unprecedented practice of making unconstitutional ‘recess’ appointments even when the Senate does not consider itself to be in recess. As Majority Leader, Senator Reid has a responsibility to defend the rightful prerogatives of the Senate against encroachment by the President. His failure has the potential to last long beyond this Administration or any partisan gains for the Democrats."

Title: Lee Delivers Remarks on Obama's Unconstitutional Appointments
Date: February 17, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding his position on President Obama's unconstitutional appointments:
"On January 4, 2012, President Obama bypassed the Senate’ s constitutional right to advise and consent to nominees and instead unilaterally made appointments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and National Labor Relations Board.  He purported to do so under the Constitution’s Recess Appointments Clause, even though at the time of the appointments the Senate was holding pro-forma sessions approximately every 72 hours.
"If allowed to stand, President Obama’s unprecedented and unconstitutional assertion of the recess appointment power could result in presidents of both parties routinely circumventing the Senate’s Advice and Consent function and thus depriving the people’s representatives of an essential constitutional check on the executive branch.  President Obama’s actions also violate the Constitution’s separation of powers.  He has asserted the unilateral power to override Congress’s own determination of when it is in session.  At an absolute minimum, the Senate’s institutional prerogatives demand that we be allowed to make our own rules, and yet President Obama’s actions would deprive our body of even that basic right.
"In the past, I have given the President’s judicial nominees great deference.  Both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor, I have voted in favor of the vast majority of President Obama’s nominees, including many which whom I fundamentally disagree.
"But I can do so no more.  The Founders expected that each branch of government would exercise the necessary constitutional means to resist encroachments by the other branches.  Among those constitutional means is the Senate’s Advice and Consent function, which I exercised today by voting against a nominee that otherwise might have received my support.  Thirty three other Senators did the same.
"The President cannot expect the Senate’s full cooperation at the same time that he does violence to this body’s constitutional prerogatives.   The threshold for confirming President Obama’s nominees must change accordingly.  Simply put, there is a new standard for confirmation.
"Both today, and in the coming days, I will join with other Senators to act as a check on the President’s unconstitutional conduct by voting against some nominees.  I expect that many of my Republican colleagues, and in time some of my Democratic colleagues, will rise in defense of the Constitution and vote against President Obama’s nominees until such time that he takes actions to restore the Senate’s full constitutional right to advise and consent to his nominees. "

Title: Lee Introduces Pain-Capable Abortion Restriction in DC
Date: February 15, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Senator Mike Lee introduced legislation that would prohibit abortions in Washington, D.C. after the 20
th
week of pregnancy, the point at which doctors say a child has developed the ability to experience pain. The “District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act” is modeled on legislation passed in Nebraska, Kansas, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Alabama. There are no current restrictions on abortions in the District.
“Protecting unborn children from experiencing pain should not be controversial,” said Senator Lee. “Similar laws have already been passed in multiple states.   With respect to the Federal District, Congress not only has the responsibility to act immediately, but also the undisputed authority to do so.
“Over the years, science has developed the ability to determine when an unborn child can experience pain. On this basis, I hope we are able to reach broad consensus where science has moved forward.  While I will continue to fight for further protection of life, there is no justifiable reason for anyone to oppose this specific level of protection.”

Title: LEE: President’s Budget ‘Irresponsible and Shameful’
Date: February 13, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to the release of President Obama’s budget outline:
“President Obama’s budget outline is irresponsible and shameful,” said Senator Lee, a lead cosponsor of the Republican-backed Balanced Budget Amendment. “It continues the policies that are making it harder for American families to get back on track. His proposal perpetuates Washington’s spending problem, deepens America’s debt, and calls for the largest tax hike in history.  The President claims ‘savings’ by using well-known budgeting gimmicks and has again denied the American people an opportunity to honestly discuss American’s fiscal future.”
According to an analysis by Republican Senate Budget Committee Staff, the President’s proposal:
Spends $47 trillion over the next 10 years;
Increases net spending over current projections by $1.5 trillion;
Increases taxes by $1.9 trillion;
Adds $11.2 trillion in new debt by 2022; and
Overstates the 10-year ‘savings’ by $3.7 trillion.
“The President has repeatedly claimed that tax increases are necessary to ensure upper-income Americans are paying their ‘fair share.’  But his budget numbers prove that it is out-of-control spending that is driving our debt, not tax rates.  Even with his tax increases, the President’s spending spree adds more than $11 trillion to our debt.”
“In stark contrast, congressional Republicans have put forward several budgets and other reforms that would deal directly and honestly with America’s economic challenges.  Legislation such as ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance,’ Lee-Hatch Balanced Budget Amendment, the ‘Budget Before Borrowing’ Act, and the ‘Honest Budget Act’ are the kinds of solutions the American people are demanding from Washington.  The President continues to stand in the way.  It is a failure of leadership, an abdication of his responsibilities, and further evidence that he is unfit to properly manage these critical issues.”

Title: Lee Opposes Nominee in Defense of the Constitution
Date: February 9, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, prior to opposing President Obama’s judicial nominee for the Southern District of California, Senator Mike Lee made the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding President Obama’s recent unconstitutional appointments:
"I rise today in opposition to this nomination. I do so not because of the qualifications of this particular nominee, but instead I do so in defense of the U.S. Constitution.
"In opposing President Obama’s appointments, I’ve repeatedly made clear that this is a constitutional issue. Each time I’ve spoken out and I’ve done so on numerous occasions, I’ve set forth in detail the reasons why I believe on a legal basis, on a constitutional basis, why President Obama’s recent purported recess appointments are unprecedented and unconstitutional.
“I’ve also made absolutely clear that my opposition to President Obama’s appointments is not partisan, and that I will hold a Republican President equally accountable whenever any republican president makes a similarly unconstitutional claim of power.
“This President has enjoyed my cooperation up to this point. I’ve voted for many if not most of his nominees. That cooperation can't continue, not in the same way that he has enjoyed it up until this point in light of the fact he has disrespected our authority, within this body. He’s disrespected the constitution.
“Unfortunately, many of my colleagues have refused to engage on the real substance of this issue. Instead, they repeatedly changed the subject to partisan politics: the nominations process and Richard Cordray's qualifications to head the CFPB.
“Even worse and despite my repeatedly making clear I intend to hold any Republican President to the same standard to protect the institutional and constitutional prerogatives of the Senate, rather than the interests of any political party, given that those are at stake, the Democrats, including the President himself, have accused me of playing politics. I want to be clear again, this is not the case.
“I’m here to defend the constitutional prerogatives of the Senate and the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances that are at the heart of our constitutional system. The Senate's advice and consent role is grounded in the constitution, the constitution system of checks and balances."

Title: Utah Congressional Delegation Pushes the Interior Department on Restrictive American Energy Policy
Date: February 8, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Utah’s Congressional delegation today wrote to Secretary Ken Salazar of the U.S. Department of the Interior to urge he overturn the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM’s) Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Oil Shale and Tar Sands that was recently announced.  The PEIS reduced the federal lands available to oil shale development from 2 million acres to only 461,965 acres. Closing off these lands is a significant missed opportunity to create jobs and lower energy costs for Utahns.
In the letter to Secretary Salazar, the delegation notes that the BLM ruling runs contrary to President Obama’s message in his recent State of the Union address where he called for an “all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.”
HATCH: “The BLM’s decision is yet another assault on American energy production and the jobs that come with it. By cutting back the original oil shale and tar sands development lands by 75 percent, the Administration has made it clear that instead of going against their liberal environmentalist allies in an election year, their willing to import more foreign sources of oil and export more American jobs. It’s another failure in leadership from this White House while energy costs and unemployment are both far too high.”
LEE: "In his State of the Union, the President said he wanted to pursue an 'all of the above' energy strategy, but apparently that doesn't include one of the country's most abundant domestic sources.  That has to set a land speed record for broken promises.  Unfortunately, it will be the American people who suffer, both in lost jobs and in higher energy prices."
MATHESON: “If the goal is to become less dependent on foreign oil, we need more domestic supply, including from untapped sources. New methodology to extract oil from shale is on the horizon in Utah. It should be allowed to compete for commercial development and BLM’s proposed leasing rules are an obstacle.”
BISHOP: “The Department of Interior’s decision to radically reduce BLM lands available for energy production in Utah and other western states illustrates this Administration’s lack of commitment to advance energy independence and jobs in the U.S.  The political unrest occurring in many of the oil producing countries, upon which we increasingly rely, could send prices skyrocketing, and it’s hard-working Americans who would be forced to shoulder the burden of rising costs.  This doesn’t have to be the case when we have abundant resources located right here in the U.S. that remain untapped, and millions of Americans out of work who would benefit from the subsequent creation of new jobs. Unfortunately, though, we have an Administration that is focused more on reelection and appealing to their special interest group supporters than doing what’s right for the future of this country.”
CHAFFETZ: “President Obama is hostile towards American energy. His decision to shut down oil shale development on public lands inhibits energy independence and economic growth.  BLM professionals conducted a three-year, stakeholder driven environmental analysis pursuant to the bipartisan Energy and Policy Act of 2005.  This apparently wasn’t good enough for the President.  His need to re-review the review is disappointing and is lacking in leadership.”

February 7, 2012
The Honorable Ken Salazar
Secretary
United States Department of the Interior
1849 C Street, N.W.
Washington, DC  20240
Dear Secretary Salazar:
We write to provide our comments on the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM’s) Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Oil Shale and Tar Sands.  Our strongly held view is that the premise of the PEIS is supported by neither the spirit nor letter of the law, that the alternatives considered by this document are deficient, and that all of the preferred alternatives run contrary to the needs of the nation and of the President’s State of the Union message calling for an “all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.”  The BLM’s stated preference for reducing the available acreage of oil shale and oil sands development by more than 75 percent causes the President’s statement to ring hollow.
Congress enacted the Oil Shale, Tar Sands, and Other Strategic Unconventional Fuels Act as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), which passed with a large bipartisan majority.  The law recognized the national strategic importance of developing domestic unconventional fuels and called for an effort by the relevant agencies of this government to “coordinate and accelerate the commercial development” of oil shale and oil sands.  That is the spirit and letter of the law.  With this announcement, the BLM is pursuing a path that is contrary to the clear intent of the law.
As required by EPAct 2005, three years of intensive studies, widespread stakeholder input, and robust public comment led to a comprehensive report by the Task Force on Strategic Unconventional Fuels and a final Oil Shale Rule in 2008 which set forth 2 million acres of land available for potential oil shale development. We fail to understand why that massive regulatory process, completed by countless government professionals, is being arbitrarily discarded by the BLM.  We also cannot discern whereby the BLM has the authority to unilaterally reverse enacted law or to break precedent by willfully failing to offer a No-Action Alternative.  Even the BLM’s early announcement that it would revisit the 2008 Oil Shale Rule to consider wilderness characteristics would have been forbidden by the Congressional funding moratorium on the Department of the Interior Secretarial Wildlands Order 3310.
It is well known that the Department of Energy has determined that U.S. oil shale resources are about three times as large as the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia.  As the world and our President must deal with an increasingly dangerous Middle East, it is unconscionable at this time to retreat from one of America’s greatest potential energy sources, especially when industry has shown the will and the means  to move forward.
As you well know, oil shale has been commercially produced and sold competitively in global oil markets for decades.  There is no lack of existing technology or data associated with that technology.  Moreover, there has already been an impressive level of investment by members of industry ready to bring current and enhanced technology to American oil shale deposits.  What is needed is a regulatory atmosphere that encourages this trend.  Sadly, it appears that your administration has taken every opportunity to send the opposite signal to this burgeoning industry.  The latest move by the BLM to restrict by more than 75 percent the acreage available to possible oil shale research and development would do harm to this industry and our nation’s energy security.
We strongly urge you to bring your department’s actions in line with the current law and the stated goals of the President Barack Obama.  Rather than retreat from this important and strategic undertaking, you should take steps to vigorously defend the 2008 Oil Shale PEIS.

Title: DeMint, Lee Bill Would End Corporate Welfare for Energy Companies in Tax Code
Date: February 2, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced the Energy Freedom & Economic Prosperity Act (EFEPA) to repeal all energy specific tax credits. The legislation is revenue neutral as it also requires a corresponding reduction in the corporate tax rate. U.S. Congressman Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) has previously introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Senator DeMint said, “Our tax code is riddled with loopholes for special interests and it’s time to end this corporate welfare that is hurting our economy. When Washington picks winners and losers in the energy market, those with the highest paid lobbyists win while the small businesses and taxpayers lose. We shouldn’t favor ethanol over hydrogen, nuclear over natural gas, or oil over renewables. The free market economy works when everyone competes on a level playing field and works to provide Americans with the best, lowest-cost products. The ultimate solution is to create a true flat tax that ends all corporate welfare, and this is a significant first step.”
Senator Lee said, "The federal government has for decades been making the mistake of picking winners and losers in the energy industry. Not only does this go against the very nature of the American economy, but it is accomplished by adding layers of costly complexity to our tax code. The waste and futility of our current energy policies are demonstrated time and time again, from the backfiring of ethanol mandates to the bankruptcies of favored companies like Solyndra to the utterly inexplicable rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. In this era of rapidly growing energy demands, we must be willing to stop government interference in the energy market and the obstruction of domestic energy production. There is no more efficient way to power the nation."
Congressman Pompeo said, “I applaud Senators DeMint and Lee for leading the charge in the Senate against President Obama’s failed policy of energy tax subsidies.   For far too long, Washington has engaged in crony capitalism by using the tax code to pick winners and losers in the marketplace.  This is all too evident in our current energy policy.  My bill, The Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act (HR 3308) is a comprehensive and thorough effort to stop this “Washington knows best” approach.  I am thrilled that Senators DeMint and Lee have taken Senate action and joined with me to end taxpayer handouts to politically favored industries. Neither our nation, nor our free market system, can afford them.”
EFEPA is supported by numerous taxpayer-watchdog groups including Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Club for Growth, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Freedom Action, Heritage Action, Less Government, National Taxpayers Union, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.
The EFEPA:
Repeals all energy tax credits.
Treats all energy sources fairly by eliminating all tax credits for renewable and conventional energy sources alike. The EFEPA does not pick winners and losers.
Requires a corresponding reduction in the corporate tax rate which keeps the legislation revenue neutral and does not take any more money out of the private economy for politicians to spend.
Assuming these tax credits are continuously extended this legislation would end nearly $90 billion in energy subsidies over the next 10 years, including credits that expired at the end of 2011.
Subsidies that will be eliminated under EFEPA include:
Enhanced oil recovery credit, credit for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, advanced nuclear power generation credit, plug-in electric and fuel cell vehicles, alternative fuel and alternative fuel mixtures, cellulosic biofuel producer credit, alternative fuel infrastructure, production tax credit for electricity produced from renewable sources, investment tax credit for equipment (solar, fuel cells, geothermal or other renewable sources of energy), clean coal investment credits.

Title: On CNN, Senator Mike Lee discusses Obama's Unconstitutional Appointments
Date: February 1, 2012

Content:
"The president has taken power that doesn't belong to him."
"This discussion is about the Constitution. It's about the fact that ours is not a government of one."
"[Americans] feel somewhat powerless because the president has taken power and exercised power that doesn't belong to him. It belongs to the people, and it's authorized to be exercised by those who are duly elected to the United States Senate."
"[President Obama] has made recess appointments at a time when the Senate was not in recess for purposes relevant to the recess appointments clause, and that is a problem."
"We don't have a government of one. We have a Senate that makes sure that presidential nominations of a certain level have to be confirmed, and [President Obama] didn't follow that process here, and I'm going to hold him accountable for that."
"We are… duty-bound to that Constitution to which we've all taken an oath, and our job is to get something done and to do it within the procedures that have been outlined in our law of laws, the U.S. Constitution. And we can't simply overlook that just because the president wants to have his way, and he wants to have his way right now. The Constitution isn't always efficient, but it is the law and we are duty-bound to uphold it. The American people deserve better than to have that overlooked."

Title: Hatch, Lee Introduce Legislation to Resolve Land Ownership for Homeowners Near Scofield Reservoir
Date: February 1, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) today introduced legislation that allows for the transfer of ownership of certain federal lands surrounding the Scofield Reservoir in Carbon County. Within the last few years it has been discovered that dozens of homes around the Reservoir are encroaching on land owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), meaning that homeowners do not own the land underneath their homes. The legislation allows the homeowners to purchase the land from the Bureau.
“This common-sense legislation ensures that the families who have owned homes around the Reservoir for generations will not have to worry that their homes will be seized and destroyed by the government,” Hatch said. “Hopefully this legislation moves quickly and we can resolve this issue once and for all.”
"This solution will ensure the affected residents of Carbon County are protected and their homes are not in jeopardy," said Sen. Lee. "With the help of Senator Hatch and Rep. Matheson, I am confident that will be the case."
The issue became a priority for Senator Hatch last year after State Rep. Patrick Painter raised the issue and the potential devastation that could be caused to the homeowners in Carbon County. U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson  is planning on introducing identical legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Title: Bipartisan Group of Senators to Introduce Legislation to Approve Keystone XL Pipeline
Date: January 30, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON –U.S. Senators John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), David Vitter (R-La.) and a total of 44 senators today announced that they will introduce legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline project under Congress’s authority enumerated in the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8. The bipartisan group of senators committed to working together to advance this critical project for the United States. Hoeven, Lugar and the other senators have been working with colleagues in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to ensure that this vital project is advanced.
The legislation authorizes TransCanada to construct and operate the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast, transporting an additional 830,000 barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries, which includes 100,000 barrels a day from the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana. The bill allows the company to move forward with construction of the pipeline in the United States while the state of Nebraska works to determine an alternative route. Hoeven secured an opinion from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) confirming Congress’s constitutional authority to approve the project.
The Keystone XL pipeline project has been under review for more than three years, but President Obama rejected it last week saying the 60-day provision authored by Lugar, Hoeven and Vitter included in the payroll tax cut extension bill passed in December didn’t give him enough time to review the project. In fact, the Obama Administration spent 1,217 days reviewing the pipeline and there was no time limit on the State Department’s ability to review the Nebraska portion of the project.
“Our legislation not only acknowledges the vital national interest this project represents on many levels, but also works in a bipartisan way to begin construction,” Senator Hoeven said. “It will create thousands of jobs, help control fuel prices at the pump and reduce our reliance on Middle East oil and it can be accomplished with congressional authority, just as the Alaska Pipeline was nearly 40 years ago. The reality is that if America doesn’t build the Keystone project the Canadian oil will still be produced and shipped, but instead of being refined in the United States by American workers and benefiting American consumers, it will be shipped by tanker across the Pacific to China.”
“The job creation, economic and energy security arguments are overwhelmingly in favor of building the pipeline. A majority of Americans support it. President Obama’s opposition is not in the best interest of the United States. The President has failed to lead but we will not stop trying to complete this critical supply line,” Senator Lugar said.
“This new bill is a lot like the old one, but it makes it definitive that Congress has the authority to push the Keystone XL Pipeline forward,” said Senator Vitter. “Everyone in Washington talks about saving the economy and creating jobs – the Keystone XL project will actually do something about that. And it would be pure politics for the president not to support it.”
“The President said recently that he was for an ‘all of the above’ approach to energy, yet he rejected the one bipartisan energy project that is shovel-ready and can produce thousands of new jobs almost immediately – the Keystone XL Pipeline,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said. “While it’s clear that the President was appealing to his liberal environmental base when he blocked Keystone, this legislation would move us towards the creation of thousands of jobs and energy security for our nation.”
Legislative Summary
The Keystone XL pipeline has been subject to rigorous environmental analysis for more than three years, and was on schedule to be decided on by the U.S. State Department by the end of 2011. By contrast, the original Keystone pipeline took two years to review and became operational last year.
The Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter legislation builds off the completed Environmental Impact Statement, which was finished by the State Department on Aug. 26, 2011. Additionally, it requires the U.S. State Department to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) within 30 days with the State of Nebraska to assist in rerouting in that state, which will be subject to the Nebraska governor’s agreement on the route within the state. However, it allows Nebraska all the time it needs to identify a new route within the state to strengthen the completed Environmental Impact Statement.
Further, the legislation requires strong environmental and safety requirements by incorporating the environmental and safety standards required and finalized by the Secretary of State. At the same time, the bill protects state and local laws relating to the protection of private property rights by ensuring those laws are not changed in this process.
In addition to Senators Hoeven, Lugar, and Vitter, other original cosponsors of the bill are Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Mike Johanns (R-Neb.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), John Thune (R-S.D.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.); Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Patrick Toomey (R-Penn.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).
What Senators Are Saying
Sen. Mike Lee:
“There is absolutely no rational justification for standing in the way of profitable enterprise that would create American jobs, American wealth, and greater American energy security. President Obama is kowtowing to the most extreme elements of the environmentalist movement by blocking the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, and he has the audacity to do so while calling Congress ‘obstructionist.’ It is time for America to reject the president’s failed economic policies and embrace proven methods of job creation, and this bill is a step in the right direction.”
Sen. Mike Johanns:
“This pipeline is not only a national priority because of the energy and jobs it will bring, it’s also a Nebraska priority. I believe we must move the project forward while still allowing Nebraska and TransCanada the time they need to find the right route through our state and this legislation does that.”
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison:
“We have spent billions in this country on ‘stimulus' packages that have not stimulated employment. With the Keystone Pipeline we have a private, non-taxpayer entity that will create thousands of jobs, bring approximately 700,000 barrels of oils sands to Texas refineries, and produce cheaper energy for families and small businesses in our country.”
Sen. Jerry Moran:
“Our country cannot afford to further delay long-term energy security, and unemployed Americans with the skills to construct this important project should not be forced to wait any longer. The Obama Administration has already spent three years reviewing the Keystone XL permit and conducting two comprehensive environmental evaluations of the project. Furthermore, the Canadian government has made it clear they will pursue other markets if this project cannot be completed. This legislation would put Americans to work now and provide an opportunity to grow local, state and national economies while taking a vital step toward energy security.”
Sen. Orrin Hatch:
“The White House’s decision to reject the Keystone pipeline project was another failure in leadership from one of the most anti-American-energy Administrations in our nation’s history. This common-sense legislation would overturn the White House’s inexplicable decision and allow this critical, job-creating project to move forward.”
Sen. Ron Johnson:
“President Obama says he wants to create jobs, invest in shovel ready infrastructure projects, and reduce America’s dependence on Middle East oil. But then he kills the Keystone XL pipeline, and the 20,000 jobs and the billions of dollars in private sector infrastructure spending that died with it. The President’s decision shows where his true loyalties lie: with extreme environmentalists. He is showing once again his dedication to increasing the federal government’s control and intrusion into our lives. I'm pleased to join as an original cosponsor of this legislation, which would allow this important project to go forward.”
Sen. Mike Crapo:
“The Keystone XL Pipeline project will create immediate jobs, stimulate the economy and generate new revenue for cash-strapped state and local governments. Further delays simply to satisfy political allies unnecessarily sacrifices real job creation for narrow interests.”
Sen. Dan Coats:
“It is both irrational and disingenuous for an administration that claims its number one priority is jobs to block a project that would put thousands of Americans back to work. We need results from Washington, not more excuses. Keystone XL pipeline has bipartisan support because it will provide jobs for hardworking Americans and reduce our country’s dependence on Middle East oil.”
Sen. Rob Portman:
“I urge President Obama to support the Keystone XL pipeline, one of the largest private sector infrastructure projects in the nation. This project would create tens of thousands of jobs, and would likely benefit Ohio’s struggling manufacturing sector.”
Sen. Saxby Chambliss:
“We simply cannot afford to delay approval of the Keystone pipeline permit any longer. Its construction will allow us to increase oil imports from Canada, a trusted ally and friend. By rejecting this permit, President Obama is putting his own re-election ahead of America’s economy and energy security. After years of review and environmental evaluation, it’s time to move forward on this project.  This legislation will ensure we do just that.”
Sen. John Cornyn:
“The Keystone XL pipeline will bring thousands of long-term jobs and energy security to the United States, and will be good for the economy, good for national security, and good for Texas.”
Sen. Lamar Alexander:
“If the president won’t act, Congress should. There’s no excuse not to move forward with a pipeline that will create 20,000 jobs and make us less reliant on oil from hostile countries.”
Sen. Pat Toomey:
“We can’t wait for the president to drag his feet on this job-creating project any longer. Instead of focusing on American energy security and putting people back to work, the president has chosen to appease environmental special interests instead. It’s time for Congress to step up and do what the president hasn’t – authorize this pipeline and create tens of thousands of American jobs, increase our access to oil from our friends in Canada, and diminish our dependence on less secure sources of energy.”
Sen. Joe Manchin:
“As our country continues to need oil, common sense tells me I’d rather buy it from our friends in Canada, not countries around the world that seek to do us harm. I’d rather buy from our closest ally and create jobs in America than push Canada to build a pipeline out to the West Coast of North America that benefits countries like China. This pipeline is a job creator with support of both labor and business. It needs to be built not for the benefit of one political party or one state, but for the benefit of America.”
Sen. Johnny Isakson:
“Now, more than ever, our country needs leadership on energy security. Unfortunately, President Obama failed to provide leadership when he rejected the Keystone XL pipeline last week. I am proud to join my Republican colleagues in the Senate in rejecting the president’s action by trying to move the Keystone XL pipeline forward. I will continue to do everything I can to support this critically important project, which will bring 700,000 barrels of crude to the U.S. from our strong ally Canada and at the same time, create thousands of American jobs.”
Sen. Dean Heller:
“Job creation should be a top priority for Congress and the Keystone XL pipeline would undoubtedly create jobs for Americans at a time when our nation needs them most.  Moreover, it would contribute to our nation’s energy security which is critical to economic growth.  It is time to put partisanship aside and start moving legislation that will help put Americans back to work.”
Sen. Bob Corker:
“The Keystone pipeline will create thousands of American jobs and provide our country with access to a large supply of North American energy.  There is no good reason to block this project when we really need the energy and the jobs the pipeline would generate.”
Sen. Jeff Sessions:
“Instead of pouring money into politically-favored companies like Solyndra, the President should have allowed the construction of the Keystone Pipeline which would have produced thousands of good-paying jobs.  This bill is a great way to create jobs without adding to the debt and will make our country stronger and more energy independent.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham:
“The Obama Administration’s decision to delay construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was irresponsible. Keystone XL will create thousands of jobs in the United States and also help reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and Venezuela. The construction and operation of Keystone XL is an economic and energy must-do for the United States. I am pleased to support this effort and am hopeful it will pass the Congress in a strong, bipartisan vote.”
Sen. Jim Risch:
“The decision by President Obama to deny the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline was flat wrong and puts politics before jobs and economic growth. That denial could very well allow the Chinese government to strike a deal and have the oil shipped to them instead of the U.S.  This legislation prevents that by clearing the way for this project to move forward.”

Title: Lee Responds to the President’s Address
Date: January 28, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to the President’s weekly address that singled out Senator Lee and criticized his vow to hold the President accountable for his unconstitutional recess appointments.
“The President’s recent recess appointments were unconstitutional. As a Senator, sworn to protect and defend the Constitution, I am duty-bound to resist the president’s actions and seek to restore our nation's proper constitutional order.
“Ironically, the President invoked our Founding Fathers in his remarks claiming they did not envision such a defense of our constitutional rights. In fact, the Founding Fathers specifically instituted a system of checks and balances designed to protect American liberties against the unrestrained power of a tyrannical Executive. The Founders worried that one branch would attempt to assert its will over the others, so they supplied each branch with tools and incentives to resist such encroachments. That is what I am exercising here.
“Sadly, the President has sought to make this a partisan issue; but the Constitution is not partisan. The Constitution does not allow any president, Republican or Democrat, to circumvent the Senate in making appointments, and I will resist, just as vigorously, members of my own party who would attempt to do the same thing.
“I ask the President to stop campaigning briefly and reread the relevant portions of the Constitution.
“Article Two, Section Two says the president ‘shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States…’ and that ‘The President shall have power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.’
“Appointments may be made if one of two conditions are satisfied: either the Senate has given its advice and consent, or when the Senate is in recess.  The Senate did not consent to these appointments; nor was it in recess.  The President cannot make appointments unilaterally and he does not have the authority unilaterally to decide whether the Senate is in recess. These appointments were therefore unconstitutional.
“From ObamaCare to the takeover of the auto industry to his unconstitutional attempt to make recess appointments, the president has consistently shown almost no regard for the constitutional limitations placed on his office.
“That is why I must take a stand. And I call on all Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents – who care about our nation, to stand with me in opposition to this blatant and egregious encroachment on our basic constitutional liberties.”

Title: Lee Introduces Budget Before Borrowing Act
Date: January 27, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced the Budget Before Borrowing Act, which would forbid the raising of the debt ceiling unless Congress has already passed a budget in the same fiscal year. The bill was introduced with 9 additional cosponsors.
“The fact that this law is necessary is a testament to the complete lack of leadership that has been demonstrated by the Democrats in their inability and unwillingness to simply pass a budget for the government that leads the free world,” said Senator Lee. “It is absolutely disgraceful that they quite literally must be forced to assume even the most basic level of financial responsibility when it comes to running the federal affairs of the largest economy in human history.
“The debt ceiling should not be raised so easily or so often in the first place, but if it is, doing so without so much as a coherent plan as to how the money raised by the new borrowing will be used is an act of national insanity. We have now gone a thousand days without such a plan. The national debt has grown by more than $4 trillion in that span of time, and the United States government lost its AAA credit rating for the first time ever as a result. This economic recklessness must stop, and it must stop now.”
“President Obama and Congressional Democrats have added trillions to our national debt and failed to pass a budget in over 1,000 days, while taxpayers and job creators are suffering under the weight of Washington’s spending binge,” said Senator Rubio. “The Budget Before Borrowing Act will send a simple message to the big spenders: no more rubber stamp to raise the federal debt ceiling without a real plan to control our spiraling debt.”
The Budget Before Borrowing Act is cosponsored by Marco Rubio (FL), David Vitter (LA), Tom Coburn (OK), Jim DeMint (SC), Mike Crapo (ID), Ron Johnson (WI), Rand Paul (KY), James Risch (ID), John Thune (SD), and Pat Toomey (PA).

Title: Lee Threatens Resistance to Nominations Until President Rescinds Unconstitutional Appointments
Date: January 26, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee formally responded to the President’s unconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  In a statement delivered at a Judiciary Committee business meeting, Lee outlined the unconstitutional nature of the appointments and criticized the justification offered by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
“President Obama used deeply flawed legal reasoning to circumvent the Constitution’s clear requirement that the Senate must be in recess in order to make such appointments,” said Sen. Lee. “The President’s assertion that he may unilaterally determine for himself whether or not the Senate is in recess violates the Constitution’s fundamental separation of government powers and the Senate's rightful prerogatives."
“Although some Senate Democrats claim prior ‘obstruction' of nominees during this Congress, in reality Senate Republicans have willingly allowed the overwhelming majority of the President’s nominations to pass through the Judiciary Committee with little controversy and receive an up or down vote on the floor."
"Given this President’s blatant and egregious disregard both for proper constitutional procedures and the Senate’s unquestioned role in such appointments, I find myself duty-bound to resist the consideration and approval of additional nominations until the President takes steps to remedy the situation.  Regardless of the precise course I choose to pursue, the President certainly will not continue to enjoy my nearly complete cooperation, unless and until he rescinds his unconstitutional recess appointments."

Title: Sen. Lee Pays Tribute to Fallen Officer Francom on Senate Floor
Date: January 24, 2012

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee spoke on the Senate floor about the tragic death of Utah policeman Jared Francom, who was shot in the line of duty on January 4th. A video of the speech is available here, and a transcript of Senator Lee’s remarks is below:
Mr. President, today I rise with a heavy heart to mourn the loss of Ogden police officer Jared Francom.
Earlier this month, on the evening of January 4th, 2012, Agent Francom was senselessly gunned down defending his fellow officers as they attempted to serve a search warrant in Ogden, Utah. Five other officers – Shawn Grogan, Kasey Burrell, Michael Rounkles, Nate Hutchinson, and Jason VanderWarf – were wounded in the gun battle.
A week later, a crowd of roughly 4000 family members, friends, and supporters, including more than a thousand uniformed officers, gathered at a public memorial for Jared to saygoodbye to one of America’s fallen heroes.
The sentiment from all that knew him was the same: Jared was a devoted family man, a dedicated father to his two young daughters, a fun loving brother and son to his family.
At the funeral, which I attended, I heard Jared’s brother Ben say he “taught people to care for each other and taught others to change the world like he was doing on the streets of Ogden.”
Commenting on the outpouring of support, Jared’s brother Travis said, “I know my brother would be proud, because we all are his family.”
Achieving a goal he’d set for himself as a young boy, Agent Francom became a member of the Ogden police force seven years ago and and was assigned to the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force.
Jared’s sacrifice should be a reminder to us of the incredible risks our brave law enforcement officers all take to protect the people they serve.  I have a deep and unwavering respect for the law enforcement community and, as a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, have seen up close how these men and women serve with honor, integrity, and dedication.
Jared Francom was no exception.  He will be remembered for giving his life in service to the people and community he loved.

Title: Lee Highlights Democrats' 1000 Days of Failure
Date: January 23, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Tomorrow, President Obama will give his State of the Union address on the 1,000
th
day since the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a budget.  In a statement today, Senator Mike Lee said this important and unfortunate milestone should not be ignored.
“The inability of the President and Democratic leadership in the Senate to produce and pass a budget for the American people in nearly three years is a stunning failure. We have gone 1000 days without a blueprint for America’s priorities, and it has led to more irresponsible spending and record-setting annual deficits.  Future generations will pay through higher taxes, greater inflation, and diminished prosperity.
“That it has happened at a time of great economic turmoil only makes the failure more dangerous. That it has happened for political reasons only makes the failure more shameful.
“During the Democrats’ 1000 days of failure, Republicans have proposed several budgets that not only reflect the will of the American people, but also a responsible path toward getting our fiscal house in order. We have submitted entitlement reform, tax reform, unprecedented spending reductions, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and even budget process reforms – all of which have been blocked by the majority.
“It should be painfully clear to the American people that the President and Senate Democrats are unworthy of leadership.  Over the span of 1000 days, they have approved of $9.4 trillion in spending and added $4.1 trillion to the national debt.  Last May, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it would be ‘foolish’ to pass a budget, and the most recent budget proposal submitted by the President was so unrealistic it failed in the Senate 97 to zero.
“Democrats will say they have failed to pass a budget because of Republican ‘obstruction’ and the threat of a filibuster in the Senate.  However, they know that budgets only require a simple majority to pass and are not subject to a filibuster.
“The truth is that they cannot publicly reveal what they would like to spend because the American people would reject it out-of-hand. Under the most recent 10-year outline by the President, interest payments on our national debt would balloon to almost $1 trillion per year, drowning out critical resources for national defense, health care, and more.  Their vision for America is unsustainable.
“As the President prepares to stand before the American people and defend the past, we should be mindful that he and his party have no concrete plan for the future.  This benchmark – the Democrats’ 1000 days of failure – is a stark reminder that we must hold them accountable immediately.”

Title: Lee Reaffirms Opposition to PROTECT IP Act
Date: January 18, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee reaffirmed his opposition to the PROTECT IP Act, flawed legislation that would unduly burden certain online businesses, threaten Internet security, and stifle innovation.
“Protection of private property rights is an essential foundation of our nation’s free market economy.  Online piracy poses a significant threat to the intellectual property rights of American innovators, and much of that threat comes from foreign websites that are currently unaccountable to the rule of law.  I am committed to making certain that these infringing pirate sites are not able to continue stealing our country’s intellectual property without consequence.
“While I am sympathetic to the basic objectives of the PROTECT IP Act, I have consistently expressed concern that several of its provisions would threaten Internet security, stifle the free flow of online information, and unduly burden third parties.  As a result, I declined to cosponsor this legislation and have worked from the beginning to make critical changes to the bill to resolve these concerns. Unless and until such revisions are made, I will continue to oppose the bill.
“Rather than rush to vote on such deeply flawed legislation, the Senate should carefully discuss and debate how best to protect American intellectual property, preserve Internet security, and promote the free exchange of ideas.  I hope and expect that Leaders Reid and McConnell will ensure that we have ample opportunity to explore the issue and attempt to resolve these concerns before the Senate holds a vote.”
Note: Last week, Senator Lee joined several fellow Judiciary Committee members in a letter calling on to Senate Majority Reid to postpose Tuesday’s scheduled vote on the Protect IP Act and allow for full discussion and debate. To view the letter, CLICK BELOW.

Title: Lee Adds Major General (Ret) Condon as Senior Policy Advisor
Date: January 17, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – TODAY, Senator Mike Lee announced the addition of Air Force Major General (Retired) Pat Condon as a senior advisor on military issues. General Condon served on active duty in the Air Force for 33 years, commanding at different times the Air Force Armament Laboratory at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering Development Center at Arnold Air Force Base, TN, and the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Utah’s own Hill AFB. He has also served in the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition in the Pentagon and as the Director of Plans and Programs in Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. Condon holds a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.
“I am incredibly honored to be able to work with a man of General Condon’s caliber,” said Senator Lee. “Not only has he devoted his life to serving his country and keeping Americans safe, he has done so with tremendous success at the highest levels. His understanding of national defense matters is exemplary.
“Going forward, I will consult with General Condon on the specific military issues that fall under the watch of the United States Senate. While the President is the commander-in-chief, Congress has a responsibility to oversee a number of decisions that affect our armed forces. These include determining the size of procurement budgets, providing proper benefits for our veterans, and authorizing base realignment and closure. With General Condon’s help, I will always be sure to make the best decisions for both the United States and Utah.”

Title: Lee Blasts Justification for Recess Appointments
Date: January 12, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee voiced concerns over the legal advice provided to the President by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding presidential recess appointment authority.
"In the memorandum released today, OLC effectively asserts that the President may unilaterally determine if and when the Senate is in recess for purposes of exercising his recess appointment power.  This remarkable and novel assertion breaks with 90 years of historical precedent. Even more disturbing, this conclusion violates the basic separation of government powers enshrined in our Constitution," said Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"The Justice Department's inadequate justification for President Obama's recent recess appointments is a shocking example of this administration's willingness to circumvent Congress and ignore the Constitution in order to achieve its controversial political agenda."

Title: Senators and Congressmen Denounce Obama Administration's decision to Ban Uranium Mining in Northern Arizona
Date: January 9, 2012

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Orrin Hatch (R-UT),  John Barrasso (R-WY) and Mike Lee (R-UT) and U.S. Congressmen Rob Bishop (UT-01), Jeff Flake (AZ-06), David Schweikert (AZ-05) and Ben Quayle (AZ-03) issued the following statement denouncing the Obama Administration’s decision announced today by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to withdraw approximately 1 million acres of federal land in northern Arizona from uranium mining:
“The Obama Administration’s ban on uranium mining is a devastating blow to job creation in northern Arizona, particularly in Mohave County,” said Senator John McCain. “This decision is fueled by an emotional public relations campaign pitting the public’s love for the Grand Canyon against a modern form of low-impact mining that occurs many miles from the Canyon walls and in no way impacts the quality of drinking water from the Colorado River. It is deeply unfortunate that certain environmental groups have chosen to break faith with a 30 year-old compromise with environmentalists that successfully balanced conservation with mining and other commercial activities. The Administration has shown that it is either careless enough to break this historic agreement or foolish enough to fall for these groups’ alarmist arguments. Either way, the Obama Administration's decision will cost Arizonans more high paying jobs under the false pretense of 'protecting' one of our national treasures, the Grand Canyon."
"Today's announcement by the Interior Department shows how much this Administration just doesn't get it,” said Senator Orrin Hatch. “Mining this land poses no environmental threat and is expected to create thousands of jobs, but the Administration continues to pander to extremist environmentalists who oppose one of the cleanest sources of energy we have. I wish I could say today's announcement comes as a surprise but sadly it's just another sign that the Obama Administration is one of the most anti-American energy presidencies in history."
“The Obama Administration must end its war on western jobs,” said Senator John Barrasso. “Secretary Salazar’s decision is irresponsible and overturns a reasonable, decades old compromise between conservationists and uranium producers.  With 8.5 percent unemployment, we need the good-paying jobs and the energy that America’s uranium producers provide.  Make no mistake, this decision is a step backwards for the unemployed and America’s energy security.”
“This administration has proven incapable of using even the slightest bit of common sense when it comes to lands policy,” said Senator Mike Lee. “The American people are desperate for jobs, and our domestic energy industry provides some of the best paying jobs in the western states. However, the President and Interior Secretary Salazar are intent on appeasing their friends in the extreme left wing of the environmentalist movement during an election year by locking up as much land as possible, regardless of the negative effects on our economy.  For energy production that has long been safe and responsible, the announcement represents a needless overreaction to a fictitious problem.”
“It is unconscionable that the Administration has yet again caved to political pressure from radical special interest groups rather than standing up for the American people.  Banning access to the most uranium rich land in the United States will be overwhelmingly detrimental to both jobs in Utah and Arizona and our nation’s domestic energy security.  While I’m disappointed that the Administration has again allowed politics to usurp sound science, I am unfortunately not surprised.  The President and his cabinet have proven they’re already on the campaign trail and right now it’s more about pandering to their political allies than doing what’s right for the American people,” said Congressman Rob Bishop, Chairman of the House Natural Resources subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands.
“Uranium mining in northern Arizona occurs well outside Grand Canyon National Park and poses no threat to the Grand Canyon or the tourism industry in northern Arizona.  This withdrawal is simply another example of the Obama Administration’s overreach that will stymie local economic growth and local job creation,” said Congressman Jeff Flake.
“I am extremely disappointed that the Obama Administration continues to do everything in its power to implement the job-killing policies of fringe environmental groups. At a time when we are desperate for jobs and economic growth, it’s clear political positioning got the best of the Administration’s decision,” said Congressman David Schweikert.
“Secretary Salazar’s announcement is yet another example of the Obama Administration putting politics above all else,” said Congressman Ben Quayle. “The Department of Interior’s own study shows that uranium mining in this part of Arizona poses little to no environmental risk.  Unfortunately, the President is more concerned with his own re-election and catering to radical environmental groups than creating hundreds of jobs in Arizona.”
The decision by Secretary Salazar disregards the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 (AWA), a compromise that permanently banned uranium exploration on over 650,000 acres outside the Grand Canyon through designated Wilderness. This historic agreement was part of a negotiated compromise with environmental groups which affirmed the compatibility of mining with conservation interests in areas not locked away by the Wilderness Act. Additionally, the Interior Department’s own environmental study on the proposed withdrawal found ‘no conclusive evidence’ that modern-day mining operations in this area are harming the Grand Canyon watershed.
Last October, U .S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Mike Lee (R-UT) and John Barrasso (R-WY) and U.S. Congressmen Trent Franks (AZ-02), Rob Bishop (UT-01), Jeff Flake (AZ-06), Paul Gosar (AZ-01), David Schweikert (AZ-05) and Ben Quayle (AZ-03) introduced the Northern Arizona Mining Continuity Act of 2011 in an effort to stop the U.S. Department of the Interior from banning mining in a vast area of Arizona, and killing jobs in the uranium mining industry.

Title: Senators Fight Back on Appointments
Date: January 6, 2012

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee joined Senators Charles Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Jon Kyle, Jeff Sessions, Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, and Tom Coburn in signing a letter addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder regarding the recent appointment of four officials to various positions in the Obama administration. Excerpts of the letter are below.
Dear Attorney General Holder:
On Wednesday, President Obama deviated from over 90 years of precedent established by the Department of Justice (Department), and the Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), by recess appointing four individuals to posts in the Administration, namely Richard Cordray as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and three members of the National Labor Relations Board, despite the fact that the Senate has not adjourned under the terms of a concurrent resolution passed by Congress.  This action was allegedly based upon legal advice provided to the President by the Office of White House Counsel.  We write today seeking information about what role, if any, the Department or OLC played in developing, formulating, or advising the White House on the decision to make these recess appointments.  Further, we want to know whether the Department has formally revised or amended past opinions issued by the Department on this matter.
In 1921, Attorney General Daugherty issued an opinion to the President regarding recess appointments and the length of recess required for the President to make an appointment under Article II Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.  The Attorney General opined that “no one, I venture to say, would for a moment contend that the Senate is not in session when an adjournment [of 2 days] is taken.  Nor do I think an adjournment for 5 or even 10 days can be said to constitute the recess intended by the Constitution.”
[1]
The reasoning of the 1921 opinion was given affirmative recognition in subsequent opinions issued by the Department, including opinions issued in 1960,
[2]
1992,
[3]
and 2001.
[4]
…
Given the Department’s historical position on this issue and the President’s unprecedented decision to unilaterally reject the years of Department precedent and Executive Branch practice, we ask that you provide responses to the following questions:
(1)
Was the Department asked to provide legal advice to the President regarding the decision to issue recess appointments of Cordray, Block, Flynn, and Griffin?  If so, was a formal opinion from the Department prepared?  If so, which office at the Department prepared the advice?  If such advice was prepared, when will it to be made public?
(2)  If a formal opinion was prepared, provide a copy of that opinion.
(3)  Attorney General Opinions, such as the one offered in 1921, are essentially the forerunner to opinions that today come from the Office of Legal Counsel, providing legal advice to the President and executive branch on questions of law.  Such OLC opinions are accorded, in the words of one former head of OLC, a “superstrong stare decisis presumption.”  Was the 1921 Attorney General Opinion withdrawn to make way for this new opinion of law that a recess appointment could be exercised when the Senate is in recess for only three days?
[1]
33 U.S. Op. Atty. Gen. 20, 25 (1921).
[2]
41 U.S. Op. Atty. Gen. 463, 468 (1960) (stating “I fully agree with the reasoning and with the conclusions reached in that opinion.”).
[3]
16 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 15, (1992) (concluding that the President could make a recess appointment during an intrasession recess from January 3, 1992, to January 21, 1992).

Title: Senator Lee: Cordray Appointment Shows Disrespect for Constitution
Date: January 5, 2012

Content:
WASHINGTON - The President’s decision yesterday to bypass the Senate and make four controversial recess appointments shows an alarming disrespect for Congress and our constitutional system of separation of powers.  Article II, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the Constitution provides that such appointments must receive the “Advice and Consent” of the Senate.  Article II, Section 2 elsewhere provides that the President may “fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate,” but Presidential practice and Senate precedent has long established that this authority does not extend to brief breaks such as the one used by the President yesterday to make his ill-advised appointments.
The Senate’s role in providing advice and consent is an important function under our constitutional system and I take very seriously my role to carefully consider the individuals nominated by the President.  Unfortunately, the President has not shown the same level of care and respect for the Constitution and the role of the Senate.  I join Leader McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others interested in upholding the separation of powers contemplated by the Constitution and call for the President to make public the legal and constitutional rationale for his hasty decision to ignore the Senate’s role in considering such nominations.

Title: Lee Sponsors Bill to Protect American Civil Liberties
Date: December 15, 2011

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee co-sponsored the Due Process Guarantee Act of 2011, which clarifies that a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force by Congress does not authorize the indefinite detention of American citizens or legal residents who are apprehended in the United States.
“The government’s most basic responsibility is to protect the civil liberties of its citizens,” said Senator Lee. “Our nation has fought wars on American soil and around the world in defense of individual liberty, and we must not sacrifice this most fundamental right in the pursuit of greater security.  Without freedom there is no security."
“Americans who commit treason, or plot treasonous acts, should and will be punished for their crimes. But granting the United States government the power to deprive its own citizens of life, liberty, or property without full due process of law goes against the very nature of our nation's constitutional values.”
The full list of original cosponsors includes: Senators Feinstein, Leahy, Lee, Udall (CO), Kirk, Gillibrand, Paul, Coons, Durbin, Nelson (NE), Shaheen, Franken, Udall (NM), McCaskill.

Title: Lee Statement on BBA Vote
Date: December 14, 2011

Content:
“Though it was no surprise that getting the requisite two-thirds vote on either amendment was a tough hill to climb, I am shocked that more than sixty percent of the Democrat caucus could not support either version.  It sends a strong signal that the majority of Democrats in the Senate do not view Congress’s out-of-control spending to be a problem, and the American public should be appalled.  Despite all the warnings from economists and experts on both sides that we are headed for a fiscal meltdown if we don’t control spending, the majority of Democrats in Congress are content to do nothing about it and choose instead to fight political battles aimed at the next election.
“The silver lining is that with 47 Republican votes for SJRes 10 and 20 Democratic votes for SJRes 24, we have a total of 67 Senators who are officially on record supporting a constitutional amendment to require the federal government to balance its budget. Americans should find some relief in the fact that Congress has the votes to pass a balanced budget amendment so long as we can find consensus on a bill.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this issue.”

Title: Lee Urges Senate to Pass Meaningful Spending Restriction
Date: December 12, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Ahead of this week’s vote in the Senate on two competing versions of a balanced budget amendment, Senator Lee urged his colleagues to support S. J. Res 10, the only version that will lead to meaningful spending restraint.
“After three straight years of record deficits, a national debt now larger than our entire economy, and losing our triple-A credit rating, Congress still hasn’t woken up to the seriousness of our situation,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Judiciary Committee. “By allowing spending to go unchecked, the opponents of a strong, structural spending restraint are threatening the future prosperity of every American.”
On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on Senator Lee’s balanced budget amendment and a version authored by Senate Democrats that allows Congress to easily circumvent any constitutional restrictions and avoid spending discipline.
Despite all the talk about spending cuts over the last year, Congress actually spent $145 billion
more
in fiscal year 2011 than it did in the previous year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Lee said this proves the need for an external, structural spending restraint like S.J. Res 10, the Hatch-Lee Balanced Budget Amendment, to get the country’s annual fiscal deficit and national debt under control.
“Every day we wait to do the right thing means making tougher and tougher choices later.  If we start the process of balancing the budget now and begin prioritizing what we spend over the next seven to ten years, we can avoid the dramatic and draconian cuts that will occur as a result of doing nothing.
“All of us know that spending is the problem.  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that keeps Congress and the President in check is the only real solution.”

Title: Lee Land Bill Clears Congress
Date: December 8, 2011

Content:
Yesterday, legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee passed both chambers of Congress for the first time. The House voted unanimously in approval of its version of a bill that authorizes the transfer of vacant and virtually unused federal land in Utah to the growing city of Mantua. The Senate version has already been passed, also unanimously.
Under the new law, Mantua will gain control of nearly 32 acres of land in Box Elder County that was originally owned by Hans Rasmussen, an early settler of Mantua. His family eventually deeded the land to the U.S. Forest Service in 1941 for $1.00. Mantua will not be required to pay for the land.

It is a testament to the success of our state and cities like Mantua that this bill was necessary,
” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “
Mantua can use the land productively and the federal government has no pressing need for it. I am glad that the House passed Congressman Rob Bishop’s version of this legislation.

Title: Lee Calls for Iran Sanctions
Date: December 2, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Last night, all 100 U.S. Senators voted in favor of S.A.1414, an amendment to S.1867, to sanction the Central Bank of Iran.  Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) cosponsored this amendment that was introduced by Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ).
Under this legislation, foreign financial institutions that conduct financial transactions with the Central Bank of Iran will be prohibited from opening or maintaining correspondent bank accounts in the United States.
This bill is a response to the illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial institutions and evade sanctions.
“The United States needs to send a clear message to the government of Iran that we will not tolerate the threats posed by the Iranian regime’s actions,” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Foreign Relations committee. “Their pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the United States, Israel, and other allies. This amendment sends a clear signal to the Iranian regime that they will not be allowed to participate in the global economic system if they continue to destabilize the region.
"I call upon the Administration to take immediate action to implement these sanctions and explain President Obama's strategy for halting Iran's charge toward obtaining nuclear weapons.  The United States cannot afford to ‘lead from behind’ on this issue."

Title: Lee cosponsors the North American Energy Security Act
Date: December 1, 2011

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee cosponsored the North American Energy Security Act, which would authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
“Not only is this an important energy project, it’s a job-creating project that is truly ‘shovel-ready,’” said Senator Lee. “Authorizing the Keystone pipeline will create 20,000 direct jobs. We can’t wait to give the private sector the freedom to put more Americans to work.
“Moreover, this pipeline will be the next step in reducing dependence on oil imported from nations that are unstable, undemocratic, and often outright hostile to the United States. It is infinitely preferable to buy more from our neighbors to the north and less from dangerous regimes. This is the sort of intelligent energy decision that we need to consistently make.”

Title: Lee Supports Detainee Protections for American Citizens
Date: November 30, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced his support for legislation that would prevent any American citizen from being held indefinitely by the military without trial.  The provision is an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is currently being considered by the U.S. Senate.
“Congress should make absolutely clear that the U.S. government does not have authority to detain an American citizen indefinitely without trial and proper constitutional process,” said Senator Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  “This amendment ensures the proper balance between individual liberty and national security, and maintains that we are both a free and a secure nation.”
Amendment #1126 to the NDAA states: “The authority described in this section for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain a person does not include the authority to detain a citizen of the United States without trial until the end of hostilities.”
Senator Lee strongly disapproves of any policy that would allow for the indefinite detention of American citizens.  Congress expects to vote on the amendment this week as a part of the NDAA package.

Title: Lee Statement on Failure of Super Committee
Date: November 21, 2011

Content:
Even after the failure of the Super Committee, Congress still has an
obligation to cut spending, balance the budget, and make the necessary
reforms to restrain its ability to do significantly greater damage to our
economy.  I still believe the principles established in the Cut, Cap, and
Balance legislation I introduced earlier this year provide the way forward for
Congress to achieve these goals, get its fiscal house in order, and regain
our triple-A credit rating.  The American people overwhelmingly support
the bill and it has already passed the House. The Senate should do the
same and the President should sign it. Playing around at the margins and
cutting a few percentage points off our national debt over the next decade
may be politically suitable, but doesn¹t fix the problem.²

Title: Senators Demand Details On Kagan’s Health Law ‘Role’
Date: November 18, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Key Senate Republicans sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Friday urging him to comply with Congressional oversight requests regarding former Solicitor General Elena Kagan’s role in the administration’s defense of the health care law. Their letter states: “when a former member of the Administration is in a position to rule on litigation in which she apparently had some involvement and which concerns legislation she herself supports, public confidence in the administration of justice is undermined. Your Department’s refusal to provide information to the Congress that could eliminate this apparent conflict of interest only undermines that confidence further.” The letter is signed by Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican Whip Jon Kyl, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Charles Grassley and Senator Mike Lee. Full text of the letter is pasted below and a PDF of the original is attached.
November 18, 2011
The Honorable Eric Holder
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530-0001
Dear Mr. Attorney General:
Members of Congress have been trying to determine whether Justice Elena Kagan has a conflict of interest with respect to participating in litigation in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) due to her involvement with and support for this legislation while a member of the Justice Department. Unfortunately, your Department has rejected all Congressional oversight requests for information about her role in the Obama Administration’s defense of this law. You recently told the Senate, incredibly, that you were not even aware of Congressional requests on this topic, and that your Department handled her duties as it relates to such matters in a way that is belied by the facts, namely that you physically removed her from all meetings discussing the litigation. Because of the highly questionable manner in which your Department is handling this important issue, we write to underscore the importance to the rule of law of an informed resolution of this question, and to apprise you of the legal and factual bases for our concerns.
Federal law requires recusal from a case if a judicial officer of the United States “has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(3). In addition, a federal judge must disqualify herself from participating in a matter if her “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  Id. at § 455(a). It appears that former Solicitor General Kagan’s participation in the Obama Administration’s defense of the PPACA may satisfy both requirements for recusal.
Then-Solicitor General Kagan acknowledged to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year that, in fact, she played a “role” in the Obama Administration’s defense of the PPACA, including attending “at least one meeting” that discussed the litigation. But she minimized her degree of involvement in the litigation, characterizing it as not “substantial.” Federal law, however, requires recusal if a government official participated in a matter that is the subject of litigation; it does not require the government official’s past participation in that same matter to be “substantial” (as determined by the self-same government official).
Moreover, emails finally produced by your Department in response to lawsuits to enforce the Freedom of Information Act suggest involvement by then-Solicitor General Kagan in the Administration’s preparations for defending the PPACA. In January 2010—two months before then-General Kagan was even aware she was being considered as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court—your Department began planning to defend this law against legal challenges. Neil Katyal, Ms. Kagan’s principal deputy, stated he would “speak with Elena” about her office participating in a Department working group that would plan the Administration’s litigation strategy, exclaiming that he wanted the Administration to “crush” those challenging the PPACA. A few hours later, Mr. Katyal indicated that he had spoken with Ms. Kagan about the legal working group, and said she “definitely” wanted her office to participate in it. (“Elena would definitely like OSG [Office of the Solicitor General] to be involved in this set of issues.”)  He said the working group would “bring Elena in as needed.” A few days later another member of your Department made clear that the working group would discuss the legal “claims that will be asserted and how [the Obama Administration] will defend against them.” This email then listed the major legal issues that likely would arise in legal challenges to the PPACA over which the working group would deliberate. (Your Department has redacted that part of the email: “The big areas of possible litigation are [redacted].”) Mr. Katyal then underscored that Ms. Kagan’s office was to be “heavily involved” in planning the Administration’s legal strategy “even in the d[istrict court].”
In March—two months before then-Solicitor General Kagan was nominated to the Supreme Court—she was party to a discussion involving the head of the PPACA litigation defense working group (Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli) and Mr. Katyal. Specifically, Mr. Katyal added Ms. Kagan to an email discussion with Mr. Perrelli so Mr. Katyal could advise her of a draft litigation complaint challenging the PPACA. Mr. Katyal raised particular parts of the complaint with Ms. Kagan and Mr. Perrelli, including his analysis of the plaintiff’s litigation strategy. He also provided a link to a website so Ms. Kagan and Mr. Perrelli could review the document themselves. Mr. Katyal then recommended to them the next steps the Justice Department should take to respond to this upcoming legal challenge. He specifically noted that he was now including then-Solicitor General Kagan to apprise her of his recommendation, presumably so she could express any disagreement with it (“I haven’t discussed this with Elena, but am cc’ing her here”). It should be noted that according to then-General Kagan’s own testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the time of this discussion of a particular legal challenge to the PPACA, she was still performing her duties as Solicitor General as normal.
Just three days later, then-Solicitor General Kagan expressed her glee to another member of your Department, Legal Advisor and Law Professor Larry Tribe, about the PPACA’s likely passage in the Congress. In an email entitled, “fingers and toes crossed today!”, Ms. Kagan happily says to Professor Tribe, “I hear they have the votes, Larry!!  Simply amazing.” Professor Tribe then gives Ms. Kagan his view of a recent modification to the legislation.  (“So health care is basically done!  Remarkable. And with the Stupak group accepting the magic of what amounts to a signing statement on steroids!”)
President Obama chose to nominate a member of his Administration to the Supreme Court knowing it was likely that, if confirmed, she would be in a position to rule on his signature domestic policy achievement—“litigation,” Mr. Katyal noted to former Solicitor General Kagan, “of singular importance” to the Administration. Among other involvement in this matter, it appears that she was privy to discussions of legal claims and litigation strategy concerning court challenges to the PPACA. And it is apparent that she herself enthusiastically supported this legislation as a member of the Administration which is now defending it. When a former member of the Administration is in a position to rule on litigation in which she apparently had some involvement and which concerns legislation she herself supports, public confidence in the administration of justice is undermined. Your Department’s refusal to provide information to the Congress that could eliminate this apparent conflict of interest only undermines that confidence further.
The Justice Department noted at the time the Congress was considering the current mandatory recusal law for federal judges that a purpose of its stricter standards was to avoid the possibility “that public confidence in the federal judicial system may be weakened.”  We urge you to reconsider your Department’s decision not to respond to Congress’s oversight requests so that the public can have confidence in the resolution of this important litigation.
Sincerely,
Republican Leader Mitch McConnell
Republican Whip Jon Kyl
Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, Senator Charles Grassley
Senator Mike Lee

Title: Republicans Announce Welfare Reform Act of 2011
Date: November 16, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) announced that he would soon introduce the Welfare Reform Act of 2011 with original cosponsors including U.S. Senators Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma), Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), and David Vitter (R-Louisiana). Companion legislation has been offered in the U.S. House by U.S. Representative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).
Over the past two decades the growth in means-tested welfare spending (292%) has outpaced the combined growth of Medicare and Social Security spending (213%) as well as the growth in education (143%) and defense spending (126%). The Welfare Reform Act of 2011 would save $2.43 trillion by 2021 by gradually reducing the costs of the 77 existing welfare programs as unemployment decreases.
Senator DeMint said: “With record levels of federal spending and record levels of Americans in poverty and using food stamps, it’s hard not to conclude that federal welfare programs are failing,” said Senator DeMint. “We don’t help Americans by making them dependent on Washington for a handout, we need more Americans empowered to stand on their own with a job in a vibrant economy. We need to reform our welfare programs to encourage self-sufficiency.  We can also save taxpayers trillions of dollars that they can use to invest in our economy to create jobs and donate to local charities that have better success at lifting Americans out of poverty.”
Senator Vitter said: “One of the most significant substantive accomplishments coming out of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress was welfare reform. But as significant as this reform was, we are overdue to renew welfare reform efforts and make additional gains because the welfare state has grown enormously since then – even factoring out recessions.”
Senator Lee said: "Failure to reform these programs puts them at risk. The spending is unsustainable and it will affect our ability to afford other national priorities. Making reasonable changes today will allow us to avoid much more painful decisions in the future."
Senator Inhofe said: “Our nation’s welfare programs are in desperate need of reform, and this measure provides a good approach.  Welfare programs are costing American taxpayers far too much while providing little benefit beyond keeping individuals and families dependent.  These reforms will empower individuals to improve their situation by encouraging and promoting greater self sufficiency.  It also holds the federal government accountable for how it spends taxpayer dollars.  I am pleased to join my colleagues in this effort to improve the situation many Americans have found themselves in during a difficult economy.”
In fiscal year 2011, total government spending on means-tested welfare spending will reach $909 billion per year. Federal spending comprises about three-quarters of this spending at $701 billion, with states contributing an additional $208 billion. This spending spans more than 70 means-tested programs for the poor including health programs like Medicaid and CHIP, housing programs, TANF, food stamps, and education programs, including HEAD Start.
The Welfare Reform Act of 2011 would:
·         Place an aggregate spending cap on all means-tested welfare spending at pre-stimulus 2007 levels (indexed for inflation) effective by 2015 or when unemployment falls below 7.5%.
·         Enforce a spending cap through the budget resolution, and saves $2.43 trillion over 10 years relative to President Obama’s Budget according to the Heritage Foundation.
·         Provide for transparency in our welfare state by requiring the President’s budget to disclose the total means-tested welfare expenditures contained in the 77 existing programs.
·         Require the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) limits the use of food stamps to essential foods, ending the use of food stamps at fast food restaurants.
·         Remove the 13.6% increase in food stamp benefits created by the President’s 2009 Stimulus law.
·         Reallocate $300 million of current welfare spending towards grants to states that successfully reduce poverty and increase self-sufficiency.
·         Prevent federal funding of abortion in any of the 77 means-tested welfare programs.

Title: Lee Statement on New Wilderness Recommendations
Date: November 14, 2011

Content:
Last week, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar recommended to Congress that three areas in Utah—Desolation Canyon, Westwater Canyon, and Mill Creek Canyon—be federally designated as “wilderness areas.” In response, Senator Mike Lee is reiterating his position on federal land use:
“Like every other state, Utah knows what is best for Utah’s land,” said Senator Lee. “I will not support any new wilderness designations unless they are first considered and approved by the Utah state legislature.
“Roughly two thirds of Utah is already owned by some part of the federal government. While any other owner would pay property taxes on this land to the state, the federal government does not, depriving Utah of an enormous source of income. In addition, Washington’s pervasive overreach also affects countless groups that want to put a small portion of land to some sort of use. Utahns must go to the federal government, hat in hand, and ask permission to merely dig a well, or to build a road, or to bury cable, or indeed to do virtually anything.
"As a result, I believe the Utah legislature must first consider and approve proposed wilderness designations before any final determination is made at the federal level."

Title: Lee Cosponsors Legislation to Reverse Rule on 'Mini-Unions'
Date: November 10, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) today introduced legislation that would reverse the National Labor Relation Board’s recent decision allowing as few as two or three employees to form micro bargaining units, or “mini-unions,” to engage in collective bargaining with employers. Isakson’s legislation, the Representation Fairness Restoration Act, has 28 cosponsors.
Isakson’s legislation comes in response to the Aug. 26, 2011, decision by the federal labor board in the “Specialty Healthcare” case, which set a new precedent allowing unions to target small numbers of employees within a company for the purpose of organizing them into micro bargaining units. For example, in one grocery store, the cashiers could form one “mini union,” the baggers could form another, the produce stockers could form yet another, and so on. This could potentially create several different unions within the same store location, making it easier for unions to gain access to employees and nearly impossible for employers to manage such fragmentation of the workforce.
Isakson’s legislation would reinstate the traditional standard for determining which employees will constitute an appropriate bargaining unit, a standard that has been developed through years of careful consideration and Congressional guidance.
“The administration’s decision to allow micro bargaining units recklessly disregards the long-standing principles of collective bargaining. This action is yet another example of how President Obama’s appointees at this agency are tipping the scales in favor of unions,” said Isakson. “This decision is adding to the pressure and uncertainty facing employers today and threatening the creation of private-sector jobs at a time when unemployment is over 9 percent.”
In March 2011, while the National Labor Relations Board was in the process of making its final decision on the “Specialty Healthcare” case, Isakson joined Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in sending a letter warning the agency that its legal reasoning could be used to apply new rules for unionization for all U.S. industries and businesses under its jurisdiction. The senators further expressed concern about the Board’s practice of trying to make labor policy through adjudication instead of the established rulemaking process.
The legislation has garnered the support of 28 original cosponsors in the Senate, including Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Daniel Coats (R-Ind.), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Michael Enzi (R-Wyo.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Johanns (R-Neb.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), John Thune (R-S.D.), and David Vitter (R-La.).

Title: Lee Introduces Bill to Repatriate Overseas Earnings
Date: November 9, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced the Rebuilding America Act, legislation that will permanently increase incentives for American companies to invest overseas earnings back in to the U.S.  economy.  Under Lee’s legislation the effective repatriation tax rate would be set at 5% down from 35%, which is currently the highest in the developed world.
“American companies have over $1.4 trillion sitting overseas because it’s too expensive to bring it back home,” said Senator Lee. “That’s money that could be used to build new infrastructure and invest in the domestic workforce.
“My legislation reduces the rate permanently, rather than granting a short-term ‘holiday,’ which lasts only a short period of time and fails to give business owners the certainty they need to make long-term investments, such as expanding their payrolls. Making the repatriation rate permanent gives American companies confidence in a stable revenue stream that they will be able to count on to fund long-term expansion.
“Most importantly, the Rebuilding America Act will free up this major new source of capital, which will help the economy grow and generate new revenue. Even a former Clinton economist estimates that corporate tax revenues would increase by $36 billion with this lower repatriation tax rate. Rather than borrowing additional billions from China, as President Obama would have us do, my plan will provide those billions to American businesses while reducing the deficit.”
Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim DeMint (R-SC), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Jim Risch (R-ID) are co-sponsoring the bill.

Title: Lee’s Land Conveyance Bills Pass Senate
Date: November 3, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON - Last night, the Senate approved legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee to authorize the transfer of vacant and virtually unused federal land in Utah to the growing cities of Mantua and Alta. The bills were approved by unanimous consent and represent the first pieces of legislation authored by Senator Lee to pass the full Senate.
Under the passed legislation, Mantua will gain control of nearly 32 acres of land in Box Elder County that was originally owned by Hans Rasmussen, an early settler of Mantua. His family eventually deeded the land to the U.S. Forest Service in 1941 for $1.00. Mantua will not be required to pay for the land.
If passed by the House and signed by President Obama, Senator Lee’s bill will allow Alta to assume control over Forest Service land that will be used for a community center and fire station.
“
It is a testament to the success of our state and cities like Mantua and Alta that these bills are necessary,
” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “
These cities can use the land productively and the federal government has no pressing need for it. I hope that the House will move quickly on Congressman Rob Bishop’s version of this legislation.

Title: Governor Herbert, Utah Congressional Delegation React to Announcement on Hill Air Force Base
Date: November 2, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Utah Governor Gary Herbert and Utah’s entire congressional delegation, including Utah Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, and Congressmen Rob Bishop, Jim Matheson and Jason Chaffetz, today expressed deep concerns with the Air Force’s decision to eliminate jobs at Hill Air Force Base.  The Governor and Utah’s delegation sent a letter today to Air Force Secretary Michael Donley detailing their disappointment with the decision. Currently, there are approximately 24,000 employees that work at Hill Air Force Base in various roles.
In the letter, the elected officials write that, the Air Force’s decisions jeopardizes “the future modernization of Hill AFB facilities and infrastructure.” They also note that “the Air Force either can’t, or won’t, provide us with the needed answers as the analytical process seems to have been circumvented.”
HERBERT : "Utah's Hill Air Force Base is unquestionably a critical component of our nation's modern defense system. This state is deeply disappointed with today's announcement, particularly given the lack of public process and absence of local input. With so much other waste in Washington, this hasty decision appears to be short-sighted and even counter-productive, jeopardizing the modernization of the country's defense. While some are saying this is a done deal, this is not over--we will exhaust every option to keep Hill as one of nation's premier defense installations and preserve valuable jobs for Utahns."
HATCH : “The Air Force’s decision ignores the basic fact that the men and women at Hill Air Force Base are among the hardest-working and most efficient workers in our armed forces. It’s simply the wrong decision as anyone who’s visited Hill well knows. I firmly believe that the command at Hill and the Ogden Air Logistics Center would be able to work with the Air Force to meet the service’s – and Utahns’ – goal of saving taxpayer dollars and maintaining the strongest military in the world. I’m going to continue to press the Air Force on maintaining the current logistics center infrastructure and do everything I can to ensure the 24,000 jobs at Hill remain in northern Utah.”
LEE: “The planned reorganization of the Air Force Materiel Command, which will significantly affect Hill Air Force Base, should be shelved immediately. The announcement came with very little coordination or communication with Utah’s representatives and many important questions remain. The Air Force has pursued this plan with an unsettling amount of secrecy and during the process failed to provide adequate details regarding personnel reductions and possible relocation sites, despite assurances that those would be made in a fair and open manner. It has failed to perform a business-case analysis, which is necessary to determine whether the reorganization will even accomplish its stated goal. I repeatedly and specifically asked the Air Force to postpone its announcement until these issues had been resolved, but it was unwilling to change its plans. As a result, I plan to fight this plan on all fronts.”
BISHOP: “In light of the fact that many questions remain unanswered and no Business Case Analysis has been conducted, I remain deeply concerned that the Air Force has chosen to proceed with the announcement of this proposal.  A BCA is an essential step that must be taken to determine whether these decisions will be beneficial or detrimental to Utah and air logistics capabilities as a whole.  This necessary analysis would provide evidence as to whether or not this would actually benefit taxpayers or end up costing more in the long run as many suspect.  The Air Force has remained elusive about the details of this plan, including their refusal to conduct a BCA.  They have been less than forthcoming about what personnel reductions may occur and where, as well as the overall impact this will have on jobs, Utah, Hill AFB and efficiency amongst all Air Logistics Centers. Subsequently, I have requested on several occasions, in writing and in person, that Air Force Secretary Michael Donley immediately halt the implementation of this plan. I want to do what is best for the Air Force and for the nation but so far the Air Force has yet to prove that this proposal is in the best
interest of the country.”
MATHESON: “There is a process in place for how these workforce decisions are made. I have concerns that in this case, the Department of Defense’s own rules and regulations were not followed. That raises questions about how appropriate the job reductions are, given the importance of Hill’s mission and the excellence and efficiency shown by Hill’s employees in our national defense.”
Hill Air Force Base is composed of two major components:  the Fighter Wings and Ogden Air Logistics Center.  Under the Air Force’s plan, Ogden’s commander will no longer be a Major General but a Brigadier General.  Ogden’s name will also be changed from an Air Logistics Center to an Air Logistics Complex.
The Governor and the delegation are concerned that the Air Force’s plan could disrupt the integrated management of Ogden’s life-cycle managers, who plan and engineer modifications to aircraft, and depot maintainers, who are responsible for performing the actual work on the aircraft.
According to the Air Force, Ogden will not lose any of its current functions and missions, and the F-22 program managers previously scheduled to move to Ogden are in fact coming.  In addition, the Secretary of the Air Force has said that Hill Air Force Base is on track to receive the first three operational squadrons of F-35s.

The Honorable Michael Donley
Secretary - United States Air Force
1670 Air Force Pentagon
Washington, DC 20330-1670
Dear Mr. Secretary:
As a united delegation of Utah elected officials, we are writing to express dismay following your meeting yesterday afternoon with selected Congressional leaders regarding your anticipated announcement which will outline a major reorganization of the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), significant downgrading of the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), and the establishment of new centralized bureaucracies in Ohio and
Oklahoma.  As things stand, we cannot support your proposal due to the lack of analysis which prohibits us from judging the efficacy of the proposed changes and the impacts on sustainment.    Sadly, the Air Force either can’t, or won’t, provide us with the needed answers as the analytical process seems to have been circumvented.
For months, our delegation’s attempts at dialogue and partnership have largely been rebuffed by you, and other Air Force leaders, even as AFMC’s reorganization plans were being drafted in haste and behind the cloak of non-disclosure agreements.   It is regrettable that you would proceed to move forward to approve and implement such a major reorganization in this effusive manner while ignoring Air Force regulations (AF165-509) which require that a formal Business Case Analysis (BCA) to be conducted on any proposed action which would result in a $500 million or greater impact across the five-year defense plan (FYDP).   Lt. General Janet Wolfenbarger admitted, in writing, that no BCA had been completed, even though the $500 million threshold is reached.  Therefore, your action appears to be in violation of Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) regulations.  Even without a regulatory mandate, principles of responsible government would dictate that a BCA be conducted to demonstrate to taxpayers that such a major reorganization creating two new three-star bureaucracies makes fiscal sense.
The secretive and subjective process used by you and the Air Force to determine the locations for the two new 3-star bureaucracies inherent in your plan is highly suspect, and offends the very notions of fairness and open government.  To have determined these locations in secret violates the precedents used previously by the Air Force in making basing decisions.
While we continue to have various other unanswered questions regarding your plan’s impact on sustainment for the war fighter, due mainly to the lack of specifics from you, one of our most significant concerns is that the plan could severely undercut the long-term viability of the Falcon Hill Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) project at Hill Air Force Base.  As you well know, the taxpayers of Utah have invested over $20 million in state funds into the Falcon Hill EUL partnership.  That investment now stands at risk through what appears to be an impetuous Air Force reorganization scheme that could reduce demand for Falcon Hill, thereby jeopardizing the future modernization of Hill AFB facilities and infrastructure.  To announce your plan, and not to have considered these potential negative impacts on Falcon Hill and Hill AFB modernization, is most disappointing and irresponsible.
Once again, we strongly urge you to defer the AFMC reorganization implementation until greater dialogue and disclosure is achieved with stakeholders, and a formal BCA is completed in compliance with Air Force and DoD regulations, including a detailed review of how the Falcon Hill EUL and Hill AFB future modernization could be negatively impacted.
Sincerely,
HATCH

Title: Lee Co-Sponsors Reform to Eliminate Budget Gimmicks
Date: November 2, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee will co-sponsor legislation that eliminates the most common budgetary gimmicks used by Congress to hide hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. In the past six years alone, the tricks addressed in the Honest Budget Act (S.1651) have enabled Congress to spend over $350 billion, money that the country simply doesn’t have.
“For too long, Washington has been using budgetary tricks and gimmicks to hide the real cost of government spending,” said Senator Lee. “The federal budget is often nothing more than a shell game: a sleight-of-hand hoax that leaves Americans wondering where the real numbers are hidden. This is not how a transparent, responsible government functions. The people deserve better.”
The Honest Budget Act will put an end to disingenuous practices such as phony rescissions, abuse of the “emergency spending” designation, and certain types of automatic pay increases, as well as require a supermajority vote to proceed to a spending bill without a budget in place.
In total, the HBA will eliminate nine different gimmicks that have been abused as part of ‘business as usual’ in Washington.
“This legislation is a significant step forward toward reforming how Washington works and putting the country on a fiscally sustainable path.”

Title: Lee: Failed Motion Shows Commitment to Big Spending Remains
Date: November 1, 2011

WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Mike Lee’s motion to maintain certain 2012 spending appropriations at 2011 levels was voted down. The motion would have affected legislation that will authorize funding for several departments, including agriculture, commerce, and transportation.
“My motion to reduce current 2012 spending by roughly $10 billion should have easily passed at a time when the country is running an annual deficit of $1.3 trillion and is saddled with a national debt as large as the entire annual output of the economy. Instead, today’s vote shows that too many members of the Senate are still committed to fighting every attempt to enact even the smallest amount of savings.
“Worse still, today’s appropriations package will achieve its increased spending levels through accounting tricks and gimmicks that allow the true numbers to be hidden from the American public.
“I will continue to do whatever I can to make the federal government smaller and more transparent.”
Before the vote, Senator Lee made the following comments on the Senate floor:
“Mr. President, I filed this motion to recommit HR 2112 with instructions to send this ‘minibus’ back to the committee on appropriations for one simple reason.: it spends more for the same set of expenditures in fiscal year 2012 than it did in 2011 to the tune of about $10 billion. I understand that there are reasons for this excess. I understand that when we look at individual components of the 2012 provision, there may be some cuts in there.
“But the overall picture, the entire pie, is about $10 billion more than what we had in FY 2011. Unless we can be open and transparent with the American people and acknowledge the fact that we are, in fact, spending more, I think this is a problem. We've got to get this fiscal house in order.”

Title: Lee Troubled By Proposed Rule Allowing Agencies to Mislead Public
Date: October 27, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee reacted to reports that the Department of Justice may be attempting to allow federal agencies to provide misinformation about the existence of certain government documents. Senator Lee cautioned that the proposed rule could be a “slippery slope” toward making government unaccountable to the people.
“Although the government has a legitimate interest in keeping certain matters of national security from becoming public, I am concerned that this proposed rule may represent a slippery slope that would ultimately limit the public's ability to hold the federal government accountable for its actions. There is already in place a process by which courts may assess whether or not documents qualify for FOIA exclusions, and I am unaware of any compelling reason to depart from that process. I will continue to investigate this matter and work with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to ensure it is properly resolved."

Title: Lee, Schumer Introduce Immigration Reform Bill
Date: October 20, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC—With an excess of supply stalling a recovery in the U.S. housing market, U.S. Senators Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) and Mike Lee (R-UT) announced today that they will offer a bipartisan proposal to boost demand for homes by luring foreign investors to purchase residences and live in the U.S. The concept is part of a broad immigration package aimed at boosting foreign travel and investment in the United States.
The Visa Improvements to Stimulate International Tourism to the United States of America Act (VISIT-USA Act) would remove bureaucratic red tape that stifles travel and investment in the U.S. For instance, the bill would reduce barriers for Canadian and Chinese visitors whose consumer spending provides a lift to the U.S. economy. The bill would also expedite priority visa applicants, introduce videoconferencing as a means to screening foreign nationals, and make major changes to visa procedures for U.S. allies in the fight against al Qaeda.
To confront the housing crisis, the legislation would provide, for the first time, a three-year residential visa for foreign nationals who invest at least $500,000 in residential real estate in the United States. At least $250,000 must be spent on a primary residence where the visa holder will reside for at least 180 days out of the year while paying taxes to the U.S.  Applicants would still be subject to standard criminal and national security background checks and, once approved, would not be able to receive government benefits such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.  The program would not serve as a path to citizenship for foreign nationals. Real estate analysts have said this proposal could lift demand for U.S. homes and help ease the housing crisis. Famed investor Warren Buffett has also supported the concept of enticing foreign homebuyers previously.
Schumer said: “This concept has the potential to lift demand for the nation’s excess homes. Our housing market will never begin a true recovery as long as our housing stock so greatly exceeds demand. This is not a cure-all, but it could be part of the solution to the housing crisis and won’t cost the government a nickel."
Lee said: “This bill supports a free market method for increasing demand for housing at a time when so many working-class Americans are underwater on their homes, are desperate for prices to rise again, and big-government programs have failed to work. I am sponsoring this bill because I know that it makes economic sense while protecting American citizens.”
The Schumer-Lee bill has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Travel Association, the American Hotel & Lodging Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee.
A breakdown of the main provisions in the VISIT-USA Act, beyond the homebuyer visa provision, appears below:
·  Encourage Chinese Nationals to Travel to the U.S:  Currently, Chinese nationals must apply for a new U.S. visa every year while travelers from other countries can receive up to 10-year multiple entry visas. The bill would allow Chinese tourists access to 5-year multiple-entry visitor visas,  in order to eliminate this significant disincentive to travel to the United States. To ensure maximum security, stop terrorism, and address fraud concerns, Chinese tourists with 5-year visas will also be required to use the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). A recent report showed that the average Chinese visitor to the U.S. spends $6,000.
·  Expedite Priority Visitors: Currently, many people of means do not travel to the United States because of the waiting times for visas. The VISIT-USA Act will allow the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service to charge an extra fee to expedite the processing of a nonimmigrant visa  just like the State Department to charges an extra fee to expedite the processing of a U.S. Passport.
·  Introduce Technology Into the U.S. Visa System: Applicants for a U.S. visa are often forced to make significant investments of time and money. The VISIT-USA Act authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct a videoconference pilot program as a method for conducting visa interviews of foreign national applicants. This would ensure that U.S. visitors spend their money inside the U.S. on our goods and not on going through red tape.
·  Encourage Canadian Tourism to the United States: Under current law, without a visa, Canadian citizens are not permitted to remain in the United States for longer than 180 days.  Many Canadians would remain in the United States for a longer period of time during periods where the weather is still cold if they had a legal ability to do so.  In addition, Canadians who currently return to Canada after 180 days are unable to take day-trips across the border to northern-border-states in America. The VISIT-USA Act creates a new “Canadian retiree visa” (non-immigrant visa) that allows Canadians who are: (1) over age 50 (with derivative benefits to a spouse and minor children); (2) who can show that they own a residence in the United States or have purchased rental or hotel accommodations in the United States for the duration of their stay; and (3) are not otherwise inadmissible – to have a visa that lasts 240 days, and is renewable every 3 years
·  Encourage U.S. Travel During Low Peak Season: One of the greatest contributing factors to high visa demand is the summer travel season. Given that visa interview wait times typically lengthen during the summer months, this bill permits the State Department to lower visa application fees during off-peak seasons to give travelers the incentive to apply for visas when demand is lower.
·  Expedite Visa for Countries Aiding the U.S. in Fight Against Al Qaeda: The Visa Waiver program gives citizens of selected countries the ability to travel to the US more easily, rather than go through the more lengthy and complicated US Tourist Visa application process, but it’s not available to all U.S. allies.  The VISIT-USA Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the visa waiver program to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Secretary of State, to designate program countries; (2) adjust the criteria for visa refusal rates to permit entry into the program if a country has a low visa overstay rate; (3) set a maximum 3% visa overstay rate for program countries; and (4) revise probationary status and program termination provisions
·  Expediting Entry for Priority Visitors:  The global entry program is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States. At the moment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection lacks the ability to add specific foreign nationals to the global-entry prescreening system if they are not nationals of one of the “participating countries” that the United States has a reciprocal agreement with.   This creates problems for certain high-priority visitors with decision-making capacity to bring important international events—such as the Olympics, the World Cup, conventions, etc.—to the United States.  This section would permit Customs and Border Protection to add important foreign dignitaries to the global entry program on a “case-by-case” basis if they are employed by an organization that maintains a strong working relationship with the United States and do not pose security risks.
The VISIT-USA Act represents the most significant reform of the U.S. immigration system in a generation, all the while adding a significant boost to our economy through increased foreign investment and tourism. Although a budget analysis of the proposal is not yet available, the senators said it was highly likely the package would significantly reduce the deficit through the increased tax revenues collected from new visa holders living in the U.S.

Title: Lee to Offer Motion to Cut Spending
Date: October 19, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee will offer a motion to keep 2012 spending levels on certain appropriations at 2011 levels.  Submitted as a motion to recommit on the “minibus” spending bill – which funds areas in agriculture, transportation, and commerce, among others – Senator Lee’s motion would save tax payers $10 billion next year.
“There’s no question this would save taxpayers just a drop in the deficit-spending bucket,” said Senator Lee.  “However, I am committed to pursuing immediate spending reductions at every opportunity.  While a lot of Senators talk about fiscal responsibility, here’s an opportunity to show they really mean it – even in a small way.”

Title: Lee Introduces the DASH Act
Date: October 13, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee introduced a bill to help dairy and ranch owners maintain the foreign workers they need to keep their businesses operating year-round, without creating a legal path to citizenship for workers. The Dairy and Sheep H2A (DASH) Act would make dairy workers, sheep herders, and goat herders eligible to apply for year-round positions through the H2A visa program.  Currently, temporary farm workers are only able to obtain seasonal visas.
“Immigration involves a complicated and difficult set of issues, particularly regarding America’s agricultural industry,” said Senator Lee.  “Few Americans are willing to work in many of these jobs, and outdated visa laws prevent business from attracting temporary foreign workers to fill the shortage.
“Making certain types of legal immigration more efficient diminishes the incentive for some to come here illegally or overstay their visas. The DASH Act streamlines the system by which we identify, process, and oversee temporary workers coming to our country to do agricultural work, thereby strengthening our economy.”
Under the legislation, visas for such workers would have an initial term of three years and could be renewed for additional periods of three years without requiring workers to return to their home countries. The DASH Act would in no way provide a legal path to citizenship and would require workers who do not obtain a proper renewal to go home.
The legislation is also sponsored by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.

Title: Senators and Congressmen Introduce the Northern Arizona Mining Continuity Act
Date: October 12, 2011

Content:
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) and U.S. Congressmen Trent Franks (AZ-02), Rob Bishop (UT-01), Jeff Flake (AZ-06), Paul Gosar (AZ-01), David Schweikert (AZ-05) and Ben Quayle (AZ-03) today introduced the Northern Arizona Mining Continuity Act of 2011. This legislation will stop the U.S. Department of the Interior from banning mining in a vast area of Arizona, and killing jobs in the uranium mining industry.
In a recent letter to Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, several members of Congress wrote in protest of the Secretary’s proposed one million acre withdrawal of mining rights.  The members stated the withdrawal has nothing to do with protecting the Grand Canyon environment but is actually ‘de facto wilderness’ for a region that conservationists previously agreed would remain accessible to the mining industry.  The Interior Department’s own environmental study on the proposed withdrawal found ‘no conclusive evidence’ that modern-day mining operations in this area are harming the Grand Canyon watershed.
The Northern Arizona Mining Continuity Act of 2011 would uphold the historic agreement embodied by the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 (AWA) that designated parts of the Arizona Strip as Wilderness and restored other lands to reasonable and safe uranium mining uses.  The letter points out that the AWA “expressly refrained from banning mining on the Arizona Strip.”
“The Department’s proposed mining withdrawal would kill hundreds of potential jobs to ‘save’ the Grand Canyon from the same form of uranium mining that conservation groups once supported,” said Senator McCain.  “It also threatens to unravel the spirit of the Arizona Wilderness Act and will raise significant questions for future Wilderness bills if agreements to accommodate responsible land uses are neither genuine nor enduring.”
"Despite the fact that uranium mining efforts have for decades operated without impacting the environment or the beauty of our national parks, President Obama is nonetheless seeking to make 326-375 million pounds of the best quality uranium in the entire country off-limits, thus putting the desires of a handful of rabid environmentalists above America's long-term energy independence and national security," said Congressman Franks.
“The Obama Administration continues to push policies that stifle American energy exploration and job creation,” Senator Hatch said. “Through Utah and the West, there’s an abundance of energy that would help fuel the economic recovery we so desperately need.  This legislation ensures that these vital public lands are accessible to domestic energy producers so we can harness the nation’s second largest domestic source of uranium ore.”
“This Department of Interior’s decision to halt mining in this region is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent congress in order to create new de-facto wilderness areas.  Blocking access to  more than a third of the known U.S. uranium deposits would have a devastating impact on job creation and would increase our reliance on foreign sources of uranium.  As it stands, we already depend on other countries for more than 90% of our uranium needs,” said Congressman Rob Bishop. “This legislation will block yet another federal land grab and help ensure that we have access to our abundant domestic energy resources, which are essential to the future of this country.”
“After having his 'wild lands' policy resoundingly rejected by Utahns and other state and local officials, Secretary Salazar appears intent upon using whatever authority he can claim to lock up lands in the western states,” said Senator Lee.  “The withdrawal of one million acres of mining rights also reneges on a compromise between the federal government and the mining industry negotiated in good faith almost thirty years ago, setting an unwelcome precedent that could have future negative consequences. This legislation will stand as yet another rebuke of the administration's relentless pursuit of federal land grabs and reinforce the message that the people, not federal bureaucrats, should be the final authority on what happens to land within their state's borders.”
“Uranium mining in northern Arizona can create jobs and stimulate the region’s economy without jeopardizing the splendor and natural beauty of the area, and that’s why Arizona’s federal, state, and local officials oppose a moratorium on such mining,” said Congressman Flake.
“It is important we focus on the facts surrounding mining in the Northern Arizona Mining district,” said Congressman Gosar.  “It is simply false and misleading to assert that if the Administration’s withdrawal is not enacted, uranium mining will take place ‘in’ the canyon or ‘in’ the park.  However without a doubt, if the Administration’s proposed withdrawal is enacted, the potential for nearly $30 billion dollars of economic growth opportunities – nearly $700 million annually and over a thousand well paying jobs – will be eliminated.  I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation, and I strongly support environmentally responsible development of our country’s vast energy and mineral resources that will expand our domestic energy supply, create new American jobs, and lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy and minerals.”
“At a time when we are desperate for jobs and economic growth, this Administration continues to do everything in its power to implement the job-killing policies of fringe environmental groups. This withdrawal is not so much a protection of the Grand Canyon, but a government land grab of economically fertile mining land,” said Congressman Schweikert.
“It is remarkable that we need legislation to force the Administration to stop such an unwarranted ban,” said Congressman Quayle.  “A study conducted by the same department that is proposing the mining withdrawal found ‘no conclusive evidence’ that modern-day mining will cause any harm to the Grand Canyon region.  Despite these findings, the Department of Interior is still pushing forward even though the ban will prevent the creation of thousands of potential Arizona jobs and economic growth for the state.  The Administration is once again putting special interests ahead of job creation.”

Title: Lee Statement on China Currency Bill
Date: October 6, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement in opposition to the China currency legislation:
“There are better, more productive ways to create jobs than to threaten a trade war with our largest trading partner. Tariffs only serve to increase costs for American businesses and consumers.  Instead, we should be looking at ways to grow the economy by reducing excessive regulation, fundamentally reforming the tax code, getting our fiscal house in order, and increasing our domestic energy supply.“

Title: Sen. Lee Submits Jobs and Economic Stimulus Legislation
Date: October 5, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee submitted legislation that would create millions of new jobs and inject $1 trillion into the American economy by significantly reducing the excessive tax on repatriated assets.  Sen. Lee’s proposal would permanently lower the tax rate for businesses from 35% to 5% on money earned overseas and brought back to this country.
“American companies want to bring their earnings back here, build out their infrastructure, and invest in their domestic workforce, but current law makes it punitive to do so.  We should be lowering those barriers and encouraging American companies to invest in this country, increase wages, and create new jobs. My bill is a common sense reform that helps businesses, workers, investors, and American industries across our economy without using mandates and regulation, or having the federal government pick winners and losers.”
Unlike recent repatriation “holidays,” which last a short period of time, Senator Lee’s bill would make the repatriation rate permanent and give American businesses the confidence they need to bring their earnings home and the stability they require to invest in jobs rather than one-time capital investments. Previous one-time “holidays,” such as the one in 2004, have been used to minimal effect because the short-term duration of the benefit does not incentivize companies to invest in long-term business infrastructure or new employment.
“The President is currently traveling the country trying to convince Americans to borrow another half-trillion dollars from the Chinese to ‘stimulate’ the economy.  My amendment would stimulate our economy by more than twice his proposal without saddling future generations with more debt. “
Studies, such as one conducted this summer by J.P. Morgan, reveal undistributed earnings from American companies’ foreign operations could be closer to $1.4 trillion, which sits on the sidelines as a result of the 35% tax rate. Research by a former Congressional Budget Office director predicted repatriation could create close to 3 million new jobs.
Senator Lee’s legislation is Amendment 691 to S. 1619, which is currently being considered by the Senate.  In the case that Majority Leader Harry Reid would prevent amendments from being added to S. 1619, Sen. Lee would offer the amendment as stand alone legislation.

Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) questioned Google CEO Eric Schmidt at a Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill. He issued the following statement at the conclusion of the hearing:
As a strong supporter of free markets, competition, and innovation, I was disappointed by the testimony of Google chairman Eric Schmidt.  I had hoped to hear the company acknowledge the responsibilities that accompany its preeminent position in the Internet search market and address concerns many have raised about Google’s possible anti-competitive activities.  Unfortunately, I fear that some of the testimony in today’s hearing may only encourage those who are calling for legal enforcement or government regulation.  I am hopeful that we can avoid those outcomes, and encourage Google to take appropriate voluntary action to resolve these concerns.

Title: Senator Lee's Google Antitrust Hearing Opening Statement
Date: September 21, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today delivered the following opening statement at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. Lee, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, called for the oversight hearing on Google to review the company's fair competition practices.
Opening Statement
Senator Mike Lee
“The Power of Google: Serving Consumers or Threatening Competition?”
September 21, 2011
Internet Gatekeeper
Internet search is critical to economic growth in the United States and Google has long been a dominant force in this arena.  Indeed, Americans “Google” so frequently and ubiquitously that the company’s name has become a generic verb that means “to search the Internet.”
In the United States, Google controls somewhere between 65 and 70 percent of general Internet search, more than 75 percent of paid search advertising, and 95 percent of mobile search.  Given its dominant position, most Internet-based businesses rely on Google for a substantial share of their traffic and revenues.  As a result, last year Google generated nearly $30 billion in search advertising revenues.
Studies show what most of us know from experience: that the first few Google search results attract nearly 90 percent of all user clicks.  Google’s search ranking therefore has enormous power over the information users find, whichwebsites receive traffic, and the amount businesses must pay to be found on the Internet.
A former Reagan administration antitrust chief recently suggested that this market power has essentially made Google a “monopoly gatekeeper to the Internet.”[1] <#_ftn1>
Whether or not Google formally qualifies as a monopoly under our antitrust laws, one thing is clear: given its significant ability to steer e-commerce and the flow of online information, Google is in a position to help determine who will succeed and who will fail on the Internet.  In the words of the head of Google’s search ranking team, Google is “the biggest kingmaker on the Earth.”[2] <#_ftn2>
General Antitrust Concerns
Google has used its substantial advertising revenues to branch out into a multitude of secondary Internet businesses.  Largely by acquiring more than 100 different companies, Google now offers YouTube video, Gmail, Chrome internet browser,Google Plus social networking, the Android mobile smartphone operating system, and a host of services including Google maps, news, books, shopping, places, and flight search.  And with its recent purchase of Motorola Mobility, Google is now poised to get into the business of mobile handset manufacturing.
With Google’s expansion into so many areas, a large number of businesses, advertisers, and consumer groups have raised concernsregarding Google’s activities, suggesting the company may be acting indeceptive and anticompetitive ways.  As a result, Google is under investigation by antitrust authorities both in the United States and abroad.
This Subcommittee has oversight of antitrust enforcement and competition policy, and I appreciate Chairman Kohl’s leadership in calling a hearing to address this important topic.
Search and Advertising Manipulation
From its inception Google’s stated goal was “to have users leave its website as quickly as possible.”[3] <#_ftn3>  But over time the company appears to have changed its approach: to steer users not to other businesses and sources of information but to its own growing complement of competing services.
Google has worked hard to cultivate the public perception that its searches are comprehensive and unbiased.  But there is growing concern that Google employs different search ranking algorithms and more attractive visual displays to advantage its own secondary sites and products, to the detriment of competing specialized search sites and other disadvantaged businesses.
There is also evidence that Google has taken information and reviews from competing specialized search sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, used that data as part of its own services, and in the processdemoted the search result rankings of the sites from which Google acquired the information.
In addition, some reports suggest that Google has taken steps to impede competing search engines from crawling, indexing, andreturning search results to its YouTube content and book scans.  Access to these popular stores of content is critical to enabling other search engines to compete.
Exclusive Dealing
There are also allegations that Google has achieved and sought to maintain its dominance in search by imposing exclusivity restrictions in dealings with advertising partners, perhaps in an effort toblock competing search tools.  This includes a broad network of exclusive search syndication deals with websites like AOL and eBay, exclusive arrangements for Google’s search box to appear on browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Safari, and agreements that Google be theexclusive default search provider on the iPhone and many Android models.
Similarly, Google’s contracts with advertisers apparently impose limits on the advertisers’ ability to transfer data associated with Google’s advertising platform to any other advertising platform using third party tools that would make the process simple or even automatic.  Studies by a Harvard Business School professor concluded that the “net effect” of these restrictions “is to reinforce the tendency of small to medium-sized advertisers to . . . use only Google AdWords to the exclusion of competing platforms.”[4] <#_ftn4>
Many observers are also concerned that Google may be seeking to prevent smartphone manufacturers and customers who wish to use its Android platform from using competitors’ services—for example, by tying Android to Google’s location program in order to exclude competing geolocation services.
Consumer Welfare
In assessing each of these concerns, the primary focus of our antitrust analysis should be consumer welfare.  Growing complaints that Google is using its search dominance to favor its own offerings at the expense of competition deserve serious attention, especially if consumers are misled by Google’s self-rankings and preferential display.  Such bias would deny user traffic and revenue to competing sites, depriving those sites of resources needed to develop more innovative content and offer better services to customers.  When competing websites lose traffic, they are forced to increase paid search advertising on Google, ultimately leading to increased prices for consumers.
As a conservative Republican who favors free markets, I believe that ensuring robust competition in this critical area of our nation’s economy will benefit consumers, spur innovation, and lead to job creation.  In this instance, I believe that preserving competitive markets through antitrust principles can help forestall the imposition of burdensome government regulation.

Title: Utah Congressional Delegation Introduces Legislation to Address Growing Threat From Prairie Dogs
Date: September 20, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Members of Utah’s Congressional Delegation today joined together to introduce legislation to address the damage being done by prairie dogs. Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, and Reps. Jim Matheson, Jason Chaffetz, and Rob Bishop joined together to introduce the Protecting Public Safety and Sacred Sites from the Utah Prairie Dog Act, which will permit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to take much-needed steps to protect Utahns from the hazards posed to public safety from prairie dogs.
Currently, the Fish and Wildlife Service is permitted to remove prairie dogs only from agricultural areas. However, the animals have done extensive damage to areas not designated as agricultural, such as the Parowan Airport’s runway and the Paragonah Cemetery in Iron County. The legislation introduced by the delegation grants the Fish and Wildlife Service the ability to remove prairie dogs from airports and cemeteries that are located within the range of the Utah Prairie Dog. The legislation is the product of cooperation between the delegation, the City of Paragonah, the City of Parowan, the Iron County Commission, the Utah Department of Wildlife Resources, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Sen. Lee: "While protecting the Paragonah cemetery and Parowan airport are important, this issue goes beyond the desecration at one burial site or the public safety hazard of one airport.  The very rules that surround the protection of certain species are outdated, unfair, and have disastrous consequences.  They have an unproportionally negative effect on the economies of states like Utah, which have large segments of federally owned land, and often violate basic property rights.  This legislation is a small, important step toward properly managing the prairie dog population in Southern Utah, but much work remains to be done on this issue."
Sen. Hatch: “Just this August, I met with Iron County officials and saw firsthand the damage prairie dogs have caused across the county. The county’s hands were tied in dealing with this problem, and this bill will ensure that the proper resources are dedicated to addressing this public safety concern. I’m pleased the delegation has been able to quickly come together and introduce this meaningful legislation to protect the safety and sanctity of sites across our state.”
Rep. Matheson: “I have heard consistent reports from Iron County officials –including during my recent visit—about their frustration over efforts to manage prairie dogs at the cemetery and the airport. Together with the other members of the Utah delegation, I am working to address Iron County’s public health and safety concerns.”
Rep. Chaffetz: “The Endangered Species Act is indefensible in this situation. Utah prairie dogs should not be elevated above the health and welfare of Utah citizens. I promise to use whatever means necessary to stop bureaucrats or environmentalist who care more about prairie dogs than people.”
Rep. Bishop: “The policies initially intended to regulate and manage the Utah Prairie Dog population have become woefully outdated and are creating a costly and dangerous situation for the state and counties.  It is unfair that Utah must shoulder the costly burden of these irrelevant policies that no longer reflect the needs of the state.  It is far too common these days that policies created by Washington bureaucrats are causing more harm than good- the issue regarding the Utah Prairie Dog is no exception.   I am glad to be a part of the delegation efforts to limit the federal government’s ability to impose and enforce policies that are not in the interest of our state.”

Title: Lee Statement on President's Upcoming Speech
Date: September 7, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee outlined several policy proposals that he would like to see the President support in his speech on Thursday night.
“The President’s agenda for the past two and half years has been a failure. From persistent unemployment to the first credit downgrade in our country’s history, President Obama’s economic policies are making Americans worse off.  For the good of the country, the President should advocate proposals that will get the federal government off the backs of the country’s job creators and incentivize investment in our economy.”
Senator Lee noted five objectives the President should support in his speech:
Structural, binding spending reforms, such as a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, that would reduce the national debt and end the practice of perpetual deficit spending
Support for sound monetary policy that will prevent further collapse of the dollar, including opposing another round of quantitative easing and additional bailouts of failing banks
Regulatory reform, including a moratorium on all new regulations until the unemployment rate reaches 7.7% (S. 1438, the Regulation Moratorium and Job Preservation Act sponsored by Sen. Ron Johnson (WI))
Reforming the tax code to make American businesses more competitive and put more money in the hands of consumers and investors
Accelerating development of America’s energy resources by reducing delays and bureaucratic hurdles
“The President has asked to speak directly to Congress on Thursday night. If he continues to push more spending, more borrowing, and more debt, it will be a wasted opportunity.  I sincerely hope that will not be the case.”

WASHINGTON – “I am disappointed in the Justice Department’s decision to seek to block the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile.  The Senate Antitrust Subcommittee received significant evidence that the transaction could benefit consumers through enhanced service quality, expanded network capacity, increased data speeds, and continued innovation of data-rich handset devices and applications.  I look forward to reviewing the Department’s analysis and trust that the merger review process will be directed towards maximization of consumer welfare.”

Title: U.S. Senator Mike Lee Responds to S&P Downgrade of United States
Date: August 5, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Lee responded to S&P lowering the long held AAA rating for the United States saying, “This downgrade confirms what we have known was coming, but have chosen to ignore, for a long time.  This downgrade further confirms that the true threat to our country, our economy and our way of life is our debt and the continued deficit spending Washington and the current administration are pursuing.”
For the first time ever the United States does not hold a AAA rating.  The impact could be felt in numerous ways including higher interests rates for car, home or student loans along with credit card rates.  Lee then stated, “Unfortunately, when it comes to the significant financial challenges this country faces, we have been swatting at the branches and symptoms instead of attacking the root and core causes. Never has there been a greater need for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution – to ensure we get our fiscal house in order, reduce our debt, and get Washington to live within its means.”
Calling on his colleagues in the House and Senate along with the Administration and Americans across the country Lee said, “The answer to our economic challenges lies within a simple concept most Americans and most states understand and live by – balance your checkbook and don’t spend more than you bring in.  This is not a liberal or conservative issue, it isn’t a Democrat or Republican issue – it is an American issue.  If ever there were a time for Americans and members of Congress to have an open debate and dialogue about the future of our country, that time is now.  I invite everyone to begin to understand where we are as a nation and what it will take to restore both our AAA rating, and more importantly, our strength and greatness as a country.”

Title: Heller, Lee , Four Senators Demand Transparency from Joint Committee
Date: August 4, 2011

Content:
(Washington, DC)
–Today, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) and a group of five Republican Senators wrote a letter to Senate leadership asking that all meetings of the new joint congressional committee created by the Budget Control Act be open to the public and available for television broadcast. The Senators also expressed concern about the closed-door nature of the joint committee meetings.
Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), John Boozman (R-AR), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Lee (R-UT), and David Vitter (R-LA) co-signed the letter.
“The American people have a right to know what their government is going to do with their tax dollars. Not only do closed door meetings by this Committee prevent the public from knowing how their dollars are being spent, but these meetings also have the potential to promote deals with special interests. Open door proceedings will allow the public to be their own advocates, rather than relying on games of inside baseball that too often dominate today’s Washington,” said Senator Heller.
All of the letter’s co-signers are also original co-sponsors of the Budget Control Joint Committee Transparency Act (S.1501), legislation Senator Heller introduced in the Senate yesterday. This bill mandates that proceedings of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction be transparent and open to the public.
Full text of the letter below

August 3, 2011
The Honorable Harry Reid                                         The Honorable Mitch McConnell
Democratic Leader                                                      Republican Leader
United States Senate                                                   United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510                                              Washington, DC 20510
Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell:
The Budget Control Act (S.637) signed into law on August 2, 2011, creates a new joint congressional committee entrusted with recommending and ultimately crafting legislation to reduce our deficit by at least $1.2 trillion.  We support addressing our national debt and warding off what has been called the “most predictable economic crisis” in our nation’s history.  However, we are united in our concern about the authority granted to this committee.
As we understand it, this Committee essentially has the ability to craft their list of recommendations without any joint committee jurisdictions and without an open committee process.  Furthermore, these recommendations are not subject to debate or an amendment process afforded the majority of legislation considered in the Senate.
We remain concerned that all aspects of the federal budget, including revenue increases, could be subject to the Committee’s recommendations.  If our colleagues wish to raise taxes or propose spending cuts, the American people have a right to see that process unfold.
We ask you, as two of the appointers of the Committee, to ensure that all meetings and hearings are done in a transparent manner through advanced public notification, public attendance and live television broadcasts.  Meetings will include any time a quorum of members are present to discuss committee related matters whether it be in person, over the phone or via teleconference.
All Americans should have the ability to see how the Committee crafts a concrete plan for our fiscal future.  As original cosponsors of the Budget Control Joint Committee Transparency Act (S.1501), we stand firm in our belief that the public should understand how their tax dollars are being spent, which requires an open process rather than a series of closed-door meetings.
We recognize the very serious dangers posed by our nation’s debt and share your commitment to addressing it.  As you begin to craft the Committee, we ask that you allow this process to unfold before the American people through an open debate.  We remain committed to this issue and hope that it will be resolved prior to consideration of S. 1501.
In order to meet our nation’s financial obligations, this body must meet its obligation to the American people to do the work we were sent here to do.  We look forward to your response to this request.
Sincerely,
U.S. Senator Dean Heller
U.S. Senator David Vitter
U.S. Senator Mike Lee
U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte
U.S. Senator John Boozman

Title: Budget Control Act is a 'Disappointing Failure'
Date: August 2, 2011

Content:
“The Budget Control Act represents a disappointing failure on the part of this Congress.  We have squandered the best opportunity we had to fundamentally reform the way Washington spends money and put the nation on a sustainable path toward a balanced budget.  Instead, this bill increases our national debt by more than $2 trillion and cuts spending by only $7 billion over the same time period.  There is no reliable enforcement mechanism for future spending reductions.  We only have the hollow promises from a Congress that created the mess in the first place.  The Act contains neither a balanced budget amendment nor any other structural spending reform to end the federal government’s fiscal irresponsibility.  Worse, it creates a ‘Super Congress’ with the power to submit legislation that cannot be amended and could raise taxes on the American people.  This is not at all what we were elected to do.”

Title: Debt Proposals are "Typical Washington Answers"
Date: July 25, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement on the debt proposals released by Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Harry Reid:
“Both plans represent typical Washington answers to the federal government’s out-of-control spending problem.  They add trillions to the national debt in the short-term while making hollow promises to cut spending in the long-term.  Neither of the proposals fundamentally reform the way Washington spends money, require the federal government to balance its budget, or protect our triple-A credit rating.
“The right solution is immediate cuts, enforceable spending caps, and structural reform, including a balanced budget amendment, not empty promises,  unaccountable commissions, and business as usual.
“Republicans have already put forward a plan that grants the President’s unprecedented request on the debt ceiling.  The House passed it and every Republican in the Senate voted for it.  If we reach August 2 without a meaningful deal, it will be because the President and Senate Democrats refused to take Washington’s spending problem seriously.”

WASHINGTON – Following a procedural vote to prevent the “Cut, Cap, and Balance Act” from coming to the Senate floor, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement:
“Today, Majority Leader Harry Reid used procedural tactic to prevent a vote on a bill that is supported by two-thirds of the country.  It is shameful, despicable, and an abuse of this chamber.  We weren’t even allowed sufficient time to debate the one bill in Congress that would address the country’s most immediate challenges.
“The Democrats have blocked a vote for now, but the fight is not over.  I will continue to make sure ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance’ receives a proper up or down vote in the Senate.”

Title: Poll Shows 66% of Americans Support Cut, Cap, Balance
Date: July 21, 2011

Content:
Today, Senator Mike Lee highlighted a new CNN poll that shows two-thirds of the American people support the “cut, cap, and balance” approach to solving the nation’s debt crisis.
Using language that closely mimics Senator Lee’s “Cut, Cap, and Balance Act”, respondents were asked whether they favored or opposed only raising the debt ceiling if Congress first passed a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and substantial spending cuts and caps on future spending were approved. A full 66% said they were in favor.
Additionally, the poll shows three out of four Americans (74%) favor a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget.
Senator Lee reacted to the poll results: “The survey backs up what we have been saying all along: the American people are with us.  They want Congress to cut spending and balance the budget.  We have a plan to do that called “Cut, Cap, and Balance.” The responsibility is now on The President and Senate Democrats to follow the will of the American people and pass this legislation.”
The poll included interviews with 1,009 adult Americans conducted by telephone on July 18-20, 2011

“Senate Democrats should stop wasting time we don’t have fiddling with plans that won’t work.  The House did the right thing.  Now it’s time for Senate Democrats and the President to do their part and pass the ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance Act’.”

WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger:
“The mobile phone market is a critical component of our nation’s economy and the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile deserves careful review.  In my view, the merger has the potential to provide significant network efficiencies that may help alleviate capacity constraints, enable enhanced service quality, and facilitate expansion of a 4G LTE nationwide network, which would in turn create opportunities for handset innovation and continued development of data-rich applications.
“I have confidence that the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission will take steps to ensure that the market remains competitive and that regional carriers continue to enjoy access to popular handsets and roaming arrangements on the nationwide networks.”

Title: Lee: After Vote, President Has Some Explaining to Do
Date: July 19, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – In anticipation of the House vote on the “Cut, Cap, and Balance Act,” Senator Mike Lee released the following statement:
“After the House passes the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, as I expect them to do, the President will have to explain to the American people why he, Harry Reid, and Senate Democrats are blocking the increase in the debt ceiling they requested.  So far, we have heard that the President opposes immediate spending cuts and a constitutional amendment that requires the federal government to balance it budget, which puts him directly at odds with the majority of Americans.
“Republicans have proposed a realistic compromise that gives the President what he has asked for in return for immediate spending cuts, reasonable deficit reduction over the next decade, and structural reforms that require Congress to balance its budget.  We currently have 39 co-sponsors in the Senate for this compromise, all Republicans.  It takes just a small number of Democrats and the President to do the right thing, protect the economy, and move past this stalemate.  After the House vote, it will be up to them.”

Title: Lee Demands President to Explain Social Security Threat
Date: July 14, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON- Today, Senator Mike Lee demanded President Barack Obama explain to the American people why he is threatening to withhold Social Security benefits from seniors, rather than seek budget alternatives.
“[W]e're bringing in about $200 billion a month in tax revenue. So there's more than enough tax revenue there to cover not only Social Security benefits but also interest on debt and a number of other things as well,” Senator Lee said from the floor of the Senate.
“That begs the question, why are Social Security beneficiaries the first to be threatened? Why is it their checks that the President is threatening to withhold first?  There is no explanation to this that he's offered, and I hereby demand one.
“I think our current retirees deserve more than to be used as pawns in a high-stakes political game; one that uses fear and uncertainty and doubt rather than reason and discussion and debate and willingness to compromise…
“I urge my colleagues and I urge all Americans to work together to find a solution to this; a solution that need not involve and should not involve threatening America's most vulnerable, including our retirees who rely each month on Social Security.”
Earlier today, Senator Lee posted to his website a list of alternatives he said the President should consider before cutting benefits for Social Security recipients.

“Are there no programs in the Energy Department, or Interior, or at HUD which we could suspend in order to ensure that our seniors receive the income they are expecting,” Lee added.

Date: July 11, 2011

WASHINGTON – Today Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar requesting clarification on new restrictions that serve to further prevent the development of America's abundant domestic resources.
Lee expressed concern that the Master Leasing Plan (MLP) process currently used by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to reform oil and gas leasing could be obstructingresponsible exploration for oil and gas. The MLP is viewed by Lee as an “unnecessary obstacle to an already thorough and public process.” The letter states:
We understand that the BLM professionals have defended the land use plans written pursuant to the established Resource Management Plan (RMP) process and so it remains unclear why the land use plans were deemed to be insufficient to address any new issues.
Joining Senator Lee on the letter are Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY), Michael Enzi (R-WY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), John Hoeven (R-ND) and Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT).

Title: Lee, GOP Senators Push for Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: June 29, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, the Senate Republican Caucus began a coordinated effort to push for passage of the S. J. Res 10, the Hatch Lee Balanced Budget Amendment.  Senator Mike Lee, a lead cosponsor of the bill, has consistently championed the need for binding, structural spending reforms like a constitutional amendment, even before joining the Senate. The bill would force Congress to balance its budget each year, limit spending to no more than 18% of GDP, and require a supermajority vote in both the House and Senate before raising taxes or increasing the nation’s debt ceiling.
“To truly fix the spending problem in Washington, we have to fundamentally change the rules that govern Congress,” said Lee. “If we want to eliminate deficits, reduce the national debt, get control of spending, preserve our constitutional priorities, and save our economy, it starts with the balanced budget amendment.  It is the only solution that guarantees future reforms will be enforced.”
A number of GOP Senators, including Lee, spoke in support of the amendment this morning on the Senate floor.  They will also hold a press conference at 11:30 am near the Ohio Clock outside the Senate Chamber.  Floor speeches on the balanced budget amendment will continue tomorrow, with Members planning to carry the message into the July 4

Title: DeMint, Lee, Paul Offer Bill to Begin Restoring Sound Money
Date: June 28, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) introduced the Sound Money Promotion Act, legislation that would remove the tax burden on gold and silver coins that have been declared legal tender by the federal government or state governments. On May 9, the State of Utah became the first state to recognize such gold and silver coins as legal tender for use within the state, and similar legislation has been introduced in 12 other states, including South Carolina.
“Thanks to the government’s reckless over-spending, continued bailouts, and the Federal Reserve’s easy money policy, this year the purchasing power of the dollar hit an all-time low in the several decades since we went off the gold standard,” said Senator DeMint. “In order to rebuild strength and confidence in our economy, we need both the fiscal discipline to cut wasteful spending and the monetary discipline to restrain further destructive monetizing of our debt. This legislation would encourage wider adoption of sound money measures, and that’s a step in the right direction.”
“Good monetary policy is an important part of a healthy and prosperous economy,” said Senator Lee. “Since the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the dollar has lost approximately 98 percent of its value. This bill is an important step towards a stable and sound currency whose value is protected from the Fed's printing press."
Senator Paul added, "As the government runs massive deficits, uncontrolled spending, and an increasingly unsustainable debt, governments and the bureaucrats in charge are often forced to take an easier approach: to monetize the debt, inflating the currency.  These implications can be devastating, leading to higher interest rates, which lead to higher borrowing costs and slower economic growth, but most importantly, destroying the savings and standard-of-living of all Americans.  This bill will hold politicians and the Federal Reserve accountable; acknowledging that states are serious about an alternative to a weakening dollar.”
The warning signs for our economic problems can no longer be ignored:
While the value of a dollar is at historic lows, the value of gold is at historic highs
Recently Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. outlook from “stable” to “negative,” meaning there is a 1 in 3 chance of an actual credit downgrade in the next two years
The world’s largest bond fund has dumped its U.S. debt-related holdings, over concerns that we will not get our fiscal house in order
The Federal Reserve is now buying 70 percent of U.S. Treasuries, set to surpass the holdings of both China and Japan combined

Title: Lee Signs Cut, Cap, Balance Pledge
Date: June 22, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee announced his support for a plan that would fundamentally change the way the federal government spends taxpayer money.  Known as “Cut, Cap, and Balance,” the proposal seeks to significantly reduce the annual deficit, place a statutory cap on federal spending at 18% of GDP, and pass the Hatch-Lee Balanced Budget Amendment out of both houses of Congress, all before allowing a vote on raising the nation’s debt ceiling.
“Cut, Cap, and Balance is the single most significant reform package Congress has seen in decades,” said Senator Lee. “It forces Washington to balance its books with strict, enforceable fiscal restraints and will cut spending significantly and immediately to improve our economy and create jobs.”
Earlier in the week, Senator Lee became the first Member of Congress to sign the Cut, Cap, Balance Pledge, which was announced at a press conference today.  The pledge signifies a commitment to passing all three provisions of the plan before a vote to increase the nation’s debt ceiling takes place.
“We cannot continue to rack up debt without first addressing the underlying problems that cause Washington to overspend,” Lee added. “Supporters of the pledge are saying we want to fix the problem before it gets any worse.  Opponents believe we can keep piling up debt and just hope Washington changes on its own.  We owe future generations more than that and have a responsibility to do the right thing for them today.”

Title: Senators Call on President to Shift Strategy in Afghanistan
Date: June 15, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Mike Lee (R-UT) and Tom Udall (D-NM) and 24 other senators sent a letter to President Obama today calling for a shift in strategy in Afghanistan ahead of next month's announced deadline to begin an accelerated transition to Afghan security forces. In the letter, the senators urge the President to use the deadline as an opportunity to begin a “sizable and sustained” drawdown of troops that puts the U.S. on a path toward removing all regular combat troops from the country.
Along with Merkley, Lee and Udall, the following senators have signed on to the letter: Max Baucus (D-MT), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Al Franken (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand(D-NY), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), FrankLautenberg (D-NJ), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).
In their letter, the senators noted that the primary objectives for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan have been largely met – including the removal of the Taliban government that sheltered al Qaeda, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the disruption of terrorist networks allied with Al Qaeda and those who planned the Sept. 11th attacks on the United States. Noting those successes and the ability to pursue counter-terrorism and humanitarian goals without a massive nation-building effort, the senators wrote, “the costs of prolonging the war far outweigh the benefits. It is time for the United States to shift course in Afghanistan.”
“We urge you to follow through on the pledge you made to the American people to begin redeployment of U.S. forces from Afghanistan this summer, and to do so in amanner that is sizable and sustained, and includes combat troops as well as logistical and support forces. We look forward to working with you to pursue a strategy in Afghanistan that makes our nation stronger and more secure,” the letter says.
The full text of the letter is below:
June 15, 2011
The President
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President:
We write to express our strong support for a shift in strategy and the beginning of a sizable and sustained reduction of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan, beginning in July 2011.
In 2001 the United States rightfully and successfully intervened in Afghanistan with the goals of destroying al Qaeda's safe haven, removing the Taliban government that sheltered al Qaeda, and pursuing those who planned the September 11 attacks on the United States. Those original goals have been largely met and today, as CIA Director Leon Panetta noted last June, "I think at most, we're looking at maybe 50 to 100, maybe less" al Qaeda members remaining in Afghanistan.
In addition, over the past few years, U.S. forces have killed or captured dozens of significant al Qaeda leaders. Then, on May 2, 2011, American Special Forces acting under your direction located and killed Osama bin Laden. The death of the founder of al Qaeda is a major blow that further weakens the terrorist organization.
From the initial authorization of military force through your most recent State of the Union speech, combating al Qaeda has always been the rationale for our military presence in Afghanistan. Given our successes, it is the right moment to initiate a sizable and sustained reduction in forces, with the goal of steadily redeploying all regular combat troops.
There are those who argue that rather than reduce our forces, we should maintain a significant number of troops in order to support a lengthy counter-insurgency and nation building effort. This is misguided. We will never be able to secure and police every town and village in Afghanistan. Nor will we be able to build Afghanistan from the ground up into a Western-style democracy.
Endemic corruption in Afghanistan diverts resources intended to build roads, schools, and clinics, and some of these funds end up in the hands of the insurgents. Appointments of provincial and local officials on the basis of personal alliances and graft leads to deep mistrust by the Afghan population. While it is a laudable objective to attempt to build new civic institutions in Afghanistan, this goal does not justify the loss of American lives or the investment of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.
Instead of continuing to be embroiled in ancient local and regional conflicts in Afghanistan, we must accelerate the transfer of responsibility for Afghanistan's development to the Afghan people and their government. We should maintain our capacity to eliminate any new terrorist threats, continue to train the Afghan National Security Forces, and maintain our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts. However, these objectives do not require the presence of over 100,000 American troops engaged in intensive combat operations.
Mr. President, according to our own intelligence officials, al Qaeda no longer has a large presence in Afghanistan, and, as the strike against bin Laden demonstrated, we have the capacity to confront our terrorist enemies with a dramatically smaller footprint. The costs of prolonging the war far outweigh the benefits. It is time for the United States to shift course in Afghanistan.
We urge you to follow through on the pledge you made to the American people to begin the redeployment of U.S. forces from Afghanistan this summer, and to do so in a manner that is sizable and sustained, and includes combat troops as well as logistical and support forces.
We look forward to working with you to pursue a strategy in Afghanistan that makes our nation stronger and more secure.

Title: Bishop, Chaffetz, Hatch, Lee Introduce Bill to Protect Utah from Presidential Monument Designations
Date: June 14, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Congressman Rob Bishop (UT-01), Chairman of the House Natural Resources National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, today introduced the Utah Lands Sovereignty Act, which would protect Utah from future national monument designations made by Presidential executive order.  Congressman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03) co-sponsored the bill and Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced companion legislation in the Senate. In 1950, Congress passed a law that prohibited the future establishment of national monuments in Wyoming except as authorized by Congress. This legislation would provide Utah with the same level of protection.
Last year, Congressman Bishop obtained the internal Treasured Landscapes memo created by the Department of Interior that lists as many as 14 possible new national monuments, two of which are located in Utah.  In total, the memo, which has since generated a groundswell of opposition across the West, identifies as many as 13 million acres of federally owned land and approximately 26 million acres of private land as areas that could potentially be subject to national monument designations.
“We have seen far too many attempts by this Administration to circumvent the open congressional process in order to execute their political agenda— the Treasured Landscapes memo is just one of the many examples.  While I’m not necessarily opposed to national monuments, I do not support efforts to create new designations, locking up thousands of acres of land, without the support of our local communities, residents and stakeholders,” said Congressman Bishop. “Last week’s remarks made by former DOI Secretary Bruce Babbitt are a reminder that the Antiquities Act is still being considered as an avenue to lock up millions of acres of public lands.  It is clear that former Secretary Babbitt isn’t in the business of protecting hard-working Utahns, and is instead looking to fulfill the agendas of a handful of radical special interest groups.  This legislation provides a necessary safeguard to protect Utah from future national monument designations made through executive fiat.”
During a press conference held on June 08, 2011, former Department of Interior (DOI) Secretary Bruce Babbitt suggested that the President use the Antiquities Act as executive fiat to pressure Congress into implementing restrictive new land management policies. Babbitt stated that, “By voicing his willingness to use the Antiquities Act as an alternative to Wilderness designation, the president can bring Congress to the table to work out conservation measures acceptable to reasonable stakeholders.”  He went on to say that, “the best way to defend the Antiquities Act is for the president to use it.”  [read the entire transcript here]
“Utahns are all too familiar with the consequences of presidential administrations creating national monuments without public input or congressional approval. We have been living with lost jobs, economic inactivity and other fallout from the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument since 1996. National monuments should not be created in secrecy and without the consent of Congress, this bill will ensure that they won’t here in Utah,” said Senator Hatch.
“The Antiquities Act is a misguided and outdated law that lends itself to abuse by the Executive Branch.  The Utah Lands Sovereignty Act improves the law to ensure local input is considered.  Decisions regarding control of our public lands rightfully belong to those closest to the situation and those most likely to be impacted.  Management of our public lands must reside in the hands of elected officials who are accountable to their local constituencies.  Congressional, state, and local leaders are the ones best equipped to manage these precious resources, and to make decisions regarding their future,” said Congressman Chaffetz.
“Proponents who have abused the system suggest Utah is being ‘honored’ with national monument designations.  Frankly, Utah has been ‘honored’ enough.  We lost nearly 2 million acres when the Clinton Administration created the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument without any input from Congress or state officials.  This bill will prevent that from happening again,” said Senator Lee.
The 1906 Antiquities Act allows the President to unilaterally designate new national monuments through executive order. This legislation would ensure that all future national monument designations in Utah are subject to the open Congressional process, which would provide Utahns and other westerners with the opportunity to have their voices heard.  Former President Bill Clinton used the Antiquities Act in 1996 to unilaterally designate the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah without ever consulting the public or state, local and federal officials.
The total number of acres targeted as possible new national monuments in the Treasured Landscapes memo is more than the states of Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Rhode Island combined.
Connecticut:                     3, 548,160          acres
New Jersey:                      5, 582,080          acres
Delaware:                         1, 250,560          acres
Rhode Island:                   988, 800             acres
Total:                               11, 369, 600       acres

Title: Lee Applauds Salazar's Decision to Abandon 'Wild Lands' Policy
Date: June 1, 2011

Content:
SALT LAKE CITY – Today, Senator Mike Lee applauded the decision by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to not designate any lands as “Wild Lands” in accordance with the 2011 Continuing Resolution. Senator Lee also indicated he stands ready to work with the Utah state legislature and other state and local officials to evaluate current wilderness study areas.
“Secretary Salazar has rightly recognized that Congress, and not the Department of the Interior, has the authority to designate wilderness areas; he has also recognized the importance of working with federal, state and local representatives in managing federal land,” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  “With nearly 70 percent of Utah lands under federal control, it is critical that we have a say early in the process to protect the rights of Utahns and all Americans to access and use federal lands.”
Last December, Secretary Salazar issued a controversial order directing the Bureau of Land Management to designate areas with wilderness characteristics as “wild lands,” a move that was widely seen as an end run around Congress’s authority to designate wilderness areas.  Within weeks, Senator Lee sent a letter to Secretary Salazar requesting all documents regarding the formation of the new policy, including meeting notes, electronic and hard-copy correspondence, and any maps that include Utah lands affected by the order.
Salazar’s failure to respond to the request forced Senator Lee to take other measures in order to encourage compliance.  He indicated he would put a “hold” on the nomination of Dan Ashe as Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service until all documents pertaining to the formulation of the “wild lands” policy had been turned over.  After more than four months, the Secretary’s office is expected to comply with the document request this week.
Today’s news was welcomed by Senator Lee as an acknowledgment that the Interior Department cannot and should not act unilaterally to impose a highly restrictive land use policy.
“The ‘wild lands’ policy that was abandoned by the Secretary today would have harmed the Utah economy, prevented job growth, blocked domestic energy development, and resulted in less revenue for our state,” Lee added.  “I appreciate that the Secretary has shifted his position and we can now work together with state and local officials to determine the future designation of our current wilderness study areas.”

Title: Senator Lee, Republican Colleagues Call on Administration to Produce Budget
Date: May 26, 2011

Content:
Senator Mike Lee (UT-R) and 22 of his Republican colleagues on Wednesday signed a letter to President Obama, calling attention to the failure of the democrats to produce a budget in 756 days. Lee and others are urging the Administration to work with budget experts to develop plans to allocate spending within a $2.6 trillion Debt Ceiling Budget.
"We believe it is irresponsible to spread panic instead of taking responsible action to calm the markets. We believe it is irresponsible to ignore the broken political system and the very real possibility that the debt ceiling might not be raised in time. And we believe it is irresponsible not to develop robust contingency plans now – just in case.
"We are calling on your Administration to immediately begin working with budget experts in Congress to allocate spending within a $2.6 trillion Debt Ceiling Budget. All agency heads should then be instructed to develop plans to make sure essential services would be funded on a priority basis."
"Finding real solutions is the preferred course of action. All spending programs must be on the table to achieve the structural reform necessary to avert a real debt crisis. We stand ready to be your willing partners in developing these solutions.
"This is no time to play politics. The American people are depending on all of us."

Title: Lee Opposes Appellate Court Nomination
Date: May 19, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee expressed his profound
objection to the nomination of Goodwin Liu as a Judge on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  In a
speech on the Senate floor, Senator Lee articulated two primary reasons for
opposing the nomination.
“First, I am truly dismayed by the lack of judgment
displayed in Professor Liu’s 2006 testimony regarding the confirmation of
Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,” said Lee, a member
of the Senate Judiciary Committee and former Assistant U.S. Attorney.
During the confirmation hearing of Justice Alito, Liu made
controversial and inflammatory remarks misrepresenting Justice Alito’s judicial
record.
“His comments about Justice Alito were offensive not simply
because they were unhelpful in his confirmation process, but because they were
a misleading and unwarranted personal attack on a dedicated public servant.”
“Professor Liu’s treatment of Justice Alito, and his last minute
and incomplete handling of the concerns raised by his remarks, lead me to
believe that he lacks the judgment and discretion to be confirmed to a
life-tenured position in the judiciary.”
Senator Lee also explained that “the judicial philosophy
espoused by Professor Liu is fundamentally inconsistent with the judicial
mandate to be a neutral arbiter of the Constitution and to uphold the rule of
law.”
“Throughout the course of numerous speeches, articles, and
books, Professor Liu has championed a philosophy that in my judgment is
incompatible with faithfully discharging the duties of an appellate court judge
in our constitutional republic,” he added.
Lee concluded: “Professor Liu’s appalling treatment of
Justice Alito leaves grave doubt in my mind as to whether he possesses the
requisite judgment to serve as a life-tenured judge.  And I have come to the conclusion that
Professor Liu’s extreme judicial philosophy is simply incompatible with the
proper role of a judge in our constitutional republic.  For these reasons, as well as those
articulated by many of my colleagues, I am compelled to oppose this
nomination.”

Title: LEE: Merger Should be Guided by What is Best for Consumers
Date: May 11, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee said the proposed
merger between AT&T and T-Mobile to create the largest wireless carrier in
the country should be reviewed carefully to ensure the best outcome for
consumers.  Lee, the Ranking Member on
the Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, said that he favors market
approaches to developing mobile networks, but that care should be taken to
ensure the merger preserves robust competition nationally and from smaller
regional carriers, promotes consumer choices, and encourages innovation.
“An important question before our Subcommittee today is
whether the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile is a positive step
along the path to world-class wireless broadband throughout the United States,”
Senator Lee said during his opening remarks this morning. “A merger between the
two companies may provide significant and immediate efficiencies that will
enable enhanced service quality, fewer blocked or dropped calls, and increasing
data speeds.”
“At the same time, I share some of the concerns expressed by
my colleague, Senator Kohl, and believe it is our responsibility—along with the
Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Communications
Commission—to ensure that the proposed merger would not produce damaging
anticompetitive effects,” he added.
“A critical question, therefore, is whether the smaller
regional carriers can effectively compete in a post-merger market,” Lee said,
citing potential conflicts regarding the smaller carriers’ access to data
roaming networks and the most popular devices, like iPhones.
Lee concluded: “Our analysis of the proposed merger between
AT&T and T-Mobile should be guided by what will be best for consumers—in
the form of prices, service quality, and range of choice.”

Title: Lee Backs Balanced Budget Proposal
Date: May 10, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee spoke in support of a
budget proposal that will balance the federal budget over 10 years, save
Medicare, enact real tax reform, and put the country on fiscally sustainable
path.  Senators Jim DeMint (SC), Tom
Coburn (OK), David Vitter (LA), Marco Rubio (FL), Richard Burr (NC), James
Risch (ID), and Ron Johnson (WI) joined the measure, principally authored by
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.  In
support of the budget, Senator Lee released the following statement:
“The most important challenge we have as a country is
getting our fiscal house in order and Senator Toomey has developed a
responsible plan to address it,” said Senator Lee. “While the President has
proposed a budget that never balances and creates deficits and debt as far as
the eye can see, Senator Toomey’s proposal moves the country in a fiscally
responsible direction, balances the budget over a reasonable amount of time,
simplifies and reforms our complex tax code, and significantly reduces spending
to a manageable percentage of GDP.
“This budget represents yet another set of good ideas from
Senate Republicans while our friends across the aisle have still not offered a
budget of their own, despite a legal requirement to submit one.  I applaud Senator Toomey for his leadership
and look forward to debating his and other budget plans.”

Title: Lee Statement on President's Deficit Reduction Speech
Date: April 13, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee responded to the President’s
speech on deficit reduction:
“While it is encouraging the President has finally decided
to participate in the deficit debate, it is disappointing that he has offered a
so-called framework that ignores the destructive, burdensome long-term costs of
entitlements and reversed his position on increasing taxes on the American
people.
“What the President calls ‘savings’ won’t scratch the
surface of our annual deficit and, without a plan to balance the budget, the
President continues to increase the national debt to unfathomable and
irresponsible levels, which threatens our future prosperity.
“His calls to reduce our most bloated entitlement programs
by roughly $30 to $40 billion per year are woefully inadequate to address an
annual deficit approaching $1.7 trillion. 
The President completely ignores Social Security’s contribution to the deficit
in the coming years.
“Most disappointing is that the President no longer believes
tax relief is important to protect our economic recovery.  In December of last year, the President said extending
the Bush-era tax cuts ‘will spur our private sector to create millions of new
jobs, and add momentum that our economy badly needs.’
“Less than five months later, the President’s framework
proposes historic tax increases on the very segment of our economy on which we
are depending to create those new jobs.
“This is not just a political flip-flop.  It’s a reversal that will create greater
instability in our economy and threaten to turn around the small gains we’ve
made in employment.
“Republicans in Congress have submitted dozens of ideas to
reduce our deficit, balance our budget, restrain spending, and create
jobs.  Many of us stand willing to work
with the President and together make the difficult choices to put the country
on a fiscally responsible path.
“The President has proposed only symbolic spending ‘cuts’
and higher taxes for Americans.  His
speech today shows he is simply not serious about real deficit reduction.”

Title: Lee Expresses Comments on DoJ Decision  Regarding Google-ITA
Date: April 8, 2011

Content:
Washington, DC – Today, Senator Mike
Lee (R-UT), Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, commented on the Department of Justice’s decision
to impose stringent conditions on Google’s acquisition of ITA Software and
reiterated his call for antitrust oversight of Google’s search-related
businesses.
“Today’s announcement by the
Department of Justice (DOJ) outlining rigorous conditions for Google’s proposed
acquisition of ITA Software is an important step in applying antitrust laws to
the company’s predominant position in the realm of Internet search,” said
Senator Lee.  “As the DOJ recognized, Google’s
unique presence as an Internet gatekeeper raises serious concerns about
activities that may limit competition, reduce consumer choice, and thwart
innovation.  Continued scrutiny is
essential as Google extends its reach into a variety of vertical search markets
and online services.  As a member of the
Antitrust Subcommittee, I will continue to work to ensure vibrant competition
in this and other areas of our economy.”
On March 10, 2011, Senator Lee
sent a letter to the Subcommittee Chairman Senator Herb Kohl calling for
oversight hearings into Google’s practices that could harm competition, and
specifically pointed to the acquisition of ITA Software, which powers sites
like Kayak, Travelocity, and
Orbitz.
“As you know, the DOJ is in the process of determining
whether to approve Google’s proposed acquisition of ITA Software – a deal that
could potentially provide Google with the ability to control the travel search
vertical market,” Senator Lee wrote.
“Oversight by our
Subcommittee is essential in helping free markets flourish in this important
area of our economy.  Ensuring robust competition will benefit consumers,
spur innovation, and lead to job creation in our nation’s high-tech Internet
economy,” Senator Lee added. “Vigorous antitrust enforcement is almost always
preferable to a system of government regulations, which will inevitably be more
costly and less efficient than a free market unencumbered by anticompetitive
restrictions.”

Title: Lee: Lack of Libya Debate "Shameful and Discouraging"
Date: April 5, 2011

Content:
Along with Senator Rand Paul, Senator Lee recently cosponsored a resolution that stipulated: “The President does not have the power to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”
The quote comes from remarks then-Senator Barack Obama made in 2007.  Today, Senator Paul offered the resolution as a motion to the pending business on the floor and requested just 30 minutes for debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid denied the request and only allowed 10 minutes for debate, then sought to table the motion to avoid a vote on it.  The vote to table the motion passed.
“We channel the war power in the Constitution so as to make sure these discussions always come to the forefront, always be brought up by the elected representatives of the people in Congress,” Lee said on the Senate floor just before the vote. “And for that reason, although we give power to the President to be the Commander in Chief in Article Two of the Constitution, in Article One of the Constitution we reserve that power – that power to declare war to Congress.
“This is how we guarantee the people’s voice will be heard and that people’s sons and daughters won’t be sent off to war without some public debate and discussion by those who have been duly elected by the people and stand accountable to the people.”
Lee’s remarks were cut short as time expired.

Title: Lee, Hatch, Senate GOP Back Constitutional Amendment to Restrain Spending
Date: March 31, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, with the full backing of the Senate GOP Caucus, Senator Lee introduced an amendment to the Constitution to balance the federal budget. Sponsored by fellow Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and four others as principle cosponsors, the Hatch-Lee Balanced Budget Amendment is one of the most significant pieces of legislation introduced this year aimed at putting the country on a path to fiscal sustainability.
The central component of the bill states that total spending for the fiscal year must not exceed total receipts and must not exceed more than eighteen percent of the economy, as measured by gross domestic product.
Only a two-thirds vote by the House and Senate would allow Congress to run a deficit for a “specific excess” or raise taxes.  Additionally, the amendment stipulates that a three-fifths vote would be necessary to increase the debt limit.
Two other very limited exceptions to the amendment allow spending in excess of receipts during a national security emergency or during a time of war.  Three-fifths of Congress would be required to vote for a specific excess during a military conflict declared to be an imminent and serious military threat to our national security; and a just a simple majority vote would be needed during a declared war.  The law becomes effective five years after ratification.
“When it comes to spending, Congress has proven it cannot be trusted to live within its means or spend only what the federal government takes in,” said Senator Lee. “Our annual deficit approaching $1.7 trillion and national debt of almost $15 trillion are a significant threat to our economy, job growth, and future prosperity.  Only a structural restraint on spending, like a constitutional amendment, will force Congress to make the tough decisions about our national priorities and prevent digging the country deeper in debt.”
Once the bill is voted on and approved by two-thirds of Congress, it must then be ratified by three-fourths of all state legislatures to become an amendment to the Constitution.  A bill earlier this year sponsored by Senator Lee expressing support for a balanced budget amendment received 58 votes in the Senate. All 47 Senate Republicans are supporting the amendment.

Title: Sen. Lee and Rep. Bishop Introduce Land Conveyance Legislation for Mantua, Utah
Date: March 30, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON
– Today, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Congressman Rob Bishop (R-UT) introduced legislation to transfer three parcels of federally owned land in Box Elder County to the town of Mantua, Utah.  Specifically, The
Box Elder Utah Land Conveyance Act
would convey nearly 32 acres of land that could be used by the community for multiple purposes, including the potential development of a new city cemetery, a new town hall, fire station, park or elementary school.
The parcels of land included in this legislation are located on the south end of town below 100 South and west of Main Street and Willard Peak Road.  They are part of a larger tract originally owned by Hans Rasmussen, an early settler of Mantua, whose family deeded the land to the U.S. Forest Service in 1941 for $1.00.  Under this legislation, the city of Mantua would not be required to pay for the land, but would assume all costs associated with surveying and development.
“
It is a testament to the growth of our state and cities like Mantua that this bill is necessary,
” said Senator Lee, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “
The city can use the land productively and the federal government has no pressing need for it.  With the help of Rep. Bishop, I hope we can move this bill quickly through Congress.
”
“
There is absolutely no valid reason why the federal government should maintain ownership of this land, which has sat vacant and virtually unused for decades, when it could otherwise be utilized by the town of Mantua to meet the current challenges associated with its growth and expansion,
” said Congressman Bishop, whose district encompasses all of Box Elder County.  “
The parcels of land we’re asking to have conveyed are relatively small in size but would have a significant impact on the future of this community.
”
In addition, Senator Lee is also introducing legislation to return forest service land to the town of Alta for a community center and fire station.

Title: Lee, McCain Submit Bill to Reduce Ownership of Federal Lands
Date: March 17, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator John McCain of Arizona introduced legislation to reduce federal ownership of certain public lands and allow the land to be sold for more productive purposes.  The bill directs the Secretary of Interior to dispose of federal lands identified in a 1997 Clinton Administration report deemed suitable for sale.  Under this legislation, the amount of land sold would be equal to roughly 1% of all land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and less than one half of one percent of all federal land.  Representative Jason Chaffetz, also of Utah, recently introduced a similar bill in the House.
“It’s been more than a decade since the land was deemed suitable for disposal and there is no critical need for the federal government to hold on to it,” said Senator Lee. “The sale of the land alone could generate more than a $1 billion, and there is further economic benefit of putting the land to good use.  That will mean jobs, future growth, and better prosperity for the surrounding areas.”
“It’s good for the state of Utah and I am happy to work with Senator McCain and my fellow Utahn Representative Chaffetz in the House in supporting the move.”
“The federal budget, much like the household budgets of millions of American families, is stretched alarmingly thin in today’s fiscal climate,” said Senator McCain.  “Congress must explore all possible avenues for reducing our $1.4 trillion deficit and ballooning $14 trillion national debt.  Our legislation aims to reduce the federal estate in a way that’s mindful of how we currently manage our public lands and seeks to dispose land that the federal government simply does not want.”
The bill is titled “The Reducing Federal Ownership of Public Lands Act”.

Title: Lee: Support for CR is a ‘Losing Strategy’
Date: March 15, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah announced he would continue to oppose any continuation of current spending that did not seriously address our deficit and debt, and lacked structural spending reforms.   Lee said he plans to vote against the ‘continuing resolution’ that is expected to come to the Senate floor this week because the so-called spending ‘cuts’ in the bill are inadequate and it does not take steps to prevent future overspending.
“It is unfortunate that Members of Congress in both parties are supporting a losing strategy, rather than doing what is right for the country,” said Lee. “The continuing resolution maintains unsustainable spending levels despite widespread agreement that we need meaningful reductions.  The question before the Senate is whether we are going to take bold action now to reduce our deficit and control spending, or keep putting it off and drive the country further into debt.
“I am pleased to see a growing number of Members beginning to see the budget debate in these terms and have pledged to oppose additional continuing resolutions.  My hope is that we attract enough support to finally put an end to this short-sighted tactic and forge a long-term agreement that is right for the American people.”

Title: Bipartisan Coalition of Senators: Stop and Study Proposed Debit Card Rule
Date: March 15, 2011

Content:
(U.S. SENATE)  – Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), Bob Corker (R-TN), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Ben Nelson (D-NE), Tom Carper (D-DE), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Chris Coons (D-DE), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Pat Toomey (R-PA) today introduced legislation to protect consumers, small businesses and rural and small community banks and credit unions from a proposed rule regarding transaction fees on debit cards.
“Price controls are almost always problematic,” said Lee, who is Ranking Member on the Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. “If the rule remains in place, retailers, banks and consumers will lose out in the long run through higher costs and limited choices.  I believe we can form a better solution that does not unnecessarily burden small businesses and local financial institutions or pass fees on to the customer.  The delay in implementing the rule will allow us to find options that benefit everyone.”
The bipartisan coalition of Senators today introduced the
Debit Interchange Fee Study Act
in response to concerns of the impact of a proposed rule from the Federal Reserve on consumers and small businesses.
The Federal Reserve is proposing a rule that will cap the interchange fee per debit card transaction at 12 cents, regardless of the size of the transaction. Consumer advocacy organizations have raised concerns that this proposed rule will significantly impact consumers because small banks may limit the size of a debit card transaction or end free checking services.
The Debit Interchange Fee Study Act
suspends implementation of the proposed rule and calls for a two year study of debit interchange fees.
“The stakes are simply too high to move forward with this rule without a closer look at the impact on consumers, credit unions, community banks, and the small businesses and jobs they sustain” said Tester, a member of the Senate Banking Committee.  “That is why we need to make sure we stop and study these proposed rules before implementing anything.”
“The federal government shouldn’t be telling private companies what they can charge for goods and services; that’s price fixing, and that’s exactly what the Durbin amendment does,” said Corker, a member of the Senate Banking Committee.  “The hastily passed Durbin amendment will have numerous unintended consequences for debit card users, including reduced access and increased fees.  I’m sympathetic to retailers’ concerns and am open to a better solution, but the Durbin amendment isn’t the answer.”
“I’m concerned that the proposed rule dictating debit card interchange fees willhave a harmful effect on consumers, small banks and credit unions,” Carper said.  “This legislation will allow Congress and federal regulators to take a thoughtful pause and avoid unintended consequences.”
“The government should not be in the business of setting price controls on any product and implementing this rule would set a precedent for that,” said Roberts. “We need more time to sufficiently review this regulation, because failing to get it right ultimately means it will fall on the backs of consumers, merchants and financial institutions, including our small community banks. And at a time when Americans are watching every penny, we cannot afford to let that happen.”
"The concerns raised by Fed Chairman Bernanke and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair about the potential harm to credit unions and community banks require further study of the unintended consequences of this rule," Coons said.  "Any government regulation of interchange fees should yield some tangible consumer benefit, but the Fed's current cap offers no such guarantee.  Further study will help yield a more thoughtful, long-term solution."

Washington, DC -  Senator Michael S. Lee (R-UT) today called for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee to conduct an oversight hearing on Google Inc.  Lee joins Chairman Herb Kohl in encouraging hearings on the business practices of the dominant search firm. Lee is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee.
In a letter to Kohl, Lee noted that those who follow the tech industry, as well as those responsible for enforcing antitrust laws, have concerns that Google could be acting to harm competition.
“The powerful position Google occupies in the general search arena creates myriad opportunities for anticompetitive behavior,” Lee writes. “The Deputy Director for Antitrust within the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission, Howard Shelanski, recently observed that a ‘hypothetical search engine’ with various ‘scale and network economies’ might become a ‘must have’ for consumers and thereby more effectively engage in ‘anticompetitive discrimination.’”
Given its prominent position in the search and search-advertising markets, Google in some ways acts as a gatekeeper over a variety of Internet businesses.
In particular, Lee’s letter points to Google’s proposed acquisition of ITA software, which could potentially provide Google with the ability to control the travel search vertical market, currently populated by sites like Kayak, Travelocity, and Orbitz.
“Google’s position as the preeminent search engine may be abused so as to disadvantage competing vertical search sites to the detriment of advertisers and internet users,” Lee writes.
Lee adds that Google’s acquisition of personal data through searches and its many products, such as Gmail, Google Checkout, Google Books, and Google Web History, couldpresent serious privacy issues.
“Google’s powerful position as an Internet gatekeeper reduces the company’s incentive to compete with other search engines by providing enhanced privacy protection for consumers.”
“The combination of behavioral and personal information enables Google to generate consumer data that is unprecedented in scale and scope. These activities raise serious privacy concerns and may be indicative of an important market that is largely unconstrained by competition.  Antitrust enforcement may unlock beneficial competition for the protection of user privacy and avert the need for additional privacy regulation.”
Utah has a growing tech sector with several large companies set to expand their businesses in the state, and was awarded Forbes “Best State for Businesses” in 2010.
“As an increasing number of companies with an online presence expand and create jobs, we want to make to maintain and competitive and business-friendly environment,” Lee said.
The full text of Senator Lee’s letter to Subcommittee Chairman Herb Kohl is included below:
March 10, 2011
The Honorable Herb Kohl
Chairman
Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee
224 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairman Kohl:
I write to express my strong concerns relating to Google Inc.’s possible abuse of its predominant position in the general internet search arena and the need for vigorous antitrust oversight and enforcement in this area.  As the new ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I look forward to working with you to hold a hearing on this important issue.  I recognize and applaud your efforts in this area of vital importance.
The proper functioning of our nation’s free-enterprise system is critical during the current economic downturn.   Enforcement of the antitrust laws is especially important for sectors in which the United States has been a leader, such as the e-commerce and online advertising industries.  Antitrust enforcement is far preferable to the creation of inefficient government regulation and bureaucracy that could hamper innovation in these crucial industries.  Internet search is of particular concern to me because Utah – recently labeled by Newsweek as the “new economic Zion” due to its growing number of high tech businesses – has a significant interest in preserving open competition in this importantarea of our economy.
Many commentators, as well as those responsible for enforcing antitrust laws, have voiced serious questions concerning whether Google has acted to harm competition.  Given its prominent position in the search and search advertising markets, Google in some ways acts as a gatekeeper over a variety of internet businesses.  Among other things, commentators have expressed concern that Google may be using its position to harm specialized (or so-called “vertical”) search sites.  If allowed to compete free of restraints, vertical search sites – such as travel, mapping, and shopping sites – could attract users and advertisers from Google’s search platforms.  Some vertical search sites have accused Google of using its power to deprive those websites of internet traffic by biasing the display of its search-advertising and search results.
Likewise, some claim that Google may disadvantage rivals in subtle, potentially undetectable, ways.  Indeed, Google’s founders recognized as early as 1998 that “a search engine could add a small factor to search results from ‘friendly’ companies, and subtract a factor from results from competitors” and that “[t]his type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market.”[
1
]  Whether this type of behavior is occurring is a question of great practical significance.  The powerful position Google occupies in the general search arena creates myriad opportunities for anticompetitive behavior.  The Deputy Director for Antitrust within the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission, Howard Shelanski, recently observed that a “hypothetical search engine” with various “scale and network economies” might become a “must have” for consumers and thereby more effectively engage in “anticompetitive discrimination.” According to Shelanski, “once one realizes there could be an application . . . that is more essential to consumers than any particular downstream network, then the locus of possible bottleneck discrimination . . . shifts upstream.”[

]
The DOJ has extensively analyzed bias in the display of airfares to travel agents on airline-owned computerized reservation systems (“CRSs”) and concluded that “[p]erhaps the most effective and insidious method by which an airline can use a CRS with market power to punish other carriers for competing with it is secretly to bias the system in favor of the host carrier.”  The DOJ went on to point out that “[b]ias influences, and may mislead, the travel agent who uses CRS in such a way as to cause airline ticket revenues to shift from competing carriers to the host.”[
3
]  In a similar way, Google’s position as the preeminent search engine may be abused so as to disadvantage competing horizontal and vertical search sites to the detriment of advertisers and internet users.  As you know, the DOJ is in the process of determining whether to approve Google’s proposed acquisition of ITA Software – a deal that could potentially provide Google with the ability to control the travel search vertical market.
In addition to its consideration of the contemplated ITA acquisition, I believe the DOJ should also investigate whether Google’s powerful position as an internet gatekeeper reduces the company’s incentive to compete with other search engines by providing enhanced privacy protection for consumers.  Google collects an unequaled amount of information about consumers through its search platform, including data about web searches, reactions to online advertising, and precise geographic location for both mobile devices and personal computers.  Google also gathers an enormous amount of consumer information through its related products and services, including  Gmail, Google Checkout, Google Books, and Google Web History.  Google has admitted that for nearly three years it used its Street View mapping service – without notice or consent – to access unprotected Wi-Fi networks and amass extensive information about theinternet activities of American consumers in all 50 states.  The combination of behavioral and personal information enables Google to generate consumer data that is unprecedented in scale and scope.  These activities raise serious privacy concerns and may be indicative of an important market that is largely unconstrained by competition.  Antitrust enforcement may unlock beneficial competition for the protection of user privacy and avert the need for additional privacy regulation.
Oversight by our Subcommittee is essential in helping free markets flourish in this important area of our economy.  Ensuring robust competition will benefit consumers, spur innovation, and lead to job creation in our nation’s high-tech internet economy.  Utah, ranked by Forbes magazine as the “Best State for Business” in 2010, will likewise benefit from the preservation of competition in this area.  Vigorous antitrust enforcement is almost always preferable to a system of government regulations, which will inevitably be more costly and less efficient than a free market unencumbered by anticompetitive restrictions.
I very much appreciate your efforts in this regard and look forward to our work together.
Sincerely,
Michael S. Lee
Ranking Member
Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee

Title: Lee Opposes Status Quo on Deficit and Debt
Date: March 9, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – After voting against both the Democrat and GOP spending bills, Senator Mike Lee of Utah released the following statement:
“The fight over cutting $10 billion or $60 billion is not a serious discussion about how to fix what’s broken,” said Lee.  “It does not begin to address our massive $1.65 trillion deficit, and completely ignores any long-term structural restraints necessary to impede Congress’s insatiable appetite to spend.  If you think of our annual deficit as a football field, the Democrat proposal moves the ball just over half a yard toward the goal line.  The Republican proposal moves it just three and a half yards.  That is not a winning strategy for the country.
“As long as these spending proposals maintain the status quo on our deficit and debt without instituting some measure of external structural control, I will oppose them.”
Senator Lee has proposed a Balanced Budget Amendment that would act as a strict structural restraint on spending and force Congress to prioritize its constitutional obligations. During an interview this week, Senator Lee reiterated his willingness to filibuster any effort to increase the national debt, without first voting on a Balanced Budget Amendment.
“I will resist any effort to raise the national debt ceiling, and that will include utilizing the filibuster rules,” Lee said.  See the full interview here:

Title: Lee to Oppose Spending Proposal
Date: March 2, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah announced that he would vote against a proposed spending bill intended to fund government activity for two weeks. The Senator said the continuing resolution did not reflect the message the American people sent last year to make significant cuts to government spending and reduce the national debt.
"The proposal is a disappointing failure on the part of both parties to seriously address the economic meltdown we face from our massive deficit and growing national debt," said Lee. "While some have been patting themselves on the back for proposing $4 billion in so-called ‘cuts’, in reality, this bill fully funds billions upon billions of dollars in wasteful, duplicative programs that should be eliminated, reduced, or reformed.
"Support for the ‘continuing resolution’ means continuing Congress's unfortunate record of driving this country into debt. If a $1.6 trillion deficit and $15 trillion national debt do not force this Congress into bold action, then I have little patience for procedural games that kick the can an inch or two down the street.
"This is not the kind of legislation the people of Utah sent me to Washington to support and I cannot in good faith do so."

Title: Lee Delivers Maiden Speech, Urges Balanced Budget Reform
Date: March 1, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today delivered his first official speech on the Senate floor, focusing on the need to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. Lee has been a staunch advocate for structural budgetary restraints that will hold Congress accountable for how it spends taxpayer resources.  The speech included a call to move past the traditional partisan divides over spending and make the tough choices to reduce the country’s massive national debt.
“In the past there has been a great debate between, on the one hand, some Republicans who have been unwilling to cut some programs - to consider in any context cuts in the area of, say, national defense. You've had others who perhaps from the other party have been unwilling to consider any cuts to any entitlement program.
“But we're now faced with a scenario in which both sides of the aisle can understand that our perpetual deficit spending habit places in jeopardy every single aspect of the operations of the federal government.
“We now face a moment when both liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, regardless of what they most want to protect most in their federal government, have to realize that what they most want to protect is placed in grave jeopardy by our current spending practices.
“I'm troubled by the fact that as we approach debate surrounding a continuing resolution, this week a continuing resolution is likely to operate for just a few weeks to keep the government funded, we're still talking about adding on an annualized basis to our national debt at $1.5 trillion a year.
“I think the American people deserve better. I know that they demand better. And some of the things that we saw in the 2010 election cycle portends something greater than what we're going to see in the 2012 election cycle. Americans want Congress to balance the budget and they want us to do something about it, more than just talking about it.
“Benjamin Franklin used to say,  ‘He'll cheat without scruple, who can without fear.’ I think the congressional corollary to that might be that Congress, which can continue to engage in perpetual deficit spending, will continue to do unless or until the people require that Congress to put itself in a straitjacket. That's the straitjacket we need. That's why I'm proposing this [Balanced Budget] Amendment.”
Senator Lee has recently introduced a “sense of the Senate” amendment to a bill being debated in the Senate today that would put Members on record as supporting or opposing a nonspecific Balanced Budget proposal.
Lee’s specific constitutional amendment, SJ Res 5, cosponsored by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, includes the following three pillars: (1) requiring a balanced budget for each fiscal year, (2) limiting federal spending to no more than 18 percent of GDP, and (3) requiring a two-thirds vote in both Houses of Congress in order to increase taxes, raise the debt ceiling, or run a specific deficit in a particular year.

Title: Lee Pushes Vote on Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: February 27, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah introduced legislation that would signify the level of support in the Senate for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.  Added as an amendment to a patent reform bill being debated today, Lee’s “sense of the Senate” stipulates that “Congress should pass and the States should agree to an amendment to the Constitution requiring a Federal balanced budget.”  Lee said it was important to get all Senators on the record before the Senate votes on a continuing resolution to fund the government or an increase in the debt limit.
“The debate over America’s fiscal future must begin with a vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment,” said Lee.  “The American people should know whether or not the Senate is serious about getting spending under control and reducing the national debt before we vote on even a short-term extension of current spending.  While I will continue to push for a full vote on the Lee-Kyl Balanced Budget Amendment, the ‘sense of the Senate’ motion is a reasonable place to start.“
Though Senator Lee does have a specific Balanced Budget Amendment proposal, the motion does not stipulate the details of any particular amendment.  The purpose of the motion is to gauge support for a strong structural restraint on spending that will hold Congress accountable.

Title: Lee: Don't Hit Taxpayers, Show Fiscal Restraint
Date: February 22, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Mike Lee of Utah released the following statement ahead of next week’s budget debate and amid accusations of a potential government shutdown:
“The question remains whether Senate Democrats will follow President Obama in penalizing the American people with massive tax increases, or whether they will instead take responsibility for years of excess and make sensible spending reductions in the current budget.   Frankly, American taxpayers are not to blame for our massive deficit and we should not look to balance our budget on their backs.  Americans are overtaxed as it is.  The charge lies with Congress to show some fiscal restraint.
“Further, the threat from Democrats to shut down the government in order to protect excessive spending is utterly disappointing.  That threat is unnecessary, irresponsible, and unwarranted.  Republicans have suggested closing a mere fraction of our $1.5 trillion deficit, and this suggestion deserves serious consideration without resorting to talk of panic. This is another unfortunate reminder of why we need a procedural restraint, such as the Lee-Kyl proposal for a Balanced Budget Amendment, so we can avoid the kind of politics that could endanger our prosperity.”

Title: Lee Applauds Gov. Walker
Date: February 22, 2011

Content:
Washington – Today, Senator Mike Lee released the following statement regarding Wisconsin’s state budget battle and President Obama injecting himself into the controversy:
“The states have traditionally been laboratories for policy reform and I support Governor Walker’s attempt to take the harder, but fiscally responsible, road.  As in many states, Governor Walker faces difficult challenges and not a lot of good answers.  I applaud his effort to make tough decisions and stand firm for what he believes is the best for the people of Wisconsin.
“Governor Walker’s courage stands in stark contrast to the budget proposal put forth by President Obama, who unfortunately waded into this purely state matter recently.  It is unclear why the President would ignore the coming crisis in the federal retirement system, but feel it necessary to publicly comment on Wisconsin’s.  We need courageous leadership from Congress and the President to address the nation’s fiscal challenges. My Balanced Budget Amendment, which holds Washington accountable for prioritizing our constitutional obligations, would be a strong first step to doing just that.”

Title: Senators Lee and Kyl Release Balanced Budget Amendment
Date: January 27, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC
—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The amendment includes three pillars: (1) requiring a balanced budget for each fiscal year, (2) limiting federal spending to no more than 18 percent of GDP, and (3) requiring a two-thirds vote in both Houses of Congress in order to increase taxes, raise the debt ceiling, or run a specific deficit in a particular year.
Senator Kyl stated, “We can’t wait any longer to ensure Congress will rein in wasteful Washington spending. This balanced budget and spending limit amendment will do just that.”
“The federal government is too big and too expensive and the temptation for Congress to continue to spend billions and even trillions of dollars it does not have is simply too high.  Again and again, even well-intentioned efforts to restrain deficit spending through the normal budget process have failed,” said Senator Lee. “A balanced budget amendment is the only certain method to ensure that the federal government consistently lives within its means.  This past November’s election made clear that the American people will no longer tolerate reckless government spending and ever-expanding federal debt. The amendment that Senator Kyl and I have introduced is the essential first step in putting the nation’s fiscal house in order.”
In addition to Senator Lee and Senator Kyl, the number two Senate Republican leader, the amendment has received broad support from conservative leaders including Senators Jim DeMint, Rand Paul, David Vitter, Pat Toomey, Marco Rubio and John Thune as original co-sponsors as well as endorsements from conservative organizations like the Club for Growth, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, and Americans for a Balanced Budget Amendment.

Title: Senator Lee receives committee assignments
Date: January 26, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC
—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today received committee assignments for his first term, which include seats on the Judiciary; Energy and Natural Resources; Foreign Relations; and Joint Economic committees.
“I’m thrilled about these committee assignments and look forward to having an active role in each. These seats will allow me to work on issues that are crucial to the Utah delegation, as well as the country as a whole. It’s time for the real work to begin.”
Serving on the Energy and Natural Resources committee has been of particular interest to Senator Lee, Energy and Natural Resources committee, which will enable him to focus on freeing up federal lands for economic uses to create jobs, encourage economic growth and lead the U.S. towards energy independence. The Senator also plans to work towards creating greater certainty for regulations and bringing the lands under more local control.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is chaired by Senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-VA), and is responsible for holding hearings prior to the Senate votes on confirmation of federal judges. Senator Lee’s background in Constitutional law and his time serving as Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s law clerk have well-prepared him for this assignment.
The Foreign Relations Committee is chaired by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) and addresses issues of national security, U.S. boundaries, as well as foreign, economic, military, technical and humanitarian assistance.
The Joint Economic Committee is lead by Congresswoman Maloney (D-NY), and is a bicameral committee composed of 10 members from the Senate, and ten from the House of Representatives. The committee provides continuous attention to matters relating to the U.S. economy.
The Senate is divided into twenty committees to accommodate for the high volume and complexity of the legislation at hand.  Committee assignments are made by senior party members.

Title: Senator Lee calls on Secretary Salazar for disclosure of key documents, meeting
Date: January 6, 2011

Content:
WASHINGTON, DC
—Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today sent a letter to Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to request that all communications relating to Secretarial Order 3310 be disclosed to the public. The Senator also asked for a personal meeting to discuss this major policy that will detrimentally impact Utah communities.
“The policies set forth by Secretary Salazar will increase uncertainty for Utah businesses that involve federal lands, and also hinder energy production at a time when developing domestic energy sources is so critical,” said Senator Lee. “This order will result in lost jobs, investment and revenues at a time when we can least afford it. I will not sit idly by while the federal government puts a chokehold on our most valuable resources.”
The order allows the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to designate areas with wilderness characteristics as “Wild Lands” and to retain their wilderness characteristics. This designation imposes the most restrictive land use policies available, placing severe limitations on public access, inhibiting energy producing activities, and forbidding motorized and mechanized recreation.
In addition to the negative impact this policy will have on Utah’s economy, Interior’s action undercuts previous assurances given to Utah’s elected officials.
“Simply relabeling these lands as ‘Wild Lands’ seems to be a game of semantics,” said Senator Lee, “and is an unacceptable departure from Secretary Salazar’s previous assurances.”
