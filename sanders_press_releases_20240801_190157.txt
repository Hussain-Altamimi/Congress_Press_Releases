Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Voting “No” on Tax Deal
Date: August 1, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement after voting no on the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, which would deliver tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to some of the country’s largest and most profitable corporations:

I strongly support restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit from the American Rescue Plan that reduced childhood poverty in America by over 40 percent.

I cannot, in good conscience, however, vote for the tax package that is being voted upon today.

At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we should not be giving tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to some of the largest and most profitable corporations in America.

Incredibly, this legislation would hand out a $2 billion retroactive tax break each to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – some of the most profitable defense contractors in the world.

Further, at a time when Artificial Intelligence and automation threatens to displace millions of American workers, this legislation could provide billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies like Amazon, Google, Verizon, and Facebook to replace workers with machines or robots.

Three years ago, as part of the American Rescue Plan, Congress passed an expanded Child Tax Credit that put $300 a month per child directly into the bank accounts of tens of millions of families. This provision alone lifted nearly 4 million children out of poverty.

The tax bill on the floor today is only one-tenth the size of the Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan and would only last for three years. When all is said and done, this bill would provide at least $3 in corporate tax breaks for every $1 in tax cuts for working families with children. That is not a good deal.

Title: NEWS: With Bipartisan Vote, Sanders Leads HELP Committee in Historic Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act
Date: July 31, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 31 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led the committee in a bipartisan 20-1 vote to reauthorize, expand, and strengthen the Older Americans Act (OAA) – critical legislation that will substantially increase funding for services for older Americans. This reauthorization marks the second largest authorized funding level increase in the history of the OAA.

“I am very proud that this committee came together – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – to call for a 44% increase in funding for the Older Americans Act over the next five years,” said Sanders. “This legislation begins to pay attention to the urgent unmet needs of millions of seniors in America and what we must do as a society to reduce the senior poverty rate, to reduce senior hunger, and to improve the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in our country. Not only does the Older Americans Act save lives and ease human suffering, it saves money. In fact, it costs less to feed a senior for an entire year through the Older Americans Act than it does for a senior to spend one night in a hospital.”

This legislation would authorize an increase in OAA funding from $2.3 billion this year to $2.76 billion in Fiscal Year 2025 – a 20 percent increase in funding compared to last year, $450 million more in funding.

Over the next five years, this legislation would authorize the Appropriations Committee to spend 44% more on the OAA than it currently does – taking funding levels from $2.3 billion in 2024 to $3.3 billion in 2029 – for a total of $15 billion.

First signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the OAA has provided vital nutrition, social, economic, and health services to millions of vulnerable seniors for nearly six decades.

In America today, 12 million seniors are at risk of going hungry and are worried about not having enough food to eat. Nearly 95% of adults over the age of 60 have a chronic health condition and 80% have two or more chronic conditions like high blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes. More than 11 million older Americans receive critical social and nutrition services from the OAA.

Over 2 million seniors receive nutrition services each year under the OAA.

Due to a lack of funding, roughly four out of five seniors who need a home-delivered or congregate meals do not receive one and many are put on waiting lists that can last for several months. This legislation begins to reverse that trend.

The OAA was last reauthorized in 2020.

BURLINGTON, Vt., July 31 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today issued the following statement on the extreme flooding in Vermont this week:Once again, Vermont has been struck by more flooding, just three weeks after Barre, Plainfield, and other towns were hit on July 10 – and a year to the day after the disastrous flooding of 2023. We are now seeing significant flood damage in St. Johnsbury, Lyndonville, East Burke, Island Pond, Morgan, and other towns, as a result of 5-8 inches of rain falling in a very short period of time.To all homeowners, businesses, and town officials, please know that my office is working with FEMA and other agencies in the federal government to do all that we can to get as much federal assistance into impacted communities as quickly as possible.If anyone has a question as to how best to proceed, please do not hesitate to give my office a ring.As I think most Vermonters know, these devastating floods are directly related to climate change. From flooding across Vermont, to the hottest days on record in many parts of our country and the world, to wildfires out west, climate change is real and causing devastating damage. Clearly, we must work together as a state, a nation, and a planet to cut carbon emissions and transition to a clean energy system that saves our planet and future generations.To help our state receive as much federal financial support as possible, it is important to report the damages that have occurred. Please call 2-1-1 or visitvermont211.orgto report damage and help our state recover together.Let me be frank: Seeing flood after flood after flood is demoralizing. And, personally, seeing some of the damage these floods have caused has been heartbreaking. I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could tell you that this type of extreme weather is not going to happen again. But I can’t. It could happen tomorrow, next month, or five years from now. That is a somber reality we’ve got to deal with.This is tough stuff that we as a state, nation, and world are going to have to address together and boldly.Lastly, I would like to thank the volunteers, town work crews, rescue teams, state and local employees, and fellow Vermonters for the extraordinary work they are doing to keep our communities safe. Your efforts are much appreciated.Once again, if my office can be of any help, please call us at (802) 862-0697. You can also call our toll free number at 1-800-339-9834.

Steward’s bankruptcy has impacted hospitals it owns in 8 states around the country, including in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas

WASHINGTON, July 24 – The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP)announcedlast week that the committee will hold abipartisan votetomorrow, on Thursday, July 25, at 10:00 a.m. ET, to authorize an investigation into the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care and subpoena the company’s CEO.The subpoena would compel Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Steward’s CEO and Chairman, to testify at a hearing on September 12 titled, “Examining the Bankruptcy of Steward Health Care: How Management Decisions Have Impacted Patient Care.”Under Dr. de la Torre’s leadership, Steward Health Care, which owns 31 hospitals in eight states, filed for bankruptcy on May 6 with more than $9 billion in debt. Steward’s financial problems have led to a lack of adequate staffing and supplies, endangering patients. There are also fears that the potential for closures could leave communities without crucial health care services and burden surrounding hospitals. In addition to its financial problems, Steward is the subject of a federal investigation over alleged fraud and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In 2022, Steward also settled False Claims Act violations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, alleging that Steward defrauded the U.S. government and the American taxpayer for medical services that they did not provide.

WASHINGTON, July 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to a joint meeting of Congress this week:As I stated last month, I willnotbe attending the address of Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress on Wednesday.I agree with both the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United Nations independent commission that both Benjamin Netanyahu and Yahya Sinwar are war criminals. Hamas, under Sinwar’s leadership, began this war with a horrific attack against Israel, which killed 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, and took over 240 captives.In response, Netanyahu and his right-wing, extremist government have waged total war against the Palestinian people, killing at least 39,000 Palestinians and injuring 89,000 – sixty percent of whom are women, children, or elderly people. Further, the Netanyahu war machine has made life unlivable in Gaza, destroying the housing stock, the physical infrastructure, and the health care system. Every university has been bombed, and 88 percent of all school buildings have been damaged. And now, because of the ongoing restrictions on humanitarian aid, some 495,000 people face catastrophic levels of food insecurity – in other words, they are starving.No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned. In my view, his right-wing, extremist government should not receive another nickel of U.S. taxpayer support to continue the inhumane destruction of Gaza.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Markey Joint Statement on Upcoming Vote to Investigate and Subpoena Steward Health Care on Bankruptcy

Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 18 – Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Subcommittee Chair Ed Markey (D-Mass.) on Thursday issued the following statement:In America today, we have a dysfunctional and cruel health care system that is designed not to make patients well, but to make executives extraordinarily wealthy.There could not be a clearer example of that than private equity vultures on Wall Street making a fortune by taking over hospitals, stripping their assets, and lining their own pockets.Perhaps more than anyone else in America, Dr. Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health Care, is the poster child for the type of outrageous corporate greed that is permeating through our for-profit health care system.Working with private equity forces, Dr. de la Torre became obscenely wealthy by loading up hospitals from Massachusetts to Arizona with billions in debt and sold the land underneath these hospitals to real estate executives who charge unsustainably high rent.As a result, Steward Health Care, and the more than 30 hospitals it owns in eight states, were forced to declare bankruptcy with some $9 billion in debt.Several of Steward’s hospitals have been forced to close their doors. Others couldn’t pay their health providers or purchase life-saving hospital supplies. Now, communities across the country are grappling with the possibility of losing their local hospitals as a result of Steward’s gross financial mismanagement. Meanwhile, Dr. de la Torre received an estimated $16 million a year in compensation, and Cerberus, the private equity firm that he partnered with, made an $800 million profit.Adding insult to injury, while patients and providers at Steward-owned hospitals suffered and his company careened towards bankruptcy, Dr. de La Torre received an estimated $100 million from his private equity enablers that he used to buy a $40 million yacht and a $15 million luxury fishing boat.That is corporate greed at its most disgusting.Time and time again we have invited Dr. de la Torre to come before Congress to testify about the financial mismanagement at Steward that led to one of the largest health care bankruptcies in our nation’s history. And time and time again, he has arrogantly refused.Enough is enough. It is time for Dr. de la Torre to get off of his yacht and explain to Congress how much he has gained financially while bankrupting the hospitals he manages.Next week, the HELP Committee will vote, on a bipartisan basis, to subpoena Dr. de la Torre and to conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the financial schemes that led to Steward’s bankruptcy. It is time for Congress to hold Dr. de la Torre accountable for his greed.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Releases Report Documenting the Outrageous Level of Corporate Greed at Amazon
Date: July 16, 2024

Content:
Nearly Half of All Amazon Warehouse Workers Are Injured During Prime Day Week

WASHINGTON, July 16 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released aninterim reportyesterday as part of the sweepinginvestigationhe launched into Amazon’s unacceptable corporate greed and abysmal workplace safety practices.

As part of this report, Sanders is making public, for the first time, internal company data showing that almost half of all warehouse workers at Amazon – the second largest corporation in America worth over $2 trillion – suffered injuries during Prime Day week in 2019.

“The incredibly dangerous working conditions at Amazon revealed in this investigation are a perfect example of the type of corporate greed that the American people are sick and tired of,” said Chairman Sanders. “Despite making $36 billion in profits last year and providing its CEO with over $275 million in compensation over the past three years, Amazon continues to treat its workers as disposable and with complete contempt for their safety and wellbeing. That is unacceptable and that has got to change. Amazon must be held accountable for the horrendous working conditions at its warehouses and substantially reduce its injury rates.”

Internal Amazon documents released in this report show that Amazon’s total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. Its rate of “recordable” injuries – injuries the company is required to disclose to OSHA – was more than double the industry average, with over 10 injuries per 100 workers during that same period.

This report draws on the HELP Committee Majority Staff’s interviews with more than 100 Amazon workers over the course of the investigation. It details those workers’ experiences in Amazon’s warehouses, including the pressure they face to meet demand during Prime Day and the holiday season, and demonstrates the company’s blatant disregard for the safety of its workers.

This report outlines how the company’s documented history of medical mismanagement and under-recording of injuries suggest that even this staggeringly high rate of recordable injuries is less than the true number of serious injuries that workers sustain on the job. The report cites OSHA documentation of Amazon’s pattern of providing on-site first aid to injured workers – even seriously injured workers – instead of referring those workers to outside medical providers for needed care. It also notes that OSHA has cited Amazon for failing to properly record injuries based on federal or state record keeping regulations in at least 20 facilities since 2019.

This report also demonstrates that Amazon is aware of an understaffing problem at its warehouses, including during Prime Day – meaning during these periods, workers are expected to work even harder, for longer hours, without the appropriate amount of support for that workload. This understaffing increases the already unacceptable risk of injuries for Amazon workers.

On July 16 and 17 of 2024, Amazon is holding its annualPrime Day event, where it discounts products for Amazon Prime subscribers. The event is a major source of revenue for the company. In 2023, Amazonrecorded$12.7 billion in sales for 375 million products over two days.Read the full interim report,HERE.

Title: NEWS: “We Must Not Forget Gaza,” says Sanders

WASHINGTON, July 12 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and his intention to block arms sales to Israel:While much of the media is focused on the drama of the U.S. presidential election, we must not lose sight of what is happening in Gaza, where an unprecedented humanitarian crisis continues to get even worse.Nine months into this war, more than 38,000 people have been killed and 88,000 injured – 60 percent of whom are women, children, or elderly. The full toll is likely higher, with thousands more buried beneath the rubble.Nine in ten Gazans – 1.9 million people – have been driven from their homes. Many people have been displaced four or five times, and most do not have homes to return to, with more than 60 percent of residential buildings damaged or destroyed.Israel continues to restrict the entry of UN humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, prevent the entry of key humanitarian items, and obstruct aid workers’ access to many areas. These restrictions have prevented aid organizations from setting up a sustained, effective response.The results are catastrophic.Unbelievably, one in four Gazans face starvation, some 495,000 people. The World Food Programme was forced to reduce rations in June, and many people receive only flour. Many people, including children, are sifting through the rubble for food, and boiling leaves for sustenance.In searing heat, clean water is in short supply. Some 67 percent of water and sanitation infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. Children spend many hours each day searching for food or water, picking their way through mountains of garbage or down streets that run with sewage.These conditions have spread dangerous diseases like hepatitis and diarrhea, yet most hospitals and health clinics have been destroyed by the bombardment, and some 500 health care workers killed.Hamas started this war with the horrific terrorist attack on October 7th, which killed 1,200 innocent Israelis and took hundreds of hostages. Israel had a right to respond. But Netanyahu’s extreme right-wing government has waged total war against the entire Palestinian people, without distinction. The Israeli government has ignored international law and made life unlivable in Gaza. That is why Netanyahu faces possible indictment by the International Criminal Court for his actions.Yet, in the midst of this horror and violations of international law, the United States continues to send billions of dollars and thousands of bombs and other weapons to support this war. We, as Americans, are complicit.We must end our support for Netanyahu’s war. Not another nickel to make this horrific situation even worse. I intend to do everything I can to block further arms transfers to Israel, including through joint resolutions of disapproval of any arms sales. The United States must not help a right-wing extremist and war criminal continue this atrocity.

That painful memory was made even worse this week as a number of Vermont communities were hit once again with dangerous floodwaters.While a full assessment of the damage is still being determined, we know that Barre, Plainfield, Lyndonville, Richmond, Williamstown, Bolton, Moretown, and other towns are dealing with the aftermath of some very serious flooding.

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday, July 11 at 10:00 a.m. ET, will lead the committee in a hearing titled, “What Can Congress Do to End the Medical Debt Crisis in America?”

“In the United States of America – the richest country in the history of the world – people should not be going bankrupt or having their wages garnished because they cannot afford to pay outrageous medical bills,” said Chairman Sanders. “We can no longer tolerate a health care system in which 42 percent of cancer patients deplete their life savings within two years of their diagnosis because they are drowning in medical debt. That is unspeakable. No one in America should face financial ruin because of the cost of an unexpected medical emergency or a hospital stay. The time has come to cancel all medical debt and guarantee health care to all as a human right, not a privilege.”

In the U.S. today, more than four in 10 adults report having health care debt, and 12 percent of adults have an outstanding balance of $10,000 or more. Combined, Americans owe $220 billion in medical debt. Cancelling medical debt is overwhelmingly supported by the American public, including 84 percent of Republicans. When asked which types of debt Americans would like to see forgiven, two-thirds of Americans pointed to medical debt.

Medical debt has impacted Americans in every sector of their lives. Over 60 percent of adults with medical debt reported cutting back on food, clothing, or other basic necessities. Over 40 percent of respondents to a survey reported skipping or delaying paying other bills, and nearly 30 percent took money out of retirement or other long-term savings accounts. Nearly 75 percent of adults say they are worried about being able to afford unexpected medical bills.

In May, Chair Sandersintroducedthe Medical Debt Cancellation Act, which would eliminate all $220 billion in medical debt held by millions of Americans, wipe debt from credit reports, and drastically limit the accrual of future medical debt.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday issued the following statement on the right-wing takeover of the United States Supreme Court in its spate of recent decisions:Over the years, among other disastrous rulings, this right-wing court has given usCitizens United, which created a corrupt, billionaire dominated political system. It overturnedRoe v. Wade, removing women’s constitutional right to control their own bodies. Last week, the Court chose to criminalize poverty by banning homeless encampments in public spaces – forcing more poor people into the cycle of debt and poverty. With theChevroncase, they have made it far more difficult for the government to address the enormous crises we face in terms of climate change, public health, workers’ rights, and many other areas. And, today, the Court ruled in favor of broad presidential immunity, making it easier for Trump and other politicians to break the law without accountability.These are just some of the dangerous rulings from a right-wing, corporate-sponsored Supreme Court that continues to serve an extremist agenda. If these conservative justices want to make public policy, they should simply quit the Supreme Court and run for political office.At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, billionaire control of our political system, and major threats to the foundations of American democracy, it is clear to me that we need real Supreme Court reform. A strong, enforceable code of ethics is a start, but just a start. We’ll need much more than that.

Title: NEWS: New GAO Report Finds Millions of Seniors Are Not Getting the Meals and Home Care They Need
Date: June 25, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 25 – According to a new report on the unmet needs of seniors across the United States, four out of five seniors who needed a home-delivered or congregate meal in 2021 did not receive one; and over 3.6 million, or 18 percent, of low-income older adults were food insecure.Commissioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), and released last week by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the report comes as Sanders is working to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA), which has provided essential nutrition, social, economic, and health services to millions of vulnerable seniors for nearly six decades. First signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, the OAA was last reauthorized in 2020 and will expire on September 30, 2024.The GAO report also found that more than one in four seniors, about 18.9 million Americans, have difficulty with at least one activity or instrumental activity of daily living, such as shopping, housework, dressing, or bathing. Sixty percent of older adults who struggle with one or two activities of daily living were not receiving any help in 2020 – up from 47 percent in 2012.“It is unacceptable that in the richest country in the history of the world, so many seniors are struggling to get by, too often going without the care and nutrition they need,”said Chairman Sanders.“The good news is that we have a very effective piece of legislation on the books to address the urgent unmet needs of vulnerable seniors: the Older Americans Act. The bad news is that funding for critical nutrition and home care services provided through the Older Americans Act has not kept pace with inflation or the growing senior population. It is time for that to change. These services not only save lives, ease human suffering, and improve the quality of life for seniors, they save money. It is time for Congress to substantially increase funding for the Older Americans Act.”According to ananalysisof Medicare claims, receiving home-delivered meals is associated with a 31 percent reduction in hospitalizations, 25 percent reduction in nursing home use, and 13 percent reduction in emergency department use. Older adults who receive a congregate meal are less likely to be admitted to a hospital or have an emergency department visit than those who do not receive a meal.Nutrition programs established by the OAA are able to feed a senior for an entire year for the same cost as one night in the hospital. Malnutrition among seniors costs the U.S. over $50 billion each and every year. OAA-funded prevention programs have also been estimated to reduce the number of falls by seniors by up to 55 percent and reduce annual health costs by up to over $900 per participant. Falls by older Americans – which often take place during basic daily activities – result in $50 billion in medical costs each year, the majority of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid.In March, Sanders led the HELP Committee in ahearingon the OAA and in May he led 38 senators in aletterto the Senate Appropriations Committee requesting to double funding for the OAA, to $4.6 billion, in Fiscal Year 2025.Read the full report,here.

Title: NEWS: New Report on the Coordinated Effort by Billionaires to Dismantle the American Public School System
Date: June 25, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) today released a new report detailing the coordinated and growing effort to undermine, dismantle, and privatize the American public education system. This report comes after Sanders led the committee in ahearinglast week titled, “The Immediate and Long-Term Challenges Facing Public School Teachers: Low, Pay, Teacher Shortages, and Underfunded Public Schools.”Written by the HELP Committee’s Majority Staff, the report focuses on the impact of school privatization policies in the form of private school vouchers, which harm public schools, fuel education segregation, largely benefit wealthy families, and provide tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations.According to the report’s new analysis, over the past decade, state funding for the nation’s public elementary and secondary schools has barely increased, by an average of just 1 percent a year after adjusting for inflation. During this same time, state spending on tax breaks and subsidies for private schools has skyrocketed by 408 percent, or $7 billion. These costs do not include 9 states that recently enacted, but have not fully implemented, their universal private school voucher policies – which will likely cause costs to further spike in coming years.“Over the past decade, there has been a coordinated effort on the part of right-wing billionaires to undermine, dismantle and sabotage our nation’s public schools and to privatize our education system,”said Chairman Sanders.“That is absolutely unacceptable. We can no longer tolerate billionaires and multi-national corporations receiving massive tax breaks and subsidies while children in America are forced to go to under-staffed, under-resourced, and under-funded public schools. On this 70th anniversary year of Brown v. Board of Education, let us recommit to creating an education system that works for all of our people, not just the wealthy few.”The American public K-12 school system serves about 91 percent of students across the country and employs 3.5 million teachers. Funded through taxpayer dollars, the system relies on 44 percent local funding, 46 percent state funding, and only 10 percent in federal funding. However, in the last three years, an unprecedented number of states with Republican-led legislatures have expanded their private school voucher programs, draining hundreds of millions of dollars from state budgets and public education systems to fund private schools.One example the report examines is Arizona. In 2022, Arizona passed the nation’s first universal-eligibility private school voucher program. Originally forecasted to cost $65 million in Fiscal Year 2024, the state later warned that the program could cost $944 million annually, subsidizing many students who never attended public schools to begin with. This could result in a $320 million gap in the overall state budget. While 92 percent of Arizona’s students are enrolled in public school, less than half of new K-12 education spending in the state’s FY24 budget would go towards public education. With the money it spends on private school vouchers, Arizona could hire 15,730 more public school teachers and pay them at least $60,000 a year.Some additional findings from the report include:

As Chairman of the HELP Committee, Sanders has introduced legislation that would address the teacher shortage across the U.S. and substantially increase funding for public schools in high-poverty districts. ThePay Teachers Actensures all public school teachers earn at least $60,000 a year with increases over the course of their career, and would triple funding for Title I – the major federal program that provides resources to low-income school districts. Sanders has also introducedlegislationto make public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt free and to cancel all student debt.Read the full report,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces CEO of Novo Nordisk to Testify Before HELP Committee By Himself onSeptember 24
Date: June 24, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), announced today that Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen will be testifying before the committee on Tuesday, September 24 at 10 a.m. ET. The hearing will focus on the outrageously high prices that Novo Nordisk charges Americans for their blockbuster drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy.

“I look forward to the CEO of Novo Nordisk testifying before the HELP Committee on the outrageously high costs of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States,”said Chairman Sanders.“The American people are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Novo Nordisk currently charges Americans with Type 2 diabetes $969 a month for Ozempic, while this same exact drug can be purchased for just $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and just $59 in Germany. Incredibly, Novo Nordisk also charges Americans with obesity $1,349 a month for Wegovy, while this same exact product can be purchased for just $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. The Committee looks forward to Mr. Jørgensen answering a very simple question: Why does he think it’s acceptable to charge Americans up to 10 or 15 times more for Ozempic and Wegovy than people in Europe and other major countries?”

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Bowman, Markey Introduce Legislation to Combat Corporate Greed and Windfall Profits
Date: June 21, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 21 – Amid record-breaking corporate profits and unprecedented corporate greed, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced he will soon introduce legislation that would impose a 95 percent windfall tax on the excessive profits of large corporations that are using inflation as an excuse to charge the American people outrageous prices on the products they sell. Had this legislation, the Ending Corporate Greed Act, been in effect in 2023, it would have raised an estimated $300 billion in one year from ten of the largest corporations alone.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined Sanders on the legislation in the Senate and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (D-N.Y.) today introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

This would not be the first time the United States implemented a windfall profits tax. Sanders’ legislation is modeled after the windfall profits tax implemented by the United States during the first and second World Wars and the Korean War. During World War II, the tax rate reached 95 percent, which ensured that companies could not engage in war profiteering. The U.S. also enacted a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies as recently as the mid-1980s.

“The American people are sick and tired of being ripped-off by large corporations that continue to make record-breaking profits by charging outrageously high prices for gas, rent, food, and prescription drugs,”said Sanders.“Enough is enough. We cannot continue to allow large corporations to make obscene profits by price gouging Americans in virtually every sector of our economy. If corporate CEOs and their masters on Wall Street will not end their greed, we must end it for them. It is time for Congress to enact a windfall profits tax.”

“Since the pandemic, corporations have remained incredibly selfish in their business practices, squeezing their consumers who rely on them for essential goods and services, including gas, food, prescription drugs, banking and more,”said Bowman.“As corporations continue to make massive profits off the backs of rank-and-file workers, wages aren’t keeping pace. As a result the American people are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of living. Congress must do its part to check corporate greed before it completely robs people in America of their ability to live a life in pursuit of liberty, justice and happiness. As billionaires and corporations continue to get richer while the average person struggles to afford gas, food and utility costs–we must begin to hold those responsible to account and take the necessary steps to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”

“Corporate greed and unconscionable price gouging have resulted in Americans paying more for basic necessities such as gas and groceries,”said Markey.“The Ending Corporate Greed Act penalizes large corporations raking in record profits while everyday Americans and workers pay the price.”

Last year, corporate profits hit a record high with a reported profit of $2.8 trillion after taxes. Today, corporate profit margins are at their highest rate since the 1950s. Meanwhile, rising prices have continued to sap workers’ paychecks with inflation hitting 4.1 percent last year – with corporate profits driving more than half of the rise in inflation during the second and third quarters of 2023. Americans have taken notice of this greed – a recent poll showed that 84 percent of all respondents said they believe “corporations being greedy and raising prices to make record profits” is a major driver of inflation.

If signed into law, Sanders’ Ending Corporate Greed Act would:

Under this legislation, even with the 95 percent windfall profits tax, companies would still be able to make a reasonable profit compared to previous years. Additionally, as the tax is on profit, not revenue, companies that raise prices for legitimate reasons related to rising expenses would not be penalized. However, companies that have chosen to raise prices in the pursuit of obscene profiteering, to further enrich their CEOs and wealthy shareholders, would pay a tax of up to 95 percent on their windfall profits.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Leads HELP Committee Hearing on the Crises Facing Public School Teachers in America
Date: June 20, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), today led the committee in ahearingtitled, “The Immediate and Long-Term Challenges Facing Public School Teachers: Low, Pay, Teacher Shortages, and Underfunded Public Schools.”Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedHERE:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.

In a moment, we will hear directly from educators from across the country about the enormous effort it takes to provide a quality public education for every child in our country.

In my view, if we are serious about the need for a bright and hopeful future for America, we must understand that there is no more important job in our country than educating our young people.

And yet, for decades, public school teachers have been overworked, underpaid and under-staffed.

Compared to many other occupations, our public school teachers are more likely to experience higher levels of anxiety, stress and burnout – which was only exacerbated by the pandemic.

As a result, nearly 8 percent of teachers leave their profession each and every year – double the rate of Canada and many other countries.

According to the most recent statistics, some 300,000 teaching positions—nearly 10% of all teaching positions nationwide—have been left vacant or filled by teachers not fully certified for their assignments.

In addition, teacher turnover rates are 50 percent higher in school districts with high poverty rates than districts that serve wealthier students.

Incredibly, 44% of public school teachers are now quitting their profession within 5 years.

Why is that?  Why are so many public school teachers leaving the profession they love in droves?

Why do we have a massive shortage of teachers in America?

Well, there are many reasons.  But one of the primary reasons is the extremely low pay teachers receive.

According to the most recent statistics, the average starting teacher salary in America is less than $45,000 a year and nearly 40 percent of school districts in our country pay teachers a starting salary of less than $40,000 a year.

Incredibly, the average public school teacher in America is making nearly $100 a week less than he or she did 28 years ago after adjusting for inflation.

Wages for public school teachers are so low that in 36 states throughout America, the average public school teacher with a family of four qualifies for food stamps, public housing or other government benefits.

In America today, nearly 20 percent of public school teachers in our country are forced to work two or three jobs during the school year.  Maybe they are driving an Uber. Maybe they are waiting tables.  Maybe they are parking cars.  In the richest country in the history of the world, we have got to do better than that.

Meanwhile, because of a lack of resources, about 80 percent of public school teachers are forced to spend their own money on classroom supplies without being reimbursed – which comes out to about 13 percent of their first monthly paycheck.

The situation has become so absurd that 4 hedge fund managers on Wall Street made more money last year than every kindergarten teacher in America – nearly 120,000 teachers. That should not be happening in the United States of America in the year 2024.

Public school teachers should not be forced to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet.

They should not be forced to apply for food stamps or public housing because they are not paid enough to feed their families or put a roof over their heads.

Further, as bad as public school teachers are paid, our nation’s school custodians, food service workers, and other school staff earn even less.

In America today, nearly 40 percent of support staff in our public schools earn less than $25,000 a year.

If we are going to attract the best and brightest young people into teaching, if we are going to encourage teachers to teach in underserved communities, if we are going to improve teacher retention and morale, and if we are going to improve student academic outcomes, then, in my view, we need to pay teachers in America decent wages and decent benefits.

And that is why I introduced the Pay Teachers Act with nine of my colleagues this Congress.

This bill would make sure that no teacher in America is paid less than $60,000 a year.

It would increase wages for teachers that have made teaching their profession – those who have been on the job for 10, 20, 30 years.

It would triple Title I funding – the major federal program that targets resources to high-poverty school districts.

It would invest in federal programs that provide teachers with the training, education and preparation they need to succeed.And it would benefit every public school district in every state in America.

Now, here is the good news.

As a result of local organizing, led by public school teachers, some states are beginning to do the right thing.In recent years, the state of New Mexico has increased teacher pay by an average of 20 percent.The State of Maryland recently became the first state in the country to require all teachers to be paid a competitive salary that is at least $60,000 a year by July of 2026.The State of Arkansas recently increased minimum teacher salaries from $36,000 a year to $50,000 and provided a minimum $2,000 raise for all teachers during the 2023-2024 academic year.And the State of Mississippi recently increased teacher pay by 11 percent.Raising teacher salaries to at least $60,000 a year and ensuring competitive pay for all of our teachers is one of the most important steps we can take to address the teacher shortage in America and to improve the quality of our public school system in our country.Bottom line is everybody knows the young people are our future. And we have got to deal with the reality that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost every major nation on earth and we are not attracting, because of inadequate salaries, the kinds of people we need into teaching. So let me just conclude by thanking the hundreds of thousands of teachers in this country. You are heroes. You are heroines. You are doing enormously important work. You are saving children’s lives every single day and I thank you very much for what you do.Senator Cassidy, you are now recognized for an opening statement.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Responds to Netanyahu’s Calls for More U.S. Weapons: “No More Bombs for Netanyahu”
Date: June 18, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 18 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement in response to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s claims that the United States should be supplying Israel with additional weapons and ammunitions in its war against Gaza:

Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu put out a video attacking the United States for not sending him bombs fast enough. No doubt, we will hear similar complaints when he addresses Congress on July 24.

Virtually everyone recognizes Israel’s right to defend itself from terrorism and respond to the horrific October 7th Hamas attack that killed 1,200 innocent Israelis and took hundreds of hostages. But the Israeli government did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people. Yet that is exactly what has happened.

Let’s be clear: the right wing, extremist Netanyahu government has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians and injured nearly 85,000, sixty percent of whom are women, children, or elderly.

After displacing nearly 1.8 million people from their homes, it has damaged or destroyed more than 60 percent of the housing stock in Gaza.

It has devastated the civilian infrastructure, including water and sewage systems. Today, despite extraordinarily high temperatures, there is virtually no electricity in Gaza.

The health care system has been decimated, with 19 hospitals knocked out of service and more than 400 healthcare workers killed.

The education system has also been devastated – 88 percent of all school buildings have sustained damage, and all twelve of Gaza’s universities have been bombed, leaving 625,000 students with no access to education.

According to humanitarian organizations, hundreds of thousands of people face possible famine. Already, more than 8,000 children under the age of five have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition, the result of the Netanyahu government’s restrictions on humanitarian aid.

Given all of this, it is easy to understand why Netanyahu is credibly accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. He is beholden to extreme racists in Israel and has devoted his career to undermining the prospects for a two-state solution and lasting peace.

It is absurd that Netanyahu has been invited to address Congress. We should not be honoring people who use the starvation of children as a weapon of war. Instead, the United States should be withholding all offensive military aid to Israel and using our leverage to demand an end to this war, the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, a stop to the killing of Palestinians in the West Bank, and initial steps towards a two-state solution.

In the 2022-2023 school year, the average starting teacher salary was $44,530. While salaries vary across and within states, a 2020 study found that the average public-school teacher with a family of four qualifies for food stamps, public housing, and other government assistance programs in at least 38 states. Approximately8 percentof teachers leave the profession every year, double the rate of Finland, Singapore, and Canada. Within five years, that number jumps to44 percent.Last year, Sandersintroducedthe Pay Teacher Act, legislation that would begin to address the major teacher pay crisis in America, triple Title I funding, and ensure that all public school teachers earn a livable and competitive wage that is at least $60,000 a year and will continue to increase over the course of their careers.DetailsWhat:Senate HELP Committee Hearing titled, “The Immediate and Long-Term Challenges Facing Public School Teachers: Low Pay, Teacher Shortages, and Underfunded Public Schools”When:Thursday, June 20, 9:00 a.m. ETWhere:Room 562, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Developments in the West Bank
Date: June 14, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement regarding the ongoing state-backed settler violence, deepening occupation, and violations of U.S. and international law taking place in the West Bank:While the world is understandably focused on the destruction unfolding in Gaza, we should not lose sight of what is happening in the West Bank – actions which are in violation of both American and international law.Since October 7th, more than 500 Palestinians, including 100 children, have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli security forces and settlers. Israeli settlers, acting as vigilantes, have killed unarmed people and forced Palestinians off their land, burning homes and businesses. Israeli authorities do little to stop the violence and almost never seriously investigate these crimes.In fact, the current extremist Israeli government is dedicated to deepening the occupation and undermining the prospects for two-state solution. The founding charter of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Likud Party says that “between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” Netanyahu has systematically pursued that goal, overseeing record settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree legally belong to Palestinians.Today, Netanyahu is beholden to figures even more extreme than he is. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the police, has long advocated for the forcible expulsion of Palestinians. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, responsible for administering the West Bank, has likewise expressed racist views and called for the expulsion of Palestinians. As a young man, he was arrested by Israeli authorities on terrorism charges. Since October 7th, Smotrich has denied the Palestinian Authority access to its tax revenues and imposed sweeping restrictions on Palestinian movement, creating a desperate economic crisis and deepening instability.Let’s be clear: the right-wing, extremist Netanyahu government is not only breaking international law in Gaza, they are doing the same in the West Bank, where they are pursuing illegal annexation by force. Netanyahu should be facing serious consequences for these violations, not receiving an invitation to address a joint session of Congress.

WASHINGTON, June 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), announced today that Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen has reconsidered his position and has agreed to testify voluntarily on a solo panel before the Committee. The hearing will focus on the outrageously high prices that Novo Nordisk charges Americans for their blockbuster drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. The hearing will be held in early September.

“I enjoyed the opportunity of chatting with Mr. Jørgensen this afternoon and thank him for agreeing to voluntarily testify on a solo panel before the HELP Committee on the high cost of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States,” said Sanders. “The scheduled subpoena vote is no longer necessary and will be cancelled.”

Sanders continued: “The American people are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Novo Nordisk currently charges Americans with Type 2 diabetes $969 a month for Ozempic, while this same exact drug can be purchased for just $155 in Canada and just $59 in Germany. Novo Nordisk also charges Americans with obesity $1,349 a month for Wegovy, while this same exact product can be purchased for just $140 in Germany and $92 in the United Kingdom.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and 31 Senators Call on National Mediation Board to End Delays and Allow Airline Workers to Strike If Agreements Can’t Be Reached
Date: June 12, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
“These workers were on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and were instrumental in saving the airline industry from collapse, but now, in some cases, find themselves working for pre-pandemic wage levels. They deserve better.”
WASHINGTON, June 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today, with 31 of his colleagues in the Senate, called on the National Mediation Board (NMB) to urgently resolve unfairly delayed contract negotiations that have left more than 100,000 flight attendants and airline workers stuck in expired contracts without the ability to strike – all while cost-of-living expenses are on the rise and airline carriers rake in record-breaking profits.

“We are concerned about the increasing number of contract negotiations before the NMB that are being unnecessarily drawn out at the expense of workers,”wrote the senators.“We understand that there are ongoing negotiations that have dragged on for as long as five years and we have heard from workers who are rightfully frustrated that they are being subjected to unfair delays in bargaining. Without new contracts, these workers are left further and further behind…”

Thesenators continued:“In particular, over 100,000 flight attendants have recently been or currently are stuck in contract negotiations with many working under contracts that expired several years ago. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of flight attendants around the world rallied to demand fair contracts from six airlines. These workers were on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and were instrumental in saving the airline industry from collapse, but now, in some cases, find themselves working for pre-pandemic wage levels. They deserve better.”

Under federal law, flight attendants, rail workers, and others in the transportation industry are not legally permitted to go on strike without an authorizing vote by the NMB. Since 2006, airline workers have only been permitted to strike twice, the last of which was 14 years ago during the Spirit Airlines Pilot strike of 2010. However, the NMB permitted dozens of strikes during the 1980s and 1990s.

“Unfortunately, it seems airline carriers do not feel pressured to reach agreements quickly, likely because the flight attendants’ ability to strike has rarely been allowed to be exercised…”concluded the senators.“We are concerned that this fact has contributed to the present pattern of unending negotiations and that many carriers are taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, we join with our 178 colleagues in the House to urge the Board to use all of the tools at your disposal, including releasing parties from mediation as necessary, to resolve these long-pending contract negotiations.”

Sanders was joined on the letter by 31 of his colleagues in the Senate including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

“When negotiations drag on for three to more than five years it’s clearly time to call the question,”said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing nearly 55,000 Flight Attendants at 20 airlines.“Airline executives have believed they have a free pass to delay conclusion of negotiations, while richly rewarding themselves. No more! Flight Attendants and other aviation workers are ready to back up demands for long overdue record contracts. The strike is not the goal, but it is the means in these situations to get real on getting a deal. Thanks to Senator Sanders for coordinating this Senate letter that simply calls on the National Mediation Board to utilize workers’ right to strike in the Railway Labor Act to conclude these disputes and get workers relief with contracts we can ratify.”

“Contract negotiations must have reasonable deadlines in order for both parties to be motivated to reach an agreement,”Julie Hedrick, National President, Association of Professional Flight Attendants, representing 28,000 American Airlines Flight Attendants.“APFA thanks Senator Bernie Sanders for leading this letter to the National Mediation Board that says exactly that. It’s been five years since APFA members worked under an updated contract and our members are not able to wait any longer. Thank you to the 32 Senators who joined in backing this message in support of improving wages and working conditions for hardworking Flight Attendants.”

Today, there are 4.6 million young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who are out of school and unemployed. More than one-third of these young people live below the poverty line. Advancements in technology have also replaced too many job opportunities for workers. One estimate shows that current shifts toward automation could put 39 million Americans out of work by 2030. It is essential that investments are made to provide opportunities, training, education, and resources to strengthen and expand the U.S. workforce and economy.First passed into law in 2014 with a bipartisan majority, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was established to expand high-quality employment opportunities for workers across the country through education, training, and support services.

The letter comes ahead of the G20 meetings this July during which Brazil, the current president of the G20, willreportedlypush for a joint declaration on the initiative. The proposal has already gained provisionalsupportfrom leading economists, global civil leaders, and a number of countries, including France.“We write to urge your administration to support an important initiative at the G20 to foster international cooperation on taxation of ultrawealthy individuals,” wrote the members. “This is a historic opportunity for the United States to provide global leadership on tax fairness and also strengthen the administration’s vital domestic efforts to achieve a fairer tax system…We encourage your administration to join others in pledging support for this effort, and to help lead the G20 to a historic agreement that will secure a more equitable U.S. and global economy.”In recent decades, the richest 1% of earners in the G20 have seen their top tax rates fall by roughly a third, while their share of national income increased by 45%,accordingto Oxfam. Over the next decade, countries around the worldcould loseup to $4.8 trillion in tax revenue due to tax havens, according to a 2023 study by advocacy group Tax Justice Network. Exposés such as the Panama Papers Leak, the Paradise Papers, and ProPublica’s IRS filesinvestigationcontinue to bring to light the pervasiveness of the ultrawealthy gaming the system, both in the U.S. and across the globe, to avoid paying their fair share in taxes.“Every tax dollar not paid by a billionaire could have been used to invest in our communities, address climate change, and support public goods – from education to health care to infrastructure – that are critical to prosperity and a strong economy,” wrote the members.Brazil’s G20 proposal presents an unprecedented opportunity for much-needed international cooperation to address the global failure to tax the ultrawealthy, depriving governments and communities of resources and contributing to extreme concentrations of wealth. This proposal – which focuses on individual taxation – builds on the meaningful advances made by the landmark 2021 agreement by more than 130 countries on a global framework for corporate taxation.The letter argues that support for the initiative from the Biden Administration would not only strengthen America’s global leadership on any number of intersecting issues, but also help the administration’s domestic efforts to achieve a fairer tax system at home – including Biden’s plan for a 25% minimum income tax on the ultrawealthy.Sanders and Omar are joined on this letter by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and 13 members in the House. It is endorsed by a number of leading organizations and academics, including: AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Americans for Tax Fairness, Community Change, Groundwork Collaborative, Oxfam America, Patriotic Millionaires, Public Citizen, and Take on Wall Street.Professor Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Economics Prize Laureate, said: “Backing Brazil’s G20 initiative would go a long way to supporting President Biden and Secretary Yellen’s efforts to tax the ultra-rich and reduce today’s extreme levels of inequality. Making sure that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes and setting global minimum standards across countries will make it harder for the ultra-rich to hide their money and enable the U.S. and other countries to raise billions of dollars to combat inequality.”Read full letterhere.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Floor Speech on Subpoena Vote for Novo Nordisk to Testify on Ozempic and Wegovy Prices

“The American people are sick and tired of being ripped off by giant pharmaceutical companies,” said Sanders
WASHINGTON, June 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), today spoke on the floor of the Senate about the outrageous costs major pharmaceutical companies charge for prescription drugs in the United States, including Novo Nordisk which charges the American people up to 10 to 15 times more for Ozempic and Wegovy compared to people in other countries.

Earlier today, Chairman Sandersannouncedthe HELP Committee will, on Tuesday, June 18, vote to subpoena the President of Novo Nordisk Inc. to explain why the company’s prices are so high in the U.S.

Sanders remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

M. President: Let me be as clear as I can be: The American people – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

The American people are sick and tired of being ripped off by giant pharmaceutical companies who make huge profits every year while charging us outrageous prices.

A few months ago, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP Committee) held a hearing on the outrageous price of prescription drugs in the United States and this is what we learned.

We found out that Merck, a pharmaceutical company that made $14.5 billion in profits last year, charges Americans struggling with diabetes $6,900 for (Jan-ooo-vee-ah) Januvia when that same exact product can be purchased in Canada for $900 and just $200 in France.

We found out that this same company (which could afford to spend $7 billion last year on dividends and a $52 million compensation package for its CEO) charges Americans struggling with cancer $191,000 for (Cay-True-Da) Keytruda while this exact same drug can be purchased in Canada for $112,000, $91,000 in France and just $89,000 in Germany.

And it’s not just Merck.

Our committee also discovered that Bristol Myers Squibb, a company that made over $6 billion in profits last year, charges patients in America $7,100 for (El-i-kwis) Eliquis, the popular blood thinner, when that same exact product can be purchased for just $900 in Canada and just $650 in France.

That same company (which, by the way, could afford to spend some $14 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and hand out a $41 million compensation package to its CEO last year) charges Americans with cancer $192,000 for (Op-Dee-Vough) Opdivo while that same exact drug can be purchased for just $89,000 in Canada and $68,000 in France.

What else did we learn?

Well, we found out that Johnson & Johnson (which made over $18 billion in profits last year) charges cancer patients $204,000 for Imbruvica which can be purchased for just $46,000 in the U.K. and $43,000 in France.

And that same company which recently spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and gave its CEO a $27 million compensation package last year, charges Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara when it can be purchased for just $30,000 in Germany and $16,000 in the United Kingdom.

And M. President, let’s be clear.

It’s not just Bristol Myers Squibb.  It’s not just Merck.  It’s not just Johnson & Johnson.

Incredibly, while one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe, ten top pharmaceutical companies in America made over $110 billion in profits last year and spent tens of billions of dollars on stock buybacks and dividends.

As the Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee one of my top priorities is to try to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America.

And one of the ways to do that is to hold the executives of some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in our country accountable for their actions.

Which brings us to another major pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.

M. President: on April 24th, the HELP Committee launched an investigation into the outrageously high prices Novo Nordisk charges for Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States that millions of Americans struggling with diabetes and obesity desperately need.

To date, this investigation has found that:

Novo Nordisk charges Americans with type 2 diabetes $969 a month for Ozempic, while this same exact drug can be purchased for just $59 in Germany, $122 in Denmark and $155 in Canada.

Novo Nordisk charges Americans with obesity $1,349 a month for Wegovy, while this same exact product can be purchased for just $92 in the United Kingdom, $186 in Denmark and $265 in Canada.

Further, if half of the adults in our country with obesity took Wegovy and the other new weight loss drugs, it could cost, and this is really quite incredible, $411 billion per year—$5 billion more than what Americans spent on all prescription drugs at the pharmacy counter in 2022.  Let me repeat: If we do not change this scenario Americans could be spending more, at these outrageous prices, on weight loss drugs than on all prescription drugs at the pharmacy counter.  Clearly, this is unsustainable.

The HELP Committee also found that if half of all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who are obese took Wegovy and other weight loss drugs, Medicare and Medicaid could spend $166 billion per year—roughly what these two major health programs spent on all retail prescription drugs in 2022.  That would also be unsustainable.

M. President: The scientists at Novo Nordisk and the other drug companies deserve a lot of credit and thanks for developing these important life saving drugs.  But these drugs mean nothing to the millions of people who cannot afford them and if we don’t lower their prices they will have a disastrous impact on the federal deficit and the future of Medicare and Medicaid.

In other words, we have a moral responsibility to make sure that every American with diabetes and obesity who receives a prescription for Ozempic or Wegovy can afford to purchase those drugs.

And we have a fiscal responsibility to make sure that Ozempic and Wegovy do not bankrupt Medicare, Medicaid and our entire health care system.

And M. President, that is why the HELP Committee has, time and time again, invited Novo Nordisk to voluntarily testify about the unconscionably high prices they are charging for these drugs in the United States.

And the reason why we invited the executives at Novo Nordisk to testify before Congress is not that complicated.

We want them to answer a very simple question:

Why do they think it is acceptable for Novo Nordisk to charge Americans $969 for Ozempic when that same exact drug can be purchased for just $59 in Germany, $122 in Denmark and $155 in Canada.

We want to ask them why they think it is acceptable to charge Americans $1,349 for Wegovy when that same drug can be purchased for just $92 in the United Kingdom, $186 in Denmark and $265 in Canada.

So, M. President, what are we trying to accomplish?

It’s obvious.  It’s simple.  We want Novo Nordisk to stop ripping-off the American people and charging us prices that are far higher than they charge in other countries.  That’s what I want to see.  That’s what the American people want to see.

Unfortunately, despite all of the discussions that I and my staff have had with Novo Nordisk over the past several months, I must confess that we have made virtually no progress.

We have asked the leadership of the company to come before the Committee to explain why their prices are so high in the United States.  They have not agreed to that.

Therefore, the HELP Committee has no choice but to subpoena the leadership of Novo Nordisk to testify and explain their actions.

I look forward to their presence at a HELP Committee hearing on this issue on July 10th.

M. President, let me be very clear: The HELP Committee that I chair will continue to ask the tough questions that the pharmaceutical industry would like us to ignore.

Why is it that the median price of new prescription drugs in America is now over $300,000 – including many new cancer drugs?

Why has the pharmaceutical industry spent, over the past 25 years, some $8.5 billion on lobbying and over $700 million on campaign contributions?

Why is the pharmaceutical industry spending tens of millions of dollars today on some 1,800 well-paid lobbyists in Washington, DC – including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties?

How does it happen that while millions of Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, major drug companies in America spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development?

These are very simple and straightforward questions that are on the minds of millions of Americans, and these are questions that the executives of major pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to answer.

Now, here is the good news.

As a result of the actions of the HELP Committee, the President and the Democratic Caucus we are beginning to make some progress.

As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act that passed Congress without a single Republican vote, seniors with diabetes are paying no more than $35 a month for insulin.

Starting in January, no senior in America will pay over $2,000 a year for prescription drugs.

And, for the first time in history, Medicare is now doing what every other major country does: Negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of some of the most expensive drugs in America.

Further, working with some of the largest drug companies in the world, the HELP Committee that I chair has managed this month to lower the cost of inhalers that millions of Americans with asthma and COPD need to breathe from as much as $645 down to just $35.

As important as these achievements are much more needs to be done to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.

What does that mean?

It means that, at a time when many Americans are dealing with a myriad of chronic illnesses, President Biden was right when he called on Congress in his State of the Union Address to pass legislation to make sure that no American pays over $2,000 a year for the prescription drugs they need, not just seniors.

He was also right to call on Congress to expand the number of prescription drugs up for price negotiation to at least 50 a year.

But, M. President, let’s be clear.  It’s not just Congress that needs to act.

Prescription drug companies must also step up to the plate and stop ripping-off the American people.

And, in my view, there is no better place to begin that process than with Novo Nordisk.

This is a company that made over $12 billion in profits last year.

This is a company that charges Americans over $1,000 a month for a prescription drug that can be profitably manufactured for less than $5 and can be purchased for as little as $92 in Europe.

M. President: That is not making a reasonable return on investment.  That is price gouging.  That is corporate greed.

It is time for Novo Nordisk to substantially reduce the price of Ozempic and Wegovy.

It is time for Novo Nordisk to end their greed.

And if Novo Nordisk does not end its greed, we have a responsibility to end it for them.

I thank the president and I yield the floor.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Invitation to Netanyahu to Speak Before Joint Meeting of Congress
Date: June 1, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 1 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on the decision of Senate and House leaders of both political parties to extend an invitation to Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to address a joint meeting of Congress:

It is a very sad day for our country that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been invited – by leaders from both parties – to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.

Israel, of course, had the right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of October 7th, but it did not, and does not, have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people. Israel does not have the right to kill more than 34,000 civilians and wound over 80,000 – 5% of the population of Gaza. It does not have the right to orphan 19,000 children. It does not have the right to displace 75% of the people of Gaza from their homes. It does not have the right to damage or destroy over 60% of the housing in Gaza. It does not have the right to destroy the civilian infrastructure of Gaza, to obliterate water and sewage systems, and deny electricity to the people of Gaza. It does not have the right to annihilate Gaza’s health care system, knocking 26 hospitals out of service and killing more than 400 health care workers. It does not have the right to bomb all 12 of Gaza’s universities and 56 of its schools, or deny 625,000 children in Gaza the opportunity for an education.

It most certainly does not have the right to block humanitarian aid – food and medical supplies – from coming in to the desperate people of Gaza, creating the conditions for starvation and famine. It does not have the right to condemn hundreds of thousands of children to death by starvation. This is a clear violation of American and international law.

The International Criminal Court recently announced that it is seeking warrants for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, and Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas. The ICC is right. Both of these people are engaged in clear and outrageous violations of international law.

Benjamin Netanyahu is a war criminal. He should not be invited to address a joint meeting of Congress. I certainly will not attend.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Sanders and Murray Announce HELP Hearing on Devastation Caused by Republican Abortion Bans Two Years Post-Dobbs
Date: May 29, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 29 – Today, U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), former HELP Committee Chair, announced that the Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday, June 4 at 10:00 a.m. ET on the tremendous harm, chaos, and heartbreak that theDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organizationdecision and Republican abortion bans have created in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. Murray will chair the hearing, titled “The Assault on Women’s Freedoms: How Abortion Bans Have Created a Health Care Nightmare Across America.”“In the two years since Roe was overturned, Republican abortion bans have created a full-blown health care crisis — forcing providers to close their doors and shut down their practices, putting women’s lives in danger, decimating access to maternal health care, and forcing women to remain pregnant, no matter their circumstances,”said Sanders and Murray.“The Dobbs decision and Republican abortion bans have forced women to leave their states under duress or wait until they are near-death to receive care. Providers have been forced to make gut-wrenching decisions about whether to risk jail time to help a women access the health care she needs. The harm of Dobbs has extended far beyond states with extreme abortion bans. In places where abortion remains legal, women are waiting longer for care and providers are struggling to keep up with a dramatically increased patient load.“The threats to a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body and her future keep coming — right now Republicans are working to rip away access to safe medication abortion, block women from receiving emergency abortion care that could save their lives, ban abortion nationwide, and restrict access to contraception. And Republican attacks on basic health care are only escalating. The anti-abortion movement has shown its cruelty and utter disregard for women’s lives again and again, and it is essential that we use every opportunity to continue to make clear exactly how extreme right-wing abortion bans and restrictions on reproductive health care have endangered women, hurt families, and rolled back rights.“We must continue to shine a light on the living nightmare extreme right-wing abortion bans and other health care restrictions have been for women across the country and do everything we can to restore every woman’s right to make her own health care decisions.”DetailsWhat:Senate HELP Committee Hearing titled, “The Assault on Women’s Freedoms: How Abortion Bans Have Created a Health Care Nightmare Across America”When:Tuesday, June 4, 10:00 a.m. ETWhere:Room 106, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders on ICC Seeking Arrest Warrants for Hamas and Israeli Leaders Amidst the Ongoing Humanitarian Disaster in Gaza
Date: May 22, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday night spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders amidst the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Gaza:

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

Mr. President, there has been a lot of attention and controversy attached to a recent action by the international criminal court, the ICC.

The core purpose of the ICC is to prosecute the most serious international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. I believe it is very important that all of us support accountability for these crimes and the important mission of the ICC.

Mr. President, last year the ICC declared that President Vladimir Putin of Russia was in violation of international law and that he was a war criminal.

The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and one of his senior officials saying there are reasonable grounds to believe that they had committed the war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer of population for their systematic kidnapping of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children.

I supported the ICC decision, and, in fact, that is the tip of the iceberg of what Putin has done in Ukraine. Putin started the mostly destructive war in Europe since World War II. He has bombed civilians and devastated civilian infrastructure, killing at least 30,000 civilians and displacing millions more. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded as a result of Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine.

On that occasion, when the ICC declared Putin a war criminal, the United States government welcomed the ICC decision. A White House spokesperson said “there is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable. The ICC prosecutor is an independent actor and makes his own prosecutorial decisions based on the evidence before him. We support accountability for perpetrators of war crimes.” That is what a U.S. government spokesperson said in March 2023, and I agree. In my view, Mr. Putin is in fact a war criminal.

Mr. President, we live in a world of increasing division, tension, and hostility. Around the globe, countries are dramatically increasing their military budgets. More countries are attempting to gain nuclear weapons and other dangerous weapons systems. It is in times like these that we most need international law. Without it, we will have an even more violent world where might makes right and where war criminals can act with impunity.

In recent years, the ICC has attempted to hold governments and political leaders accountable for crimes against humanity. That is what they do, and that is what they are supposed to do. All wars are terrible, and very often civilian casualties are unavoidable. But after the horrors of the second World War, countries throughout the world came together to try to establish rules to govern the conduct of war and to limit civilian casualties. The ICC’s role is to enforce these limits.

Mr. President, yesterday the ICC prosecutor announced that he was requesting arrest warrants for three top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, the group’s leader in Gaza.

To my mind, Sinwar and his Hamas accomplices are clearly war criminals. The horrific October 7th terrorist attack on Israel began this war and included the mass murder of 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, the taking of hundreds of hostages, and sexual violence against captives. These war crimes are well documented, and very few people would dispute the merits of those charges.

Mr. President, the ICC prosecutor also asked for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant. The ICC charges focus on the use of starvation of civilians as a method of war as well as intentional attacks against the civilian population. Those are the charges. The use of starvation of civilians as a method of war – clearly a war crime – as well as intentional attacks against the civilian population.

Specifically, the prosecutor says that Netanyahu is responsible for “depriving [civilians] of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the Geneva Conventions.”

Now, many people here in the Beltway, in Washington, have responded negatively to this decision from the ICC prosecutor. It seems that some folks here were comfortable with what the ICC did in terms of Putin and in terms of Sinwar, but not with Netanyahu. Some have argued that it is unfair to compare the democratically elected head of the Israeli government to Putin, who runs an authoritarian system, or Sinwar, the head of a terrorist organization.

But that is not what the ICC has done. In fact, the ICC prosecutor has looked at what each of these leaders has done – looked at their actions – and then compared those actions to established standards of international law. In other words, the ICC is not making some claim of equivalence, as some have charged, but is in fact holding both sides in this current war to the same standard.

Yes, democratically elected officials can commit war crimes. Let me repeat: democratically elected officials can commit war crimes.

The ICC is doing its job. It’s doing what it is supposed to do. We cannot only apply international law when it is convenient. And the independent panel of international legal experts the ICC appointed to help with this case unanimously – unanimously – agreed with the charges.

Mr. President, people may be uncomfortable to see the Prime Minister of Israel charged with war crimes, but let us take a hard look at what he has actually done. And we must determine whether his actions meet the standards of being a war crime.

In seven and a half months, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed and almost 80,000 injured. Thousands more are still under the rubble, but their bodies have not been fully identified. Some 60% of the victims are women, children, or the elderly. More than 250 aid workers have been killed, including 193 U.N. staff, more than any previous conflict.

Mr. President, there are 2.2 million people living in Gaza, and more than 1.7 million of them have been forced from their homes – 75% of the population. I’m trying to think of my own state, what it would be like if three-quarters of the people were driven out of their homes. These are by and large poor people. In the last few weeks, more than 900,000 have been displaced – many of them chased out of one place, chased to another place, gone to another place. Many of these people are children, Gaza has a young population. Many of them are elderly. Many of them are sick. These are people who have been forced out of their homes and moved, and moved again, often without adequate food, without adequate water supplies, and certainly without adequate health care.

Mr. President, when we talk about war crimes, talk about attacks on civilians, let’s understand: Gaza’s housing stock has been demolished. Again, I try to think of my own state, what it would mean if 60% of the housing was destroyed. Now, if these people who have been chased their homes, displaced from their homes, are ever able to return to their communities, where are they going to live? Over 60% of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including 221,000 housing units that have been completely destroyed, leaving more than a million people homeless. Entire neighborhoods have been wiped out both by bombing and planned detonations of explosive charges.

Looking at the war, we understand that Hamas is a difficult enemy that often uses civilians to protect their own people. But what we’re talking about over 60% of the housing units in Gaza have been destroyed. It’s hard to believe that there was a terrorist in every one of those buildings.

Israel has destroyed the civilian infrastructure of Gaza. You know, wiped out their ability to have electricity. Virtually no electricity in Gaza right now, virtually no clean water, and raw sewage is running through the streets, spreading disease. Now, if that’s not an attack on civilians, I don’t know what is.

The healthcare system in Gaza has been systematically annihilated, 21 hospitals have been made inoperable. In fact, of the 36 hospitals in Gaza, only four have not been damaged by bombardment, raided by the Israeli military, or closed. More than 400 health care workers have been killed.

Well, what do we say when we have a war in which the healthcare system is annihilated at a time when you have tens and tens of thousands of people who are wounded, many of them seriously?

Mr. President, the education system in Gaza has been virtually destroyed. Every one of Gaza’s 12 universities has been bombed. Got that? Every one of the 12 universities in Gaza has been bombed. More than 400 schools have suffered direct hits and 56 schools have been totally destroyed. Today, 625,000 children in Gaza have no access to education at all.

And I’ll tell you something else. When you talk about what’s going on in Gaza, what is not talked about almost at all – I think I read one article on it – I want you to think about the psychic damage being done to children. The children who see housing being destroyed, their parents or relatives being killed, who see drones flying around them, some of which have guns, being pushed out of their homes, deafening noise, inadequate food, inadequate water, pushed, shoved into any place, everyplace. If there is one child in Gaza that does not suffer psychic damage from this horror, I will be very surprised.

Mr. President, as a result of the destruction and Israeli policies restricting the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, more than a million people today face catastrophic levels of hunger and Gaza remains on the brink of famine. Hundreds of thousands of children face starvation. Even now, more than seven months into this war, Israel’s invasion of Rafah has severely disrupted the humanitarian relief operation, closing the two main border crossings and making it almost impossible for the U.N. to access warehouses or distribute aid.

Very little aid has gotten in for more than two weeks, bakeries have had to shut down, and hospitals are running low on fuel. Just today, the U.N. announced that it had been forced to halt all food distribution in Rafah after running out of supplies. The World Food Programme said “humanitarian operations in Gaza are near collapse,” saying that if food and other supplies don’t resume entering Gaza “in massive quantities, famine-like conditions will spread.”

Now, Mr. Netanyahu’s been on TV today, and elsewhere. He denies it all. Ain’t true, says Mr. Netanyahu. He claims that Israel is deeply worried about the civilian population, worried about the children, and that Israel is not blocking humanitarian aid at all. Not at all. Well, it turns out that the United Nations and virtually every other humanitarian group involved in the humanitarian disaster in Gaza strongly disagrees with Mr. Netanyahu.

Now, we can trust the words of a Prime Minister under criminal indictment in Israel, or we can trust the people whose function in life is to provide humanitarian aid.

The U.N. Secretary General says that much more aid is urgently needed to “avert an entirely preventable human-made famine” and that “there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes.”

Cindy McCain, the wife of our former Republican colleague John McCain, who is now the head of the World Food Programme, said of Gaza, “there is famine, full-blown famine in the north and it is moving south.”

A month ago, more than 50 humanitarian organizations called on Israel to allow greater humanitarian access and stop unnecessarily restricting aid. That’s 50 humanitarian organizations. Mr. Netanyahu says one thing, but 50 organizations who are desperately trying to the get food to hungry people say something else. Let the world decide who is telling the truth. And this group of humanitarian organizations included Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Mercy Corps, Oxfam, Save The Children, Refugees International, and scores of other well-respected humanitarian organizations – they say that Netanyahu and his team have blocked humanitarian aid.

Mr. President, two of our colleagues, Senator Van Hollen and Senator Merkley, visited Rafah in January, and I heard their presentation to the Democratic caucus. Upset by the unreasonable Israeli restrictions on aid, they talked about trucks being inspected and inspected, sent back, that things that should have been allowed to get through were not allowed to get through. They said afterward that the U.S. must, “demand that the Netanyahu government lift the impediments for delivery of basic goods needed to sustain life in Gaza.” Netanyahu denies it, two of our colleagues who were there say that Israel has blocking aid.

The United States government also disagrees with Netanyahu. USAID Administrator Samantha Power said, “food has not flowed in sufficient quantities to avoid this infinite famine in the south and it is giving rise to child deaths in the north.” In March, Secretary of State Blinken said, “the bottom line is food is getting in, but it is insufficient.” In April he said, “there has been progress, but it is not enough. We still need to get more aid in and around Gaza.” In a formal report this month, the State Department said, “Israel did not fully cooperate with the United States government efforts and the United States government-supported international efforts to maximize humanitarian assistance flow to and distribution within Gaza.”

I got a kick out of hearing Mr. Netanyahu this afternoon. He talked about airlifts. My god, they’re supporting air drops, they’re supporting food coming in from the sea. The reason the United States is spending millions of dollars getting food in from the sea is precisely because Israel is blocking the ability to get trucks in! And the reason that Jordan and the other countries and the United States are doing air drops is once again because trucks cannot get through. Netanyahu is taking credit, and yet the reason we’re having to do those things is precisely because of the policies of his government.

President Biden himself has said, “a the major reason that distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult [is] because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians… Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians,” President Joe Biden.

So, it is fair to say that most of the world disagrees with Mr. Netanyahu.

Mr. President, think about all of that destruction. Think about the tens of thousands of civilians killed, the schools and hospitals blown up. Take a look at the pictures of emaciated children starving to death while food sits miles away.

One of the interesting things to my mind is that we don’t see enough of those pictures. And maybe that has something to do with the fact that the Israeli military has killed dozens and dozens and dozens of journalists. I just met with some journalists last week, including a young man who happens to come from my home state of Vermont who had no doubt he was targeted, along with other press people. Big press symbols on their coats, and they were attacked. He was slightly injured, one of his colleagues was killed, and another one was severely injured.

Now, if you add all that stuff up, are these actions war crimes?

Yeah. I believe that they are. I believe that there is substantial evidence that the extreme right-wing Israeli government led by Netanyahu has used starvation as a weapon of war and has clearly targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure.

As I think we all agree, I certainly do, Israel had the right to defend itself against the Hamas terrorist attack of October 7th. But it did not – and this is where we get into the issue of war crimes – yes, you have the right to defend yourselves. Yes, Israel has the right to go after Hamas, very few people doubt that. But Netanyahu and his government do not have the right to wage an all-out war against the children, against the women, against the innocent people of Gaza. And for that, there must be consequences.

What the ICC has done is important for the global community, in the sense that we cannot allow the human race to descend to barbarity. Somebody has got to say: look, war is terrible, and it’s a little bit embarrassing as a human being that we’ve been at war for thousands of years and have not seemed to make much progress at eliminating war. But if there is war, let us learn from what happened in the past and do our best to protect the women, the children, the innocent people. So, Israel had a right to defend itself against a terrible enemy in Hamas, but it does not have the right to wage an all-out war against the people of Gaza.

Now, what the ICC is doing is important for the world. It’s [a message] to leaders all over the world – dictators, people in democratic countries – that if you go to war you cannot wage all-out war against civilians. That’s what the ICC is doing, that’s important. But it is also important, Mr. President, for those of us in the United States. Our nation claims to be the leader of the free world, and at our best we try to mobilize countries to uphold international war and prevent crimes against humanity. That is what we try to do and have done.

But Mr. President, how can or how will the United States be able to criticize any country in the world, whether it is Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else – any other country in the world – if we actually believe what Netanyahu is saying?

If we turn our backs and ignore the crimes against humanity that are being committed in Gaza right now, what credibility will we ever have in criticizing the actions of any country, no matter how terrible those actions may be? Because people will say, oh, really? You’re attacking China, Turkey, anybody else, really? You’re really deeply concerned? But apparently for Netanyahu, it’s allowed. We don’t believe you.

And I don’t want to see this great country of ours be in that position. I want to see this country respected all over the world as a country that does believe in human rights, that does believe in international law.

The ICC as I see it is trying to uphold international law and minimum standards of decency. Our government should do no less.

I yield.

Title: NEWS: Sanders on NIH Proposal to Lower Prices for Taxpayer-Funded Drugs
Date: May 21, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 21 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement on Tuesday after the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)proposed a new policyto require companies that make drugs invented by NIH scientists more accessible:

Let me thank Dr. Monica Bertagnolli for releasing a plan today that will begin to make prescription drugs invented by scientists at the National Institutes of Health more accessible in the United States and throughout the world.

For nearly three decades, the NIH has given away prescription drugs invented by federal scientists to pharmaceutical companies with virtually no strings attached. As a result of this absurd policy, the average price of new medical treatments that NIH scientists helped invent is over $111,000 – including Hemgenix, which costs an astronomical $3.5 million and the cancer therapy Yescarta, which costs $424,000. I hope that today will mark the beginning of the end of that policy and will lead to substantially lower prices for prescription drugs developed at taxpayer expense.

As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I look forward to continuing to work with the NIH and the Biden Administration to make sure that Americans no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, while also making life-saving medicine accessible to patients in low- and middle-income countries across the globe.

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders relating to the Israel-Gaza conflict:In the last several years, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for political leaders who violate international law and engage in war crimes and crimes against humanity. That includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose illegal invasion of Ukraine initiated the most destructive war in Europe since World War II; Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who started the horrific war in Gaza by launching a terrorist attack against Israel, which killed 1,200 innocent men, women, and children; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, in response, has waged an unprecedented war of destruction against the entire Palestinian people, which has killed or injured over 5 percent of the population.The ICC prosecutor is right to take these actions. These arrest warrants may or may not be carried out, but it is imperative that the global community uphold international law. Without these standards of decency and morality, this planet may rapidly descend into anarchy, never-ending wars, and barbarism.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Commencement Address for University of New England’s 2024 Graduating Class
Date: May 20, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), on Saturday, May 18, gave the commencement speech at University of New England’s (UNE) graduation ceremony. UNE is the number one provider of health care professionals for the state of Maine and an important health workforce educator for Vermont, New England, and the country. In his address, Sanders discussed the state of the American health care system and celebrated the work and futures of the 1,500 students graduating that day in fields of medicine, dental care, pharmacy, allied health professions, marine and environmental sciences, humanities, the social sciences, education, and business.The senator was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Law during the ceremony.Sanders’ live remarks are transcribed below and can be watchedHERE:Congratulations!And I know that this is a momentous day for you and for your parents. So, I’m not going to bore you by going on for too too long. Modestly long.And let me thank Dr. Herbert for inviting me to be with you and congratulate the students and faculty on this important day.For a number of years, I have had the privilege of working with Dr. Herbert and UNE on ideas, as he mentioned, as to how we can address the very serious workforce crisis we have in health care throughout our country. And working together we have made some progress but obviously a lot more needs to be done. But I want to thank Dr. Herbert for all of his help.And let me tell you why I am here at UNE today. And why my son and I traveled 5 hours from Burlington to get here in the middle of the night.And that is, I am extremely impressed by this university. And I happen to believe that you are one of the great universities in the United States of America.Why do I say that? And why do I believe it?Why I say that is that you are doing what far too few universities are doing. This university is taking a look at the crises facing our country and is saying, “Alright, how do we get our young people out into the world to address those crises?” And I got to tell you not every university in America is doing that. So, I thank you all very much.You know, a few minutes ago, we heard from Megan who sang a beautiful rendition of America the Beautiful. And in so many ways, and as somebody who has been all over this country and every state in the Union, we are an incredibly beautiful country. In so many ways. But we would be dishonest with ourselves, if we did not acknowledge that in this particular moment in American history, we have many, many crises. And on your shoulders, and I don’t envy you, you are entering the workforce at a very difficult time in American history. But we are depending on you with full confidence, that you’re going to have the strength, the energy, the vision, the morality, to turn this country around and make it the beautiful nation that we know that it can become.And a key part of what we have to do as a nation is to train the next generation of doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacist, and others to provide the highest quality care that the people in Maine, Vermont, New England, and the country desperately need – and that is exactly what you are doing.Now, if you want to fall asleep soon that’s okay. But I want you to remember just two points that I’m gonna make. And that is number one: For those of you who are entering the health care workforce. The work you are doing is of extraordinary importance and I cannot think of work that is more important. You are saving people’s lives. You’re easing suffering. You’re extending longevity. You’re delivering babies. You’re taking care of the people who are at the end of their lives. There is nothing more important than that. And I know based on the education you have received here and the values you’ve received from your parents, you’re going to do a great job doing that. That’s the main point that I want to make to you.Second point. I wish that I could tell you that the system that you are entering is a system designed to allow you to do the important work that you are trained to do. I wish I could tell you that out there you are going to be able to move aggressively to take care of the people of our region and our country in the best way possible. But if I told you that I would be lying to you, because that is far, far from the case.So let me begin by saying what you all know. Think about it for a second and that is that every person in our country, every person in the world, wants to live long, happy, and productive lives. That’s what we want to do. That should be the goal of our nation. How do we create a society in which we have good life expectancy, where people are happy, where people are healthy?All of us want to make sure that we have the strength and the health to have happy and productive family lives and work lives. All of us want to avoid chronic and debilitating illnesses. All of us want to have good sight and good hearing and good teeth. All of us want to live long enough to welcome our grandchildren and great grandchildren into this world. And all of that, whether or not we succeed in that direction, depends upon the quality of health care that we provide as a nation. And in fact when you talk about health care, it is not some abstract idea. This is, to a significant degree, is what a nation stands for.Are we a nation that says everybody is entitled to health care whether you’re rich or poor, you’re in rural America, you’re in urban America. Is it our goal, to say that we want Americans to live as long as is possible?So I think the fundamental question that every person in this arena has to answer is a very simple one. And that is will we as a nation, live up to the lofty words in our Declaration of Independence that quote, “Men” and we would say women “are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” That’s our Declaration of Independence.Is that what we are striving for? Or will our quality of life, our health, and our longevity continue to be determined by how much money we have, and by the greed of very powerful special interests that dominate the health care system in America today? That’s the question.As Dr. Herbert mentioned, I am proudly the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. And in that position, let me be very blunt, and tell you what is not often enough acknowledged. And that is that the health care system in the United States of America is broken. It is dysfunctional and it is cruel.It is a system, which as many of you know, spends almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. We are spending an astronomical sum, over $13,000 for every man, woman, and child. $52,000 for a family of four. And yet, despite those huge expenditures, we have 85 million Americans who are uninsured, no insurance at all, or underinsured – high deductibles and copayments. We live in a society where one out of four Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. And we live in a nation, unbelievably, where some 60,000 Americans die each year because they haven’t been able to get to a doctor on time. Because they don’t have insurance or inadequate insurance.Despite spending double what other countries are spending. Our life expectancy, how long we live, is lower by far than almost every other major country on Earth and it is actually in decline. And what is extremely important to know and virtually never talked about, is not only is our life expectancy below other countries, the gap between the rich and working families and the poor is enormous.The estimate is that if you are rich, you will live 10 years longer in America than if you are poor. Poverty is a death sentence. The current American health care system is a system in which some half a million Americans go bankrupt because of medically related debt. Think about that. Think about somebody ending up in the hospital because they have cancer or heart disease. They come out with a few $100,000 in debt they can’t afford to pay. They have to struggle not only to get well, from a serious illness, they got to worry about whether their family is going bankrupt. That is in the richest country in the history of the world.The broken system that we have creates a situation in which large parts of our country the areas are medically underserved. We don’t have enough doctors, nurses, etc. Where rural hospitals are being shut down. And we are people, even if you have decent insurance, have to travel hours in order to find a doctor.It is a system in which, in the midst of a major mental health crisis and COVID exacerbated what was already a serious problem, when over 100,000 Americans died last year from drug overdoses, suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety are rising, Americans are unable to afford or find the mental health care or the substance abuse treatment that they need.It is a system where despite our huge expenditures, and this is really quite remarkable as well. You would think that when you spend double what any other country is spending, you would have enough doctors, you would have enough nurses, you would have enough dentists, you have enough mental health specialists, you would have enough pharmacists. And yet we are facing, and I appreciate what UNE is doing to help address this crisis, we have a major major workforce shortage in health care.It is an irrational, irrational system in which young people who want to go into health care, including I suspect some of you here right now, are going to leave school deeply in debt. That true?So, I want you to think about this for a moment. The country desperately needs, desperately needs, doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health counselors, etc. And yet what we are saying to young people, if you go into that profession and you’re from a working class to a middle-class background, the immediate reward you gonna get is you’re going to leave school three or $400,000 in debt.Between you and me, that is insane.Which is by the way, why we are trying hard to forgive all student debt in America.It is a system in which Black, Latino, and Native American doctors and nurses are grossly underrepresented as well medical professionals.It is a system so complex that millions of Americans simply cannot get the care they need even when it is available, even when they are entitled to coverage.So all over this country, people are up to here. My wife has a PhD, and thank you for giving me this honorary degree – we’ll have two doctors in the family now. But she really earned hers. I talk to her and everybody else in this country about the forms you have to fill out in order to get the coverage that you thought you were entitled to.And this bureaucracy and this paperwork is not only enormously frustrating, the complexity of the system for patients, it is equally frustrating for the doctors and nurses and those who take care of us. You are being trained as health care professionals to provide the best care possible to your patients. Not to spend an ungodly amount of time filling out forms to please the insurance companies.Further, and this again is an issue that needs discussion and thought. We have a health care system in which the quality of the care you receive is dependent, dependent upon the generosity of your employer, or whether perhaps you have a decent union. So, you work for a large company, profitable company, you get good health insurance. You work for McDonald’s, you really don’t get any health insurance at all because you can’t afford the minimal insurance they provide.Does that mean to say that the worker at McDonald’s or Walmart is less in need of health care than somebody who works in a large corporation and has good health insurance? The answer obviously, is not.I have had the opportunity, the honor, to travel all over this country. And in that capacity. I have held hundreds of town meetings, often dealing with health care. One of the things that I also learned when you talk about an employer-based health care system, you get your health care from your job. Is there are millions of Americans today who are on their jobs, not because they enjoy their jobs. They’re on the jobs because they have good health care. How many people I’ve talked who say, “Look, I have a kid who’s really sick and I got great health insurance. I really don’t like the job, but I’m going to stay on the job.” That is dispiriting to those people. So, the bottom line of this whole thing is you in your own hearts have got to make a decision. Is health care a human right for all people? Or is it a privilege? That is the fundamental issue of our time.And further, our current health care system fails to fully recognize that health care is more than just walking into a doctor’s office or entering a hospital. It is about every aspect of our lives.Yes, dental care is health care.Yes, the treatment of mental illness is health care.Yes, providing services to millions of elderly and disabled Americans in their home is health care.And here’s the point that some may disagree with me on but I think it has to be made. The health care system today is working phenomenally well. It’s an extraordinary system.For the people who own the system.In my view, the function of the American health care system is not to provide quality care to all people. It is to make maximum profits for the insurance companies, the drug companies, and the medical equipment suppliers.And they are in fact succeeding.So, the health care system today is doing what it is supposed to do. Huge profits for drug companies. Huge profits for the insurance companies. I had a guy in front of my committee, head of a drug company – $50 million a year in salary. That’s what these guys make. They’re doing really well. The system is in fact working. But it is not working for ordinary Americans.What do we do? And one other issue on that. All over the world, what systems understand whose goal is to keep people healthy, is you invest in primary health care. Now why do you do that? Because if you keep people healthy, they live longer and happier lives. And if you don’t, they’re going to end up in emergency rooms and in the hospital, at great expense to the system. But because our system is based on tertiary health care – they do a great job when you’re really ill and you go to the hospital. We do not do a great job in keeping people healthy through preventative care or primary care. We are spending less than half as much as other systems around the world on primary health care.So those are some of the problems. So what do we do? And the answer is twofold.Number one, as I said earlier, your job, and we desperately need you, is to go out into the world and provide the best quality care that you can. That’s your job. That’s your mission. And I know you’re going to do that.But second of all, what we have got to do is move the current dysfunctional system away from a for profit system, designed to make the owners of the system wealthier. To a system which provides quality health care to all people. Now there are various ways to do it and every country in the world except us, by the way, provides universal health care to all their people. They’re all a little bit different.But bottom line is if you go to a country like Canada, not so far away from us. And you end up in the hospital, for a month after major surgery or whatever, the bill you get when you leave is zero. You get any doctor you want and your bill is zero. And yet they end up spending half as much as we do per capita.So I believe that Medicare in America, traditional Medicare is the foundation upon which we can build a strong national health care system. What we have got to do is expand Medicare to cover all people in this country. Expand Medicare to cover dental care, to cover vision care, to cover hearing care, to cover comprehensive care.We can create – I know it sounds radical, I know it sounds utopian, but it exists in other countries around the world. We can create a system in which people can go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want, and not have to take out their wallet. That in fact exists in many countries around the world. And we can pay for that. By eliminating the many hundreds of billions of dollars we spend every single year on administration, unnecessary administration, and billing.During COVID we had hospitals almost shutting down. No doctors the nurses. Yet the bill collectors were there every single day. We are spending huge amounts of money billing people, hounding people to pay their bills. We should be spending health care dollars on providing health care to people, not making insurance companies even wealthier.So that’s the challenge that we face. Every other country on Earth guarantees health care to all people as a human right. We don’t. And yet we spend twice as much as other countries.We can do better.We must do better.And with your help, I am confident we will do better.Thank you all very much.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Address America’s Dental Crisis
Date: May 17, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 17 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), today introduced legislation to address the dental care crisis in America. The Comprehensive Dental Care Reform Act of 2024 would expand Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA to provide comprehensive dental coverage to all of our nation’s seniors, veterans, and low-income children, individuals, and families. This bill would substantially increase the number of dentists, dental hygienists, and dental therapists in America particularly in rural and under-served areas. It would also make dental care services available in more community health centers, schools, nursing homes, and mobile units throughout the country. Moreover, it would make dental care an essential benefit under the Affordable Care Act and increase woefully inadequate reimbursement rates for dental procedures under Medicaid.

Yesterday, Sanders also led a HELP Committeehearingon the crisis.

The legislation is cosponsored by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and is endorsed by Families USA, CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, and Community Catalyst.

“Dental care in America is way too expensive,” said Sanders. “Far too many Americans, especially in rural areas, do not have access to a dentist, which forces them to either travel long distances or go without the care they need. Very few dentists accept Medicaid, preventing the most vulnerable people in America from getting the dental procedures they need. And there is a major lack of transparency in the prices dentists charge. The results have been tragic: One out of five seniors in our country are missing all of their natural teeth. Over 40 percent of children in America have tooth decay by the time they reach kindergarten. And about half of Americans with dental insurance skip getting the dental care they need because they cannot afford it. That is why I have introduced the most comprehensive dental care bill in the history of our country. Dental care is health care and health care must be considered a human right, not a privilege.”

Today in America, nearly 70 million adults and nearly 8 million children have no dental insurance and many of those who do have dental insurance find that coverage to be totally inadequate. In fact, nearly half of Americans who have dental insurance have skipped their appointments because they could not afford to pay for the dental procedures they need. Nearly one out of every five seniors in America have lost all of their natural teeth and many of them cannot afford dentures – which can cost many thousands of dollars. Seventy percent of older Americans have some sort of periodontal disease which can lead to rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Research shows that treating periodontal disease in people with chronic health conditions can save money. In fact, up to $27.8 billion could be saved annually for Medicare patients with heart disease if these patients got the dental treatment they need.

The lack of affordable dental care is a problem all over America, but it is especially acute for low-income Americans, pregnant women, people with disabilities, veterans, those who live in rural communities, and Black, Latino and Native Americans. The situation has become so absurd, that each and every year hundreds of thousands of Americans travel to countries like Mexico, Costa Rica, India, Thailand and Hungary where it is much less expensive to get the dental care they need even after paying for round-trip airfare and hotel stays.

Each year, visits to the emergency department for dental care cost over $2 billion, but research shows that nearly 79 percent of those visits could have been addressed by a visit to the dentist, which would save up to $1.7 billion per year. In 2019, nearly 2 million Americans had to go to emergency rooms across the country for preventative dental procedures – a 62 percent increase from 2014.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders Releases Report Exposing How Weight Loss Drugs Could Bankrupt American Health Care
Date: May 15, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 15 — As part of his investigation into the outrageously high price of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today released a stunning new report exposing the potential of weight loss drugs to bankrupt American health care.

In the report, HELP Committee Majority Staff modeled how new weight loss drugs could impact prescription drug spending, even while taking into account estimated manufacturer discounts. Key findings from the report include:

“Today’s report makes it crystal clear: The outrageously high price of Wegovy and other weight loss drugs have the potential to bankrupt Medicare and our entire health care system,” Sanders said. “The unjustifiably high prices of these weight loss drugs could also cause a massive spike in prescription drug spending that could lead to an historic increase in premiums for Medicare and everyone who has health insurance. The United States Congress and the federal government cannot allow that to happen. There is no rational reason, other than greed, for Novo Nordisk to charge Americans struggling with obesity $1,349 for Wegovy when this same exact product can be purchased for just $186 in Denmark, $137 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom, while it costs less than $5 to profitably manufacture.”

On April 24, 2024, the HELP Committeelaunched an investigationinto the outrageously high prices Novo Nordisk is charging for Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S. On April 30, Chairman Sanders commended the Federal Trade Commission for taking bold action against the bogus patents Novo Nordisk has filed to prevent Americans from receiving a generic version of Ozempic at a much lower price. On May 13, Chairman Sanders wrote anop-edon the front page of the Danish paper Politiken to appeal to Denmark’s longstanding commitment to social justice and to win their help in urging Novo Nordisk to reduce the outrageous price of Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S.

WASHINGTON, May 15 – In a recent letter to President Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) joined with nine other senators from disaster-impacted states to urge the administration to reevaluate and resubmit its request for supplemental disaster funding. The letter comes as Congress is reviewing requests for FY2025 funding priorities and as communities across the country are still struggling to fully recover from recent disasters – including the devastating floods that hit Vermont last summer and the terrible fires that struck Hawaii.“Last October, the Administration requested $23.5 billion for disaster recovery,” the senators wrote. “Since then, the need for recovery resources in our communities have grown and evolved. The nation has also witnessed additional crises, including the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland. This funding is essential for our constituents to move forward in rebuilding their homes, lives, businesses, farms, and communities.”The senators continued, “We request that the Administration reevaluate the nation’s outstanding disaster recovery funding requirements and resubmit a request for supplemental appropriations that reflects the current reality. A better understanding of the country’s current urgent needs would inform Congress’s work and we recommend that the Administration act as quickly as possible.”The letter was also signed by Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders to Lead HELP Committee in Hearing on Dental Crisis in America
Date: May 14, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, this Thursday, May 16 at 10:00 a.m. ET, will lead the committee in a hearing titled, “Examining the Dental Care Crisis in America: How Can We Make Dental Care More Affordable and More Available?”

“In America today we have a dental crisis that we have got to address,” said Chairman Sanders. “Dental care in America is way too expensive. We don’t have enough dentists, dental hygienists, or dental therapists. Far too many Americans, especially in rural areas, do not have access to a dentist, which forces them to either travel long distances or go without the care they need. Very few dentists accept Medicaid preventing the most vulnerable people in America from getting the dental procedures they need. And there is a major lack of transparency in the prices dentists charge. The results have been tragic: One out of five seniors in our country are missing all of their natural teeth. Over 40% of children in America have tooth decay by the time they reach kindergarten. And about half of Americans with dental insurance skip getting the dental care they need because they cannot afford it. That is unacceptable and must change.”

In the United States today, 91 million Americans do not have any dental insurance. More than 40% of children in America have tooth decay by the time they reach kindergarten, and about half of our nation’s seniors have no dental insurance. One out of five seniors are missing all their natural teeth and cannot afford a full set of dentures, which can cost many thousands of dollars. Nearly half of adults have some form of periodontal disease, which makes them two to three times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular event.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Rafah
Date: May 10, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement outlining the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza and urging President Biden to make clear that further attacks on Rafah will result in the end of all U.S. military aid to the Netanyahu government:For five days, almost no humanitarian aid has gotten into Gaza. Israel’s military operation in Rafah has displaced another 110,000 people and closed both main border crossings. That means no food, no water, no medicine, no fuel. And now Israel is threatening to expand that operation.Hundreds of thousands of children were starving and famine was imminent even before this military operation crippled the humanitarian aid operation. Israel’s Rafah invasion is already having a dramatic effect and making a catastrophic situation even worse.Bakeries are shutting down. Food can’t be distributed. Soon, hospitals will go dark as they run out of fuel. Incubators, ventilators, and critical machinery will stop working. Thousands more women, children, and innocent people will die.The United Nations Secretary General said today that an “attack in Rafah would lead to an epic humanitarian disaster.” There is simply no way for humanitarian organizations to effectively deliver lifesaving aid in the midst of active fighting around Rafah.That is why President Biden was right to withhold 2,000-pound bombs for Israel – bombs that could only cause massive civilian death in densely-populated Rafah.Over the years the U.S. has provided tens of billions in military aid to Israel. We must make it very clear: an invasion of Rafah means an end to all U.S. military aid to Netanyahu’s right-wing, extremist government. Period. End of discussion.We cannot continue to be complicit in this humanitarian disaster.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Israel’s Threat to Attack Rafah
Date: May 9, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday released the following statement regarding the threat of Israel’s all-out assault on Rafah:Almost 35,000 Palestinians have already been killed in this war, and more than 78,000 have been wounded – 70 percent of whom are women and children. As we speak, hundreds of thousands more children face the possibility of malnutrition and starvation.An attack on Rafah would simply make an unspeakable situation even worse. As a result of the displacement of 80 percent of the population of Gaza, about 1.3 million people, including 600,000 children, are sheltering in Rafah. It’s densely crowded, with roughly 50,000 people per square mile. This is also where the vast majority of humanitarian aid is received and distributed, and where most of the few remaining medical facilities are located.President Biden is right – the United States cannot continue to provide more bombs and artillery shells to support Netanyahu’s disastrous and inhumane war policies.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Merkley, Khanna, Tlaib Introduce Legislation to Eliminate Medical Debt for Millions of Working Class Americans
Date: May 8, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 8 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), with Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), today introduced legislation to eliminate all$220 billionin medical debt held bymillionsof Americans, wipe it from credit reports, and drastically limit the accrual of future medical debt.The medical debt crisis has exploded in recent years, decimating Americans’ bank accounts and deterring them from seeking health care. Among all working-age adults in the United States, anestimated 27 percentare currently carrying medical debt of more than $500, and 15 percent have medical debt loads of $2,000 or more.“This is the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world. People in our country should not be going bankrupt because they got cancer and could not afford to pay their medical bills,”Sanders said.“No one in America should face financial ruin because of the outrageous cost of an unexpected medical emergency or a hospital stay. The time has come to cancel all medical debt and guarantee health care to all as a human right, not a privilege.”Said Merkley:“Patients should be able to get the care they need when facing illness or injury without fear of financial ruin. America’s medical debt crisis continues to harm millions, and Congress must do all it can to relieve patients of this tremendous burden. Our Medical Debt Cancellation Act sets up a grant program to cancel patient medical debt. This bill is a common-sense step forward that will help families in Oregon and across the nation.”“Our current health care system is bankrupting Americans. I’ve heard heartbreaking stories from constituents who have skipped doctor’s appointments due to cost, who have lost loved ones because they couldn’t afford their medication, and who aren’t able to buy a house or get a job because of crippling medical debt,”said Khanna.“I’m so proud to join Senator Sanders to cancel medical debt, wipe it from credit reports and reform our system going forward. This bill would transform the lives of millions of Americans and I couldn’t ask for a better partner in the fight.”Millions of Americans struggle to pay their medical bills every year or are paying off medical debt. In 2018 alone, 8 million people were pushed intopovertydue to medical expenses. Nearly 75 percent of adults in the U.S. say they are worried about being able to afford unexpected medical bills andnearly one out of every fourpeople say they have skipped medical treatment because of concerns about cost, includingone in fiveadults with health insurance coverage.Medical debt can ruin credit scores and make it challenging to get a loan, take out a mortgage, or buy a car. Today, nearly four in ten American adults report having health care debt, and one out of every 12 American adults report having significant debt. Women, Black Americans, people with disabilities, and those living in rural areas and the South arehit the hardest. As a result of the broken U.S. health care system,one in threeBlack Americans have past due medical bills, as well asnearly halfof American women, andnearly halfof adults living in the South.The problem is only getting worse. Research from Yale and Stanfordrevealeda recent spike in hospitals, including non-profit and public hospitals, bringing medical debt lawsuits against patients over unpaid medical bills – disproportionately impacting Black and low-income patients and patients living in rural areas.In support of the lawmakers’ legislation, medical debt expert and economist at Stanford UniversityDr. Neale Mahoney, said: “Evidence shows that earlier is better when it comes to medical debt relief. This bill cuts off medical debt at the source by requiring hospitals to uphold their obligation to provide charity care to eligible patients who cannot afford to pay and supports hospitals so they can forgive debt before it gets sold to debt collectors.”“Medical debt and aggressive collection practices cause our patients to delay necessary care and destroy the trust necessary for healing relationships,”Dr. Luke Messac, Harvard Medical School emergency physician and historian. “Most health care workers do not want to be part of a system that does such damage to our patients’ lives. This bill helps prevent this harm by cancelling debt, improving access to financial assistance, and preventing medical bills from ruining credit scores.”If enacted, the Medical Debt Cancellation Act would:

Canceling medical debt is a common sense positionoverwhelmingly supportedby the American public. That support is nonpartisan with84 percentof Republicans in favor of canceling it. In fact, when polled on which types of debt Americans would like to see forgiven,two-thirds of Americanspointed to medical debt.The legislation is endorsed by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Center for Health and Democracy, Center for Popular Democracy, Just Care USA, Public Citizen, and Social Security Works.Read the bill text,here.Read the bill section-by-section,here.

WASHINGTON, May 8 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement responding to news that the Biden Administration has held certain arms transfers to Israel:Given the unprecedented humanitarian disaster that Netanyahu’s war has created in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of children face starvation, President Biden is absolutely right to halt bomb delivery to this extreme, right-wing Israeli government. But this must be a first step. The U.S. must now use ALL its leverage to demand an immediate ceasefire, the end of the attacks on Rafah, and the immediate delivery of massive amounts of humanitarian aid to people living in desperation. Our leverage is clear. Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. We can no longer be complicit in Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders on the Nationwide Student Protests and the Ongoing Humanitarian Disaster in Gaza
Date: May 2, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday night spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the student protests taking place on college campuses across the country, and the ongoing, horrific humanitarian disaster in Gaza.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:

President, some of us have been out of school for awhile and we may have forgotten our American history. But I did want to take a moment to remind some of my colleagues about a document called the U.S. Constitution and, specifically, the First Amendment of that Constitution.

For those that may have forgotten, here is what the First Amendment says: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Let me also take this opportunity to remember our late colleague, the former congressman John Lewis for his heroic role in the Civil Rights Movement.

I know it’s very easy to heap praise on Congressman Lewis and many others decades after they did what they did, but, I would remind my colleagues them that Mr. Lewis was arrested 45 times for participating in sit-ins, occupations, and protests – 45 times – for protesting segregation and racism.

I would also remind my colleagues that the Lunch Counter protest at Woolworths and elsewhere desegregating the South were in fact sit-ins and occupations where young Black and white Americans bravely took up space in private businesses, demanding an end to racism and segregation that existed at that time.

Further, as I hope everybody knows, we have also seen in recent decades protests — some of them massive protests — against sexism, homophobia, and the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels in order to save this planet.

In other words, protesting injustice and expressing our opinions is part of our American tradition. And when you talk about America being a free country, whether you like it or not the right to protest is what American freedom is all about. That’s the U.S. constitution.

And, M. President, let me also remind you: exactly 60 years ago, student demonstrators occupied the exact same building on Columbia’s campus as is taking place right now – ironically, the same building.

Across the country, students and others, including myself, joined peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the war in Vietnam. Those demonstrators were demanding an end to that War.

And maybe – just maybe – tens of thousands of American lives and countless Vietnamese lives might have been saved if the Government had listened to those demonstrators.

And I might also add that the President at that time – a great president — Lyndon Johnson, chose not to run for re-election because of the opposition to him that occurred as a result of his support for that Vietnam War. And further, let us not forget those who demonstrated against the failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maybe those protestors should have been listened to as well.

Shock of all shocks, government policy is not always right.

President, I noted recently that a number of my colleagues in both parties, as well as many news reporters, TV, newspapers, are very concerned about the protests and violence we are seeing on campuses across the country.

So let me be clear: I share those concerns about violence on campuses, or, for that matter, any place else, and I condemn those who threw a brick through a window at Columbia University. That kind of violence should not be taking place on college campuses.

I am also concerned and condemn about the group of individuals at UCLA in California who violently attacked the peaceful encampment of anti-war demonstrators on the campus of UCLA.

President, let me be clear: I condemn all forms of violence on campus whether they are committed by people who support Israel’s war efforts or those who oppose those policies.

And I hope we can also agree that in the United States all forms of bigotry must be condemned and eliminated. We are seeing a growth of antisemitism in this country which we must all condemn and work to stop.

We are also seeing a growth of Islamophobia in this country which we must all condemn and stop. And in that regard, I would mention that in my very own city of Burlington, Vermont, three wonderful young Palestinian students were shot at close range on November 25th of last year. They were visiting a family member to celebrate Thanksgiving, walking down the street, and they were shot.

President let make an additional point, I have noted that there is an increasing tendency in the media and on the part of some of my colleagues here in the Senate to use the phrase “Pro-Palestinian” to suggest that that means “Pro-Hamas”.

To my mind, that is unacceptable and factually inaccurate. The overwhelming majority of American people and protestors understand very well that Hamas is a terrorist organization that started this war by attacking Israel in an incredibly brutal and horrific way on October 7th.

To stand up for Palestinian rights and the dignity of the Palestinian people does not make one a supporter of terrorism.

And let me also mention something that I found rather extraordinary and outrageous.

And that is just a few days ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the right-wing extremist government in Israel, a government which contains out-and-out anti-Palestinian racists.

Netanyahu issued a statement in which he equated criticism of his government’s illegal and immoral war against the Palestinian people with antisemitism.

In other words, if you are protesting, or disagree, with what Netanyahu and his extremist government are doing in Gaza, you are an antisemite.

That is an outrageous statement from a leader who is clearly trying – and I have to tell you, he seems to be succeeding with the American media — trying to deflect attention away from the horrific policies that he is pursuing that created an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.

So, let me be as clear as I can be: It is not antisemitic or pro-Hamas to point out that in almost seven months Netanyahu’s extremist government has killed 34,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 77,000 – seventy percent of whom are women and children.

And to protest that or to point that out is not antisemitic. It is simply factual.

It is not antisemitic to point out that Netanyahu’s government’s bombing has completely destroyed more than 221,000 housing units in Gaza, leaving more than one million people homeless – almost half the population. No, Mr. Netanyahu it is not antisemitic to point out what you have done in terms of the destruction of housing in Gaza.

It is not antisemitic to realize that his government has annihilated Gaza’s health care system, knocking 26 hospitals out of service and killing more than 400 health care workers. At a time when 77,000 people have been wounded and desperately need medical care, Netanyahu has systematically destroyed the health care system in Gaza.

It is not antisemitic to condemn his government’s destruction of all of Gaza’s 12 universities and 56 of its schools, with hundreds more damaged, leaving 625,000 children in Gaza have no opportunity for an education. It is not antisemitic to make that point.

It is not antisemitic to note that Netanyahu’s government has obliterated Gaza’s civilian infrastructure – there is virtually no electricity in Gaza right now, virtually no clean water in Gaza right now, and sewage is seeping out onto the streets.

It is not antisemitic to make that point.

President, it is not antisemitic to agree with virtually every humanitarian organization that functions in the Gaza area in saying that his government, in violation of American law, has unreasonably blocked humanitarian aid coming into Gaza.

They have created the conditions under which hundreds of thousands of children face malnutrition and famine. It is not antisemitic to look at photographs of children who are starving to death because they have not been able to get the food that they need. It is not antisemitic to agree with American and UN officials that parts of Gaza could become famine districts in the not very distant future.

Antisemitism is a vile and disgusting form of bigotry that has done unspeakable harm to many millions of people for hundreds of years, including my own family. But it is outrageous and it is disgraceful to use that charge of antisemitism to distract us from the immoral and illegal war policies that Netanyahu’s extremist and racist government is pursuing.

Furthermore, it is really cheap politics for Netanyahu to use the charge of antisemitism to deflect attention from the criminal indictment he is facing in the Israeli courts.

Bottomline, M. President: it is not antisemitic to hold Netanyahu and his government for their actions. That is not antisemitic. It is precisely what we should be doing.

Because among other things we are the government that has supplied billions and billions of dollars in order for him to continue his horrific war against the Palestinian people.

President, I would also point out while there has been wall to wall coverage of student protests, I think that’s about all CNN does right now, I should mention that it is not just young people on college campuses that are extremely upset about our Government’s support and funding for this illegal and immoral war.

And I would point out that just last week this Senate voted to give Netanyahu another unfettered $10 billion for his war.

Let me quote just a few polls:

April 14 – Politico/Morning Consult: 67% support the United States calling for a ceasefire. This is at a time when Netanyahu is threatening to expand the war into Rafah.

April 12th – CBS: 60% think the U.S. should not send weapons and supplies to Israel as opposed to 40% who think the U.S. should. And for my Democratic colleagues, those figures are disproportionately higher among Democratic voters.

April 10th – Economist/YouGov: 37% support decreasing military aid to Israel, just 18% support an increase. Overall 63% support a ceasefire, 15% oppose.

No, M. President. This is not just protestors on college campuses who are upset about U.S. policy with regards to Israel and Gaza. Increasingly the American people want an end to U.S. complicity in the humanitarian disaster which is taking place in Gaza right now.

The people of the United States – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – do not want to be complicit in the starvation of hundreds of thousands of children.

Maybe, and here’s a very radical idea, maybe it’s time for politicians to listen to the American people. Maybe it’s time to rethink the decision this body recently made to provide Netanyahu another $10 billion dollars in unfettered military aid.

Maybe it’s time to not simply worry about the violence we are seeing on American campuses, but focus on the unprecedented violence in Gaza which has killed 34,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 77,000 Palestinians – seventy percent of whom are women and children.

So, I suggest to CNN and some of my colleagues here, take your cameras off of Columbia and UCLA. Maybe go to Gaza and show us the emaciated children who are going to die of malnutrition because of Netanyahu’s policies. Show us the kids who have lost their arms and their legs. Show us the suffering.

President, let me conclude by saying, I must admit, I find it incomprehensible that members of Congress are spending their time attacking the protestors rather than the Netanyahu government which brought about these protests and has created this horrific situation.

Thank you and I yield.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: HELP Committee to Hold Hearing on the Shortage of Minority Health Care Providers
Date: May 1, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 1 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday, May 2 at 10:00 a.m. ET will lead the committee in a hearing titled, “What Can Congress Do to Address the Severe Shortage of Minority Health Care Professionals and the Maternal Health Crisis?”

“No one disputes that we have a massive shortage of doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health professionals, pharmacists and health care workers throughout America,” Sanders said. “This shortage is particularly acute in Black and Latino communities. We also have an alarming rate of maternal deaths in America that is disproportionately impacting Black women. That should not be happening in the richest country in the history of the world. It is long past time for the United States Congress to seriously address these major crises.”

According to the latest figures from the US Census Bureau, Black Americans make up 13.6 percent of the U.S. population, but comprise just 5 percent of all physicians, 6.3 percent of nurses, 3.8 percent of dentists, 9.6 percent of pharmacists, 4.5 percent of physician assistants, and 7 percent of certified nurse-midwives. Latinos make up 19.1 percent of the U.S. population, but comprise just 5.8 percent of all physicians, 6.9 percent of nurses, 5.9 percent of dentists, 6.4 percent of pharmacists, 7.3 percent of physician assistants, less than 8 percent of all maternal health physicians, and less than 15 percent of maternal health registered nurses.

Diversity and representation in the workforce is critical to improving patient access to care, perception of the care they receive, and overall health outcomes. Studies show that when Black and Latino patients are treated by Black and Latino doctors, they report higher satisfaction with their care, have a better relationship with their provider, and are more likely to receive preventative and follow up services. Studies also show that health care providers from communities of color are more likely to practice in high-need specialties and in underserved communities.

Congress must also address the maternal health crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women. Further, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, Black infants are almost four times more likely to die from complications due to low birthweight than white infants.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Responds to FTC’s Efforts to Target ‘Junk’ Ozempic Patents
Date: April 30, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 30 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today released the following statement after Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan announced that the FTC is taking action against the bogus patents Novo Nordisk filed to keep the outrageous price of Ozempic artificially high:

Let me commend the Federal Trade Commission, under the leadership of Chair Lina Khan, for taking bold action today against the bogus patents Novo Nordisk has filed to prevent Americans struggling with diabetes from receiving a generic version of Ozempic at a much lower price.

Novo Nordisk must not be allowed to make billions in profits by delaying generic competition for Ozempic by unlawfully filing junk patents that have nothing to do with the drug itself, but the injection pen.

Last week, the HELP Committee, that I chair,launched an investigationinto the outrageously high prices Novo Nordisk is charging for Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States. In my view, we can no longer tolerate Novo Nordisk charging the American people $969 for Ozempic when that same exact drug can be purchased for just $155 in Canada and $59 in Germany while it costs less than $5 to manufacture.

I look forward to working with the Biden administration to take on the greed of Novo Nordisk and substantially reduce the price of Ozempic and other prescription drugs.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Urges Global Pharmaceutical Industry Leaders: Prioritize Public Health Over Private Profits as Pandemic Accord Negotiations Enter Final Phase
Date: April 25, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 25 — As negotiations continue at the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish the Pandemic Accord, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent aletterto the leaders of the international global pharmaceutical industry, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) President Albert Bourla and Director General David Reddy, to reconsider their opposition to measures that would help make tests, treatments, and vaccines available to everyone who needs them.

“As leaders of the pharmaceutical industry, you play a critical role in making sure new tests, treatments and vaccines are created. The success of your scientists is humanity’s success,” wrote Sanders. “But your responsibility does not end with inventing breakthroughs. The products you develop must be made available around the world quickly and affordably. At the very least, you should not challenge governments negotiating new rules to make medicines more accessible.”

According to astudyby Yale researchers, by the time the U.S. recorded one million deaths due to COVID-19, over 40% of those deaths were caused by three COVID-19 variants first detected outside of the U.S.

Bourla also serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, which doubled its profits in 2021 and made a record $100 billion in revenue in 2022.

“There is no rational reason why vaccine manufacturers should be allowed to keep lifesaving manufacturing information secret in the face of an international public health emergency,” Sanders wrote. “That is not just the right thing to do. It is the smart thing to do to protect the American people from viruses that respect no borders.”

The negotiations over the Pandemic Accord – an international agreement under the WHO constitution aimed at strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response – began in December 2021 and are targeted to conclude May 2024.

Founded in 1948, the WHO is an agency of the United Nations dedicated to act as a coordinating authority on international health issues, including global public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

“If necessary, I will give you the opportunity to explain to the HELP Committee your decision to prioritize the profits of the pharmaceutical industry over public health imperatives,” concluded Sanders.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders Launches Investigation into Outrageously High Price of Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States
Date: April 24, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today sent aletterto the CEO of Novo Nordisk, launching an investigation into the outrageously high prices his pharmaceutical company is charging for Ozempic and Wegovy in the United States.

In his letter, Chairman Sanders wrote, “The scientists at Novo Nordisk deserve great credit for developing these drugs that have the potential to be a game changer for millions of Americans struggling with type 2 diabetes and obesity. As important as these drugs are, they will not do any good for the millions of patients who cannot afford them. Further, if the prices for these products are not substantially reduced, they have the potential to bankrupt Medicare, Medicaid and our entire health care system. The United States Congress and the federal government cannot allow that to happen.”

Novo Nordisk currently charges Americans with type 2 diabetes $969 a month for Ozempic, while this same exact drug can be purchased for just $155 in Canada and just $59 in Germany. Novo Nordisk also charges Americans with obesity $1,349 a month for Wegovy, while this same exact product can be purchased for just $140 in Germany and $92 in the United Kingdom.

Novo Nordisk’s prices are especially outrageous given a recent report from researchers at Yale University that found both of these drugs can be profitably manufactured for less than $5 a month.

“In my view, the American people should not have to pay up to $1,349 a month for prescription drugs that cost less than $5 to manufacture and can be purchased at a fraction of this price in other developed countries,” said Chairman Sanders.

“The result of these astronomically high prices is that Ozempic and Wegovy are out of reach for millions of Americans who need them,” Sanders continued. “Unfortunately, Novo Nordisk’s pricing has turned drugs that could improve people’s lives into luxury goods, all while Novo Nordisk made over $12 billion in profits last year — up 76 percent from 2021. That is unacceptable.”

The prices for these drugs are so high in the United States that everyone — regardless of whether they use the products — will likely be forced to bear the burden of Novo Nordisk’s profit maximizing strategy through higher insurance premiums and taxes.

One major commercial health insurance company told Chairman Sanders that the company would have to double premiums for all of its policy holders if it covered Wegovy and Ozempic for all eligible patients.

Public health insurance plans are seeing similar problems. The North Carolina State Health Plan stopped covering Wegovy for weight loss after estimating that continuing coverage for the drug at its current price would require them to double the premiums for all of their policy holders, regardless of whether they were taking the medication.

The unjustifiably high prices of Ozempic and Wegovy are already straining the budgets of Medicare and Medicaid and severely limiting access for patients who need these drugs.

Last year, researchers at Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago estimated that it would cost Medicare over $150 billion a year to cover Wegovy and other similar weight loss drugs. To put this in perspective, the cost of all retail prescription drugs covered by Medicare in 2022 was less than $130 billion. Further, more than 35 state Medicaid programs do not cover Wegovy at all, and dozens of states have severely restricted Ozempic coverage because of the unjustifiably high prices of these drugs.

In his letter, Chairman Sanders requested that the CEO of Novo Nordisk answer a simple question: “Will Novo Nordisk substantially reduce both the list price and the net price of both Ozempic and Wegovy?”

The letter from Chairman Sanders also requests information on the company’s internal decision-making, including information on how much the company makes from selling the product to commercial insurers and government programs. The letter also requests that the company provide information on how prices are determined and the company’s expenditures on research and development for these drugs.

I voted no tonight on the foreign aid package for one simple reason: U.S. taxpayers should not be providing billions more to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.

34,000 Palestinians have already been killed and 77,000 have been wounded – 70% of whom are women and children.

The housing in Gaza is destroyed; the infrastructure in Gaza is destroyed; the health care system in Gaza is destroyed; the educational system in Gaza is destroyed. Enough is enough. No more money for Netanyahu’s war machine.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders on Ending Unfettered Military Aid to Israel and Restoring UNRWA Funding
Date: April 23, 2024

WASHINGTON, April 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today spoke on the floor of the U.S Senate regarding his strong opposition to the provision of $8.9 billion in unfettered offensive military aid to the Israeli extremist government, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, to continue his unprecedented assault on the Palestinian people.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:

M. President,

The Senate will soon vote on a $95 billion supplemental spending package.  $95 billion. That’s a lot of money – especially at a time when many Americans are unable to afford their rent or pay their mortgages, pay their bills, afford healthcare, are struggling with student debt or many other needs. $95 billion. That’s a lot of money.

All told, this package includes tens of billions in additional military spending and major policy changes, many of which are controversial. Many of which are disagreed with by the American people. Yet, unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate will not have the opportunity to hold separate votes on the various components of this bill.

I have heard from many of my Democratic colleagues – and I agree – who talk about the dysfunctionality taking place in the House of Representatives. In fact, I don’t know if we’re quite sure who the Speaker of the House will be in a couple of weeks, or whether the extreme, extreme right-wing is going to get rid of Mr. Johnson.

But what we can say about the House is that they at least gave their members the opportunity to vote Yes or No on funding for Ukraine, Yes or No on aid to Israel, Yes or No on TikTok, Yes or No on aid to Asian countries. That is more than can be said for the U.S. Senate right now. And I remind my colleagues that this is supposedly the “greatest deliberative body in the world.” Except we don’t have many deliberations around here. We’ve got one bill, up or down.

M. President, we need to have a serious debate on  these issues. I think the American people want us to have a serious debate on these issues.  And that is why I am trying my best to secure amendment votes which, in my view, will significantly improve this bill.

As it happens, I strongly support the humanitarian aid included in this bill, which will save many thousands of lives in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, and many other places. I strongly support it. I strongly support getting Ukraine the military aid it needs to defend itself against Putin’s imperialist war. I support the Iron Dome to protect Israeli civilians from missile attacks.

But let me be very clear: I strongly support ending the provision which will give $8.9 billion in unfettered offensive military aid to the extremist Israeli government – a government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is continuing his unprecedented assault against the Palestinian people.

I also strongly oppose language in this legislation that would prohibit funding for UNRWA, the UN organization that is the backbone of the humanitarian relief operation in Gaza and the only organization that experts say has the capability to provide the humanitarian aid that is desperately needed there.

And I have filed two amendments to address these issues. These amendments would not touch funding for the Iron Dome and other purely defensive systems to protect Israel against incoming missiles.

M. President, as we all know, Hamas – a terrorist organization – began this war with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 innocent men, women, and children and took more than 230 captives, some of whom remain today in captivity.

As I have said many times, Israel has and had the absolute right to defend themselves against this terrorist attack. But Israel did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.

M. President, regarding offensive military aid to Israel, what we will be voting on is pretty simple.

First: has Netanyahu and his government violated U.S. and international law in Gaza – which, if he has, should automatically result in the cessation of all U.S. military aid to Israel? That is a pretty simple question.

Second, and even more importantly: as U.S. taxpayers, do we want to be complicit in Netanyahu’s unprecedented and savage military campaign against the Palestinian people? Do we want to continue providing the weapons and the military aid that is causing this massive destruction? Do we want that war in Gaza to be not only Israel’s war, but America’s war?

On the first question, the legal issue, the answer is clear: Netanyahu and his extremist government are clearly in violation of U.S. and international law and, because of that, should no longer receive U.S. military aid.

International law requires that warring parties facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. That’s international law. Israel has clearly not done that. Only in the last several weeks, after pressure from President Biden, has aid access begun to improve somewhat, though it is still grossly insufficient given the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe.

Maybe more importantly, U.S. law on this subject is extremely clear.  There is no ambiguity. The Foreign Assistance Act says that no U.S. security assistance may be provided to any country that “prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.” That is the law.

Israel is clearly in violation of this law.  For six months, it has severely limited the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. The result has been a catastrophic humanitarian disaster with hundreds of thousands of children facing malnutrition and starvation.

Israel’s violation of this law is not in debate. It is a reality repeatedly confirmed, every day, by numerous humanitarian organizations. Israeli leaders themselves admit it.

M. President at the start of this war, the Israeli defense minister declared a total siege on Gaza, saying, this is the Israeli Defense Minister, “we are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.  There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel. Everything is closed.” And they kept their word on that.

In January, Netanyahu himself said that Israel is only allowing in the absolute minimum amount of aid.

For months, thousands of trucks carrying life-saving supplies have sat just miles away from starving children – trucks with food miles away from children who are starving.  And Israel has kept these trucks from reaching people in desperate need.

Israel’s blockade pushed the United States to extreme measures, including air-dropping supplies and the construction of an emergency pier, in order to get food to starving people. The President and the United States did the right thing – children are starving, and we are trying to air drop aid and build a pier.  In other words, we’re now in the absurd situation where Israel is using U.S. military assistance to block the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid to Palestinians.

If that is not crazy, I do not know what is. But it is also a clear violation of U.S. law.

Given this reality, we shouldn’t today even be having this debate. It’s illegal to continue current military aid to Israel, let alone send another $9 billion with no strings attached.

M. President, let me take a moment to describe what is happening in Gaza right now, to further explain why these amendments are absolutely necessary and why we must end U.S. complicity in Netanyahu’s war in Gaza.

M. President, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed and 77,000 wounded since this war began – seventy percent of whom are women and children. Seventy percent of whom are women and children. That means five percent of the 2.2 million residents of Gaza have been killed or wounded in six-and-a-half months.

Five percent of the entire population in six-and-a-half months have been killed or wounded. That is a staggering, rather unbelievable number.

19,000 children in Gaza are now orphans. 19,000 children are orphans having lost their parents in this war. And I might add, for the children of Gaza the psychic damage that has been done to them will never cease in their lives. They have witnessed – little kids, Gaza is a young community a lot of children – they have witnessed unbelievable carnage, destruction of houses. They have experienced hunger, thirst. They have been thrown out of their homes. What is being done to the children – many hundreds of thousands of children –is unforgivable.

And the killing has not stopped. Over the weekend, 139 Palestinians were killed and 251 injured. Of these, 29 were killed in and around Rafah, including 20 children and six women, one of whom was pregnant.

M. President, roughly 1.7 million people – over 75 percent of the population – have been driven from their homes in Gaza.  Satellite data shows that 62 percent of homes in Gaza have been either damaged or destroyed, including 221,000 housing units that have been completely destroyed. 221,000 housing units completely destroyed. That’s more than one million people made homeless by Israeli bombing.

M. President, it’s not only housing. It is Gaza’s entire civilian infrastructure that has been devastated. In Gaza today there is no electricity, apart from generators or solar power, and most roads are badly damaged. More than half of the water and sanitation systems are out of commission. Clean drinking water is severely limited, and sewage is running through the streets, spreading disease.

M. President, Israel has not only destroyed the housing stock in Gaza, not only destroyed the infrastructure, they have systematically destroyed the health care system in Gaza.  26 out of 37 hospitals are completely out of service in a country that now has tens and tens of thousands of people who are now sick and wounded.  Eleven hospitals are partially functioning, but they are overwhelmed by many, many people who are sick and injured. And they are all short on medical supplies.  Doctors have had to perform countless surgeries without anesthesia or antibiotics.  Only three hospitals are now providing maternal care in Gaza, where 180 women are giving birth every day. Overall, 84 percent of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed in Gaza, and more than 400 health care workers have been killed.

But it is not only housing that has been destroyed, not only the infrastructure, not only the health care system. M. President, the education system has collapsed, with 56 schools destroyed and 219 damaged. The last of Gaza’s universities was demolished in January.  Some 625,000 students now have no access to education.

M. President, I really do not understand what the military utility of destroying a university is.

M. President, above and beyond the destruction of homes; the destruction of the infrastructure; the destruction of the health care system; the destruction of schools, universities, and the educational system; unbelievably, there is something even worse now taking place in Gaza: and that is that more than one million Palestinians, including hundreds of thousands of children, face starvation. People in Gaza are foraging for leaves, they are eating animal feed, or surviving off the occasional aid package. At least 28 children have already died of malnutrition and dehydration. And the real number is likely much higher, but without sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza, it’s impossible to know. Recently, USAID Administrator Samantha Power said that famine was already present in northern Gaza.

Without food, clean water, sanitation, or sufficient healthcare, hundreds of thousands of people are at severe risk from dehydration, infection, and easily preventable diseases.

M. President, I keep hearing discussion from the pundits and the experts about the “day after in Gaza,” when the war is over – but what kind of day after can there be amidst this incredible destruction? Gaza today can barely sustain human life.

M. President, Hamas started this war. And that is true. But this war stopped being about defending Israel a long time ago.  What is going on now is the destruction of the very fabric of Palestinian life.

It is impossible to look at these facts and not conclude that the Israeli government’s policy has been, quite deliberately, to make Gaza uninhabitable for Palestinians.

And, clearly, there are powerful voices in Israel’s extreme, right-wing government who have been quite open about their desire to drive the Palestinian people out of both Gaza and the West Bank.

This is not the Israel of Golda Meir. Netanyahu’s government is beholden to outright racists and religious fanatics who believe they have exclusive right to dominate the land.

M. President, that is why we must end our complicity in this terrible war. That is why we should support the amendment I am offering to end unfettered military aid to the Netanyahu’s war machine.

Let’s be clear: cutting military aid to Netanyahu’s government is not just my view.  It’s what American people believe and are demanding.

The American people, in fact, are fed up with Netanyahu and his war.

They do not want to see their taxpayer dollars support the slaughter of innocent civilians and the starvation of children. A recent Gallup poll showed that just 36% of Americans approve of Israel’s military action, with 55% disapproving. A Quinnipiac poll showed that U.S. voters oppose sending more military aid to Israel by 52% to 39. An earlier YouGov poll also showed that 52% of Americans said that the United States should stop sending weapons to Israel until it stops its attacks in Gaza.

Maybe, and here’s a very radical idea, maybe it’s time for Congress to listen to the American people. And I would urge strong support for my amendment.

M. President, my second amendment would remove the ban on funding for UNRWA, a UN organization with 30,000 employees that is delivering essential humanitarian aid in Gaza and supporting basic services in other neighboring countries, including Jordan.  Millions of people rely on those services.

Israel has said that 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7th terrorist attack.

These are serious charges – obviously any involvement with Hamas by UNRWA employees is unacceptable. That is why every year UNRWA provides Israel with a list of its staff and goes to great lengths to cooperate with Israeli authorities.  UNRWA learned about Israel’s accusations from the media, and immediately fired the accused employees, while the UN launched an investigation.

Thus far, Israel has refused to cooperate with the UN investigation. I should add, importantly, that most donors have restored funding to UNRWA and are satisfied by the agency’s protocols to ensure independence from Hamas.

The U.S. National Intelligence Council, meanwhile, said that Israel’s claims were plausible but could not be confirmed, and noted that Israel has tried to undermine UNRWA for years. In the last six months, Israel has harassed UNRWA employees, blocked shipments of supplies including medicines, frozen its bank accounts, and killed 181 UN staff.

M. President, UNRWA plays a critical role both in Gaza and across the region.  Whatever the investigation shows in the end, it is my view that you don’t deny humanitarian aid to millions of people because of the alleged actions of twelve UNRWA employees out of a workforce of 30,000.

And by the way, Mr. President, when we talk about investigations, maybe, just maybe, we should not just be talking about UNRWA. Maybe we should also investigate what’s going on in the West Bank. Last weekend, after an Israeli teenager was killed, large groups of armed Israeli settlers, vigilantes, rampaged through seventeen villages, shooting dozens of people and burning homes.  Israeli soldiers watched the attacks unfold, doing nothing to stop them.  No arrests have been announced. Maybe we need an investigation there as well.

This past weekend, the Israeli military killed 14 more Palestinians in the West Bank. An ambulance driver was shot and killed as he tried to recover people wounded in another violent attack by Israeli settlers.

Since October 7th, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed more than 470 Palestinians in the West Bank, including more than 100 children.

But for some reason, I don’t know why, I just don’t hear my colleagues calling for an investigation of that.

M. President, we are in a critical moment. Not just in terms of what is happening in Gaza, but in many ways what is happening right here in America and what is happening here in the U.S. Senate. Given the fact that a majority of the American people now want to stop funding for Netanyahu’s war machine, I find it incomprehensible that we are not going to be able to vote on that issue. I find it outrageous that, at a time when Netanyahu’s government has clearly broken the law, members of this Congress, members of the Senate are not going to be able to vote as to whether or not they want to continue providing billions more of unfettered military aid to Netanyahu’s war machine.

So, M. President, I would hope that we will have the decency to allow a little bit of democracy here in the United States Senate. I would hope that we allow the members to vote on some of these very, very important issues. And I certainly hope that we will pass these amendments.

Thank you and I yield.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Joins President Biden to Announce $7 Billion for Solar for All
Date: April 22, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 22 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today joined President Biden to announce an unprecedented $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program – legislation which Sanders wrote. They also announced the creation of a Vermont Climate Corps; Vermont is now one of only thirteen states with such a program.

The Solar for All program will provide loans or grants to working class families to help cover the cost of installing solar rooftops or participating in community-based solar projects. This $7 billion investment will save working families more than $8.7 billion in electric bills over the lifetime of the installed panels. Families for whom the start-up costs have been prohibitive will now have the support they need to invest in solar panels.

Vermont will receive $62.45 million in residential solar funding from the Solar for All program.

“The United States can and must lead the world in transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuels,” said Sanders. “The Solar for All program – that I successfully championed – will not only combat the existential threat of climate change by making solar energy available to working class families, it will also substantially lower the electric bills of Americans and create thousands of good-paying jobs. This is a win for the environment, a win for consumers, and a win for the economy.”

The Vermont Climate Corps – a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience – will mobilize young Americans who are ready to take on the existential threat of climate change. As one of the first states participating in the American Climate Corps, Vermont will continue to be at the forefront of the fight to take on climate change, creating good paying jobs for young people who are working to save the planet.

Title: NEWS: More Than 130 Students from Across Vermont Join Second-Annual Youth Chess Day
Date: April 22, 2024

BURLINGTON, Vt., April 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Saturday welcomed more than 130 students from across Vermont to his second-annual Youth Chess Day. Held at Vermont State University in Randolph, the event featured a learn-to-play session for students playing chess for the first time, as well as a recreational tournament for experienced players.

Kicking off the event, Sanders stated: “One of the reasons we are holding this second-annual Chess Day is that we want children to exercise and play ball, but we also want you to have smart minds. We want you to learn how to think and to strategize. And chess is a game that has been around for a very, very long time, and it is played all over the world – it’s a universal game. So, what we look forward to today is for you all to compete and enjoy yourselves.”

In his remarks, Sanders thanked all of the parents in attendance, and thanked chess advisors Michelle Sagalchik, Eric Hutchins, Hank Buermeyer, Hayden Collins and the UVM Chess Club, and Zoe Greenwald and the Middlebury College Chess Club.

Ada, an 8th grader who attended the event, said: “I came out here today because having a competition like this is a great way to build a chess community and meet other kids that play chess.” Her favorite part of chess is that “each new match you get to know a lot about the game and meet new friends, and it’s a really fun game to play.”

Hollis, a 6th grade chess player, said: “My favorite part about chess is being able to think and strategizing.” Hollis said chess “is good to develop your brain and helps you think.” He hopes to see more chess events in Vermont in the future.

Michael, a parent who brought his kids to Chess Day, said: “My family is here to continue a tradition that was started last year. It is a tremendous opportunity for young people in Vermont to learn the game of chess. It provides them with many skills and abilities that are crucial in life.”

The “Learn-To-Play” session was open to students grades 1-8 who were new to the game, while the recreational tournament was open to more experienced players in grades 1-12. Students with all levels of experience were highly encouraged to attend. Lunch was provided for all students free of charge.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on the Escalation in the Middle East
Date: April 15, 2024
Subtitle:

WASHINGTON, April 15 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement regarding the recent attacks by Iran and Israel amidst the humanitarian crisis in Palestine:I condemn Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend and am grateful there was no loss of life. I also condemn the reckless Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus two weeks ago, which killed seven Iranians and escalated an already tense regional situation. Cooler heads must now prevail to ensure peace in the region and security for Israel. President Biden is right to make it clear that the United States will not be drawn into another disastrous war in the Middle East.In the midst of growing Middle East tension, we cannot ignore for a moment Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people. Today, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children face starvation as Israel continues to block urgent humanitarian aid that is desperately needed. Humanitarian organizations continue to report unacceptable Israeli restrictions, which prevent many aid convoys from reaching people in need. Further, in response to the tragic death of an Israeli teenager, Israeli settler vigilantes rampaged through the West Bank over the last three days, killing four people and burning numerous buildings. Israeli soldiers and settlers have now killed some 460 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7th. In Gaza, 163 Palestinians were killed over the weekend.The United States must use all of its leverage to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and across the region, and demand that the massive amount of humanitarian aid that is needed to prevent famine and widespread humanitarian suffering is able to flow into Gaza. The United States cannot continue to provide billions of dollars to Netanyahu’s reckless and inhumane war machine.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Ensure Corporations Finally Pay Their Fair Share in Taxes
Date: April 10, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 10 – As millions of Americans prepare to file their taxes ahead of the federal deadline on April 15, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today introduced legislation to ensure that large corporations are finally required to pay their fair share. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would stop corporations from sheltering profits in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, eliminate tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, and close loopholes in the tax code that allow corporations to get away with paying little to nothing in taxes.

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, closing corporate use of offshore tax havens would raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. This legislation would also roll back the Trump corporate tax rate cut and restore the top rate to 35 percent – a move that would raise an additional $1.3 trillion over 10 years.

Sanders is joined by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has companion legislation in the House.

“At a time of massive wealth and income inequality and soaring corporate profits, it is an outrage that many large, profitable corporations continue to pay little to nothing in federal income taxes,”said Sanders.“As working people struggle to pay rent and put food on the table, we have a corrupt and rigged tax code that is designed to benefit the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of working families. Meanwhile, Republicans would make a bad situation even worse by providing even more tax breaks to their corporate campaign contributors and the billionaire class while proposing massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That is unacceptable. We need to create an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the top one percent. And, one of the ways we can begin to do that is by making sure that large corporations pay their fair share of taxes. American workers should not be paying more in federal income taxes, in a given year, than profitable companies like Target, Amazon and T-Mobile.”

“We live in the richest country in the world at the richest moment in history, yet many Americans are unable to feel the magnitude of our wealth. One of the biggest problems we face is income inequality. As big corporations continue to rake in record profits, there are many families struggling to put food on the table,”said Schakowsky.“Thanks to President Joe Biden, we are growing the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, but we must go even further by passing the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act to help put the interests of everyday Americans ahead of billionaires and transnational corporations. I thank Senator Sanders for devoting his career to tackling income inequality and am proud to partner with him on this important measure.”

Despiterecord breaking profits, many of the largest and most profitable corporations in the United States continue to paylittle to nothingin taxes. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would build on the important progress made by the Inflation Reduction Act in reversing corporate tax breaks – which included a 15 percent minimum tax on large corporations that will raise $222 billion over the next 10 years. Sanders’ legislation would go well beyond this by entirely shutting down offshore tax avoidance and restoring the top corporate tax rate to 35 percent – where it was before Trump became president. Together, these policies will raise more than $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years.

According to a study from the Government Accountability Office (GAO),34 percentof large profitable corporations paid nothing in federal income taxes during the first year that the Trump tax cuts went into effect. Overall, the study found that large, profitable American corporations on average paid less than 9 percent of their profits in federal income taxes in 2018. Another study found that 109 large profitable corporationspaid zerofederal income tax in at least one of the last five years. For example, any American worker who paid a single dollar in income taxes, paid more than the below companies paid in corporate incomes taxes:

How do companies get away with paying little to nothing in taxes? The biggest loophole in the corporate tax code is the one allowing corporations to pay a lower or even zero percent tax rate on profits stashed in tax havens. This loophole explains why American corporations report 59 percent of theiroffshore profitsin tax havens and the absurd situation where one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is “home” to about 20,000 corporations.

The collapse in corporate revenue is notable both in the U.S. and internationally. The corporate tax used to represent about 30 percent of total revenues to the federal government in the 1950s, but that number is now down to just9 percentin 2023. Similarly, U.S. corporate tax revenue as a percentage of the economy isone of the lowestamong major economies and half the level of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (OECD) average.

This would change under the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act. In addition to putting an end to offshore tax havens and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and factories overseas, this legislation would reform the tax code by:

The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act has been endorsed by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), a coalition of more than 420 national, state, and local organizations.

“The global tax system has long allowed corporations to avoid paying their full amount in domestic taxes by shifting their profits overseas to tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda,” said David Kass, Executive Director for Americans for Tax Fairness. “The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would remove incentives for offshoring of American factories and jobs by equalizing the tax rates between foreign and domestic profits – and make corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”

Title: NEWS: Senator Bernie Sanders and President Joe Biden Hold Event at the White House to Discuss Lowering Health Care Costs in America
Date: April 3, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), today joined President Joe Biden at the White House for an event on their work to lower health care costs for the American people.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and the full event can bewatched live here:

Our nation is politically divided. Nobody doubts that.But there is one issue that the American people, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, conservative or progressive, are united on – and that is we are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.On average, we pay over 3 times as much as other major countries for brand name prescription drugs, and, in some cases we pay 10 or 20 times more than the people of other countries for the same exact product.  Meanwhile, ten top drug companies made over $110 billion in profits last year, and pay their CEOs tens of millions of dollars in compensation.The result of the high cost of prescription drug costs is obvious.  One out of four Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescriptions their doctors write and some die as a result. Others get much sicker than they should, and end up in emergency rooms or hospitals at great expense to our already bloated healthcare system.Further, the very high cost of prescription drugs is not just an individual patient issue.  It is a taxpayer issue.  It drives up the cost of Medicaid, Medicare and other public health programs as well as private insurance.The truth is that politicians have been talking about the high cost of prescription drugs for years – including me.  I’ve been on this issue for at least 20 years, maybe more.  But during that time not much has happened.  A lot of talk YES, but no real progress.  The drug companies continued to charge us any price they wanted, for any reason.Well, here is some good news.  Despite all of the wealth and political power of the pharmaceutical industry, despite their more than 1,800 paid lobbyists on Capitol Hill, the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress are beginning to make some progress. What have we done over the last few years?As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act that not one single Republican voted for:

The Biden Administration has also taken executive action to make sure that when American taxpayer dollars help fund the development of certain tests, treatments and vaccines to deal with public health emergencies pharmaceutical companies must charge reasonable prices for those products.And that’s not all.In December, the Biden administration proposed that if a drug made using taxpayer funds is not reasonably available to Americans because of its exorbitant price, the government reserves the right to allow a low-cost manufacturer to sell the product for a fraction of the price.The President called this “an important step toward ending Big Pharma price gouging.”I agree, and I look forward to the Biden administration implementing this provision to substantially reduce prescription drug prices.I am also proud of the accomplishments the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which I chair, has made to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.Less than 3 months ago, the HELP Committee launched an investigation into the outrageously high price of inhalers that 25 million Americans with asthma and 16 million Americans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) need to breathe.And what we learned is that the American people were paying, in many cases, 10-70 times more for inhalers than the people in Canada and Europe.After talking to the CEOs of the 4 major inhaler manufacturers, three of them have made a commitment to cap the cost of all of their brand name inhalers – Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline.Teva, the smallest of the 4 companies that manufacture inhalers has not made that commitment.  We hope they will in the very near future.Within a short period of time, the vast majority of Americans will pay no more than $35 at the pharmacy counter for the inhalers they purchase.A Vermont resident recently told my office that she has to pay $320 per month for Boehringer Ingelheim’s Spiriva HandiHaler. As a result of these decisions, she could save more than $3,000 a year on the inhaler that she needs to breathe.  Millions of others will enjoy similar benefits.My impression is that these companies, as well as many others in the pharmaceutical industry, are beginning to catch on to the fact that the American people are tired of being ripped off and paying astronomical prices for the prescription drugs they need to stay alive or ease their suffering.Let me also take this moment to thank Lina Khan, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission for taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.Last November, the FTC challenged how drug companies manipulate and play games with patents to keep low-cost generic drugs off the market – including asthma inhalers.  By standing up to the drug companies, the FTC has helped deliver this major victory for the American people.And it’s not just inhalers.Last year, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that his company would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket.In a separate HELP Committee hearing last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products after announcing very substantial price cuts for these products.These efforts will improve life for millions of Americans. They will prevent unnecessary deaths, ease suffering and save substantial sums of money for working class families.But, despite all that we’ve accomplished, it is not enough.  Much more has to be done.In his State of the Union address, President Biden called on Congress to pass legislation to cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for all Americans at no more than $2,000 a year and to substantially increase the number of drugs that can be negotiated with the pharmaceutical industry.  I strongly agree with him.As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I intend to introduce legislation to do just that.In my view, we can no longer tolerate companies like Novo Nordisk charging the American people some $1,000 a month for Ozempic – a drug that costs less than $5 to manufacture – when that exact same product can be purchased in Germany for $59.We can no longer tolerate Astellas and Pfizer charging Americans with prostate cancer over $165,000 for Xtandi when that exact same product can be purchased for just $20,000 in Japan.Even more disturbing is the reality that over half of the new drugs coming onto the market today cost $300,000, while a number of them actually cost over $1 million.  This is an issue that we must get a handle on.Working together, we can take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower the price of prescription drugs in America.  And, when we do that, we will be lowering the cost of health care in America which is far, far too high.I thank President Biden for what he has done on this issue up to now, and look forward to working with the President as we go forward.And now I’d like to introduce Kris Garcia from Littleton, Colorado. Even though Mr. Garcia has health insurance through his employer, he and family cannot afford the outrageous price of his medications. Mr. Garcia has asthma and several bleeding disorders and relies on multiple inhalers and specialty drugs to stay alive. Even with insurance, the copays for his inhalers and other medications total more than $450 per month. He has been paying $163 per month for just one inhaler, Advair, and starting soon, Mr. Garcia will be able to get Advair for $35 a month.Thank you, Mr. Garcia.

Title: NEWS: Vermont Congressional Delegation Statement on the U.S. Postal Service Signing a New Lease to Restore Montpelier Post Office
Date: April 1, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., April 1 – Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Representative Becca Balint (VT-AL) today issued the following joint statement:

“After eight long months, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has finally signed a lease on a new home for Montpelier’s post office after the devastating floods displaced their downtown location last summer. This is an important step in the right direction and as a Delegation we welcome this news. We were proud to work with the people of Montpelier, advocates, and community and state leaders to ensure the return of a fully operational post office to our state’s capital and its community.

“While this lease is good news, the failure of USPS leadership to address this matter in a safe, timely, and transparent manner remains unacceptable and emblematic of a nationwide crisis made worse by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. It should not take the better part of a year, heroic grassroots efforts, and constant work by the Delegation and state leaders for Postmaster General DeJoy to do his job – especially after a catastrophic natural disaster.

“The USPS provides essential services that individuals, families, small businesses, and older Vermonters alike rely on every day. They need a functional USPS not only to mail letters and packages, but for the delivery of important documents like their Social Security checks, the delivery of lifesaving prescription drugs, and to pay their bills on time. This is especially true in rural areas. We strongly urge the Postmaster General and the USPS Board of Governors to focus on restoring the trust that both Vermonters and the American people have had for generations in the postal service, and immediately address any remaining lapses in service.

“In the meantime, we will continue the fight to restore reliable postal service for our communities and safe and fair working conditions for our postal workers, in Montpelier and across the state.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Outrageous Cost of Ozempic
Date: March 27, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 27 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Wednesday called on Novo Nordisk to lower the list price of Ozempic and issued the following statement afterthe release of a new study, which found that the diabetes and weight-loss drug could be profitably produced for less than $5 a month.Sanders said:Today, a new Yale study found that Ozempic costs less than $5 a month to manufacture. And yet, Novo Nordisk charges Americans nearly $1,000 a month for this drug, while the same exact product can be purchased for just $155 a month in Canada and just $59 in Germany.As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), I am calling on Novo Nordisk to lower the list price of Ozempic – and the related drug Wegovy – in America to no more than what they charge for this drug in Canada. The American people are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while the pharmaceutical industry enjoys huge profits.As a result of a major grassroots movement, Novo Nordisk did the right thing by recently reducing the price of its insulin products by some 75% in America. Novo Nordisk, a company that made nearly $15 billion in profits last year, must now do the right thing with respect to Ozempic and Wegovy.Ozempic has the potential to be a game changer in the diabetes and obesity epidemics in America. But, if we do not substantially reduce the price of this drug, millions who need it will be unable to afford it. Further, this outrageously high price has the potential to bankrupt Medicare, the American people and our entire health care system.We cannot allow that to happen. A prescription drug is not safe or effective for a patient who cannot afford it.The HELP Committee will do everything that it can to make sure that the American people no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Title: NEWS: Sanders on State Department’s Statement that Israel Has Not Restricted Humanitarian Aid to Gaza
Date: March 25, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday released the following statement regarding the State Department’s statement that Israel is in compliance with U.S. law, international humanitarian law, and the Biden Administration’s recentNational Security Memorandum. The State Department today stated: “We have found them not to be in violation, either when it comes to conduct of the war or the provision of humanitarian assistance.”Sanders said:32,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed and almost 75,000 injured, two-thirds of whom are women and children. Some 60% of the housing units have been damaged or destroyed, and almost all medical facilities have been made inoperable. Today, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children are facing starvation because Netanyahu won’t let in sufficient humanitarian aid, while thousands of trucks are waiting to get into Gaza. To pretend that Israel is not violating international law or interfering with U.S. humanitarian aid is absurd on its face. The State Department’s position makes a mockery of U.S. law and assurances provided to Congress.

WASHINGTON, March 23 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement regarding his NO vote on the appropriations package passed in the Senate last night:

I voted NO on the appropriations bill that the Senate passed last night. While hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children face starvation in Gaza, this bill actually prohibits funding to UNRWA, the key United Nations aid agency delivering life-saving humanitarian support. This will only intensify the already horrific situation in Gaza. This bill also provides another $3.3 billion in U.S. military aid for Netanyahu’s right-wing government to continue this barbaric war. The Netanyahu government should not receive another penny from U.S. taxpayers.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Finally Guarantee Paid Vacation to U.S. Workers
Date: March 22, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, Pensions (HELP) Committee, this week introduced legislation that would ensure that the United States finally joins virtually every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing workers the right to earn paid annual vacation leave. This legislation comes just a week after Sanders introducedlegislationand held a HELP Committeehearingon establishing a 32-hour workweek in America with no loss in pay.Sanders is joined on the Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) while Rep. Seth Magaziner (RI-02) introduced companion legislation in the House.“It is time to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid vacation days to workers,”said Sen. Sanders.“We hear a lot of talk about family values in America, but let’s be clear: When a husband, wife, and kids, during the course of an entire year, are unable to spend any time together on vacation, that is not a family value.  That is an attack on everything that a family is supposed to stand for. It’s not a radical idea to require companies in America to provide at least two weeks of paid vacation to their workers. What’s radical is that millions of Americans are not only working longer hours for lower wages, but that they do not receive a single paid vacation day in the year 2024. That should not be happening in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world.”“Americans who put in an honest day’s work deserve to take time off, and I’m proud to introduce the House companion to this legislation to make this a reality for all,”said Rep. Magaziner.“This is a matter of fairness and respect in the workplace. No one works harder than American workers, and they have earned a break.”While millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the U.S. remains the only major economy in the world to not guarantee some type of paid vacation time to its people. Today in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many countries in Europe, workers are guaranteed at least 10 days of paid vacation. In other countries, such as France, Austria, and Belgium, paid vacation benefits are even stronger.Meanwhile in the U.S., nearly40 percentof workers are on the job at least 50 hours a week and a staggering18 percentare clocking at least 60 hours a week, as of 2019. The average full-time worker in the U.S. now works42 hoursa week – an estimate that does not necessarily account for those working multiple jobs. On top of this, more than8 millionAmericans work multiple jobs, with4.7 millionworking a second part-time job on top of a full-time job. The American worker does all of this without a federal guarantee of earned paid vacation time.If passed, the Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act would ensure that:

According to a recentstudy, the benefits of taking time off from work include higher productivity, greater employee retention, increased workplace morale, and significant health benefits.Lack of paid time off has a significant negative impact on not only the employee, but the society as a whole. Astudyby Oxford Economics found benefits of taking time off from work include higher productivity, greater employee retention, increased workplace morale, and significant health benefits.The study also found that when people take time off, the economy benefits. For example, if employees who already get time off took the full amount they were eligible for, the economy would benefit from more than $160 billion in total business sales, $21 billion in tax revenues, and 1.2 million additional jobs would be supported in industries like retail and manufacturing.The Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act is endorsed by the Center for Law and Social Policy, Economic Opportunity Institute, Economic Policy Institute, Family Equality, Family Values @ Work, MomsRising, Mothering Justice, NAACP, National Employment Law Project, National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women’s Law Center, Oxfam America, Paid Leave for All, SEIU (Service Employees International Union), SMART (International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers), UnidosUS, UNITE HERE, Women Employed, and ZERO TO THREE.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez Reintroduce Green New Deal for Public Housing Act
Date: March 21, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 21 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) today reintroduced essential legislation that would take on the affordable housing crisis and the existential threat of climate change. The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act invests up to $234 billion over ten years to transition the entire public housing stock in the United States into zero-carbon, highly energy-efficient homes – dramatically improving living conditions for nearly 2 million people in public housing across the country. The legislation alsocreatesup to 280,000 good-paying, union jobs per year, while reducing annual carbon emissions by roughly 5.7 million metric tons – the equivalent of taking over 1.26 million cars off the road.Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are joined on the legislation by 55 members in the House of Representatives and 7 senators including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).“In these difficult times, we must move forward boldly to address the systemic and existential crises facing us today and that includes urgently combating climate change and making sure every American has a safe and decent place to call home,”said Sen. Sanders.“It is unacceptable that, on a single given night in America, over 650,000 people are homeless. It is unacceptable that, in the richest country in the history of the world, people are choosing between paying rent and putting food on the table. It is unacceptable that our nation’s public housing is in a state of chronic disrepair and energy inefficiency after generations of government neglect. It is unacceptable that we have not done more to transform our energy systems, our communities, and our infrastructure away from fossils fuels and toward renewable energy. This legislation is a major step in the right direction, and I am proud to partner with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez in introducing it today.”“Years of grassroots organizing on behalf of vulnerable Americans led to the creation of the first federal public housing units but for decades the federal government has allowed our limited public housing stock to fall into disrepair. Residents are dealing with mold growth, lead-based paint hazards, lack of central cooling and heating, failing water infrastructure, and numerous other safety concerns. It is beyond time for the federal government to take responsibility and pass legislation that offers comprehensive, public solutions,”said Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.“The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act will allow for an increase in public housing units, create an estimated 280,000 jobs, and invest up to $23 billion a year over ten years for highly energy-efficient developments. This will produce on-site renewable energy, expand workforce capacity, and focus on community development. Every American deserves to live in a safe, vibrant, and environmentally conscious community – including public housing residents. I am confident this legislation is how we make that a reality.”Today, the U.S. faces a deepening climate and housing crisis, and public housing is burdened by government neglect, racial injustice, and chronic disrepair, including a $70 billion maintenance backlog. Residents of public housing often suffer worse health outcomes due to mold infestations, lead contamination, poor indoor air quality, and unsafe temperatures. Low-income households on average spend 8.6 percent of their total income on energy costs compared to 3 percent for other households – often forcing the choice between paying energy bills or other essential expenses like food, medicine, and child care.Additionally, about 11.3 million American households are severely cost-burdened from paying more than 50 percent of their income on housing. Alarmingly, there are currently no states in the country where a full-time worker earning the federal minimum wage can afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.With its focus on transforming over 900,000 units of public housing, the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act would take on the housing and climate crises in a number of ways including by:

“In the five years since its introduction, Green New Deal advocacy has catapulted environmental justice to the top of the national agenda, helped deliver historic victories, and charted a course for a better future,”said Sen. Markey.“The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act sets forward a plan to make housing safer, more sustainable, and more affordable, while creating good, green jobs along the way. By improving the living conditions for people living in public housing and making more public housing available to those who need it, we can tackle the housing crisis and the climate crisis at the same time.”Sen. Welch said:“The climate and affordable housing crises are the two most pressing challenges of our time. Vermont has been hit particularly hard by both–we have the second-highest homelessness rate in the country, and last summer’s brutal floods left communities devastated. Vermonters urgently need solutions that provide them with a roof over their heads and the resources necessary to be more resilient. This bill tackles both challenges head-on by modernizing public housing with clean, renewable energy features that strengthen communities’ climate resilience, and upgrading public housing so that everyone has a clean and safe place to call home.”“Everyone deserves a safe, decent place to call home, and bold federal investments in public housing can be a win-win for our communities and environment,”said Sen. Merkley.“The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act tackles the dual crises of climate chaos and housing unaffordability by upgrading millions of federal public housing units. With this landmark investment in our future, we can create good-paying jobs, improve public health, and reduce carbon pollution.”Said Sen. Warren:“We are in the middle of a housing crisis and a climate crisis, and we need bold federal investments to tackle both. I’m proud to cosponsor the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, which will transition nearly a million public housing units into zero-carbon, energy efficient housing. This legislation will strengthen our nation’s public housing communities, create good-paying green jobs, lower energy and water costs, and take a big whack at cutting our carbon emissions.”“Our public housing infrastructure was not built to handle the increasingly extreme heat and weather conditions our communities are confronting in the face of climate change,”said Sen. Padilla.“This bill will help combat our housing crisis by expanding access to affordable public housing while prioritizing energy-efficient and climate-resilient development.”“This legislation is a critical step towards addressing both our climate crisis and the urgent need for affordable housing,”said Sen. Booker.“The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act not only creates quality, sustainable homes but also generates thousands of jobs in low-income communities across the nation. Investing in zero-carbon public housing will serve as a blueprint for how our country can both combat climate change and make meaningful investments in communities most in need.”“This measure aims to ensure every American has an affordable and safe place to live. As climate change exacerbates problems of homelessness and hardworking Americans struggle to afford a place to live, we must tackle these issues strategically and holistically,”said Sen. Blumenthal.“By investing in housing and energy-efficient improvements, this bill will help provide homes for millions of people and create union jobs.”The legislation is endorsed by more than 70 organizations including American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), National Housing Law Project, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), National Health Care for the Homeless Council, Center for Popular Democracy Action, National Homelessness Law Center, Movement For Black Lives, Alliance for Housing Justice, People’s Action/Homes Guarantee Campaign, MoveOn, National Domestic Workers Alliance, Care in Action, United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 9A, Green New Deal Network, Sunrise Movement, Public Citizen, NextGen America, Make The Road New York, and Care In Action.Read the bill summary,here.Read the bill text,here.Read the section-by-section,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Applauds GlaxoSmithKline for Capping Inhaler Costs at $35 Per Month
Date: March 20, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Wednesday issued the following statement after GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the largest manufacturer of inhaler products in the United States, announced that it would cap out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month for its asthma and COPD inhalers no later than January 1, 2025. These products include: Advair Diskus, Advair HFA, Anoro Ellipta, Arnuity Ellipta, Breo Ellipta, Incruse Ellipta, Serevent Diskus, Trelegy Ellipta, and Ventolin HFA.Chairman Sanders said:As Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I very much appreciate GlaxoSmithKline’s announcement today that Americans throughout the country with asthma and COPD will pay no more than $35 for the brand name inhalers they manufacture. I look forward to working with GSK to make sure that this decision reaches as many patients as possible.GlaxoSmithKline’s announcement today follows the recent decisions of Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca to also cap the cost of their inhalers at $35.With today’s announcement, the three largest manufacturers of inhalers in the world have all committed to cap the cost of inhalers in the United States at no more than $35 at the pharmacy counter. This will significantly cut costs for millions of Americans with asthma and COPD so that they will be able to afford the inhalers they need.In January, the HELP Committee launched an investigation into the outrageously high cost of inhalers that 25 million Americans with asthma and 16 million Americans with COPD rely on to breathe. In my view, Americans who have asthma and COPD should not be forced to pay, in many cases, 10 to 70 times more for the same exact inhalers as patients in Europe and other parts of the world.The Senate HELP Committee will continue to do everything we can do to make sure that Americans no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Doggett, Schakowsky and 9 Colleagues Send Bicameral Letter to Biden Calling for Equitable Access Standards as WHO Seeks to Address Future Pandemics
Date: March 19, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 19 – As the United States participates this week in negotiations at the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish the Pandemic Accord, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Committee Subcommittee on Health, and Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce, along with nine of their colleagues, today called on President Biden to champion strong, binding, equitable access standards for new tests, treatments, and vaccines in the international agreement.Sanders, Doggett, and Schakowsky were joined on the bicameral letter by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), as well as Reps. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.).“We must act on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote the members. “Nearly 15 million people died during the first two years of the pandemic. Most tragically, millions of people died needlessly after the vaccines were developed, but before they became widely available in low-and-middle income countries. Major manufacturers chose not to share the vaccine recipe to expand global production. As a result, it took over a year after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were first authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for enough doses to reach developing countries—if they could afford them at all.”Vaccine inequity hurt the American people as well. According to one study byYale researchers, by the time the U.S. recorded one million deaths, over 40% of those deaths were caused by three COVID-19 variants first detected outside of the U.S.In the letter, the members urged President Biden to push for the inclusion of three commitments in the WHO’s Pandemic Accord: a “fair pricing” requirement for drugs developed for public health emergencies; a technology sharing standard to help expand production of tests, treatments, and vaccines during shortages; and a commitment to support countries that take steps to increase access to pandemic products.The members wrote: “The Pandemic Accord negotiations at the WHO present an historic opportunity to prepare for future pandemics, to protect lives and livelihoods, and to demonstrate political leadership the world will long remember…A fairer, more equitable response to the next public health outbreak is in everyone’s interest. By supporting strong, binding equitable access standards, you can help make sure the next pandemic is shorter and less deadly than the last.”First initiated in December 2021, negotiations over the Pandemic Accord – an international agreement under the WHO constitution aimed at strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response – are targeted to conclude May 2024.Founded in 1948, the WHO is an agency of the United Nations dedicated to act as a coordinating authority on international health issues, including global public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, the U.S. has acted as one of thelargestfunders of the WHO, providing hundreds of millions of dollars annually over the last decade. While the Trump Administration suspended U.S. support for the WHO in 2020 and initiated a withdrawal of U.S. membership, President Biden reversed this effort upon taking office. The U.S. remains a WHO member state today.Read the full letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Secures More Than $42.5 Million for Vermont Communities in Senate Appropriations Bill
Date: March 18, 2024

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., March 18 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Monday that he secured more than $42.5 million in federal funding on behalf of 36 Vermont projects that address critical needs across the state, including in affordable housing, child care, infrastructure, clean energy and water, and rural development.The funding for Sanders’ Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) projects was included in the first package of the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations bills that passed the U.S. Senate on Friday, March 8 and was signed into law by President Biden the following day. The $460 billion package was passed in time to avoid a government shutdown of many key federal agencies.“Through this process, I am always glad to work with Vermonters across our state to identify and secure funding for critical projects that would have a real and positive benefit for our communities,” said Sanders. “In these difficult times, too many have lost hope that government is listening to what they need and taking real action on their behalf. I was proud to see these projects through the Senate and look forward to seeing them have a real, meaningful impact in Vermont communities and in the daily lives of Vermonters across our state – as quickly as possible.”Sanders continued, “Not only is it good news that this federal funding is coming to Vermont – the other good news is that we’re not done yet. That is because this money that we’re discussing today is just the first six funding bills. We have more bills to pass when we return to Washington this week.”The funding package includes: $2,500,000 for manufactured housing throughout Vermont; $2.5 million to install advanced electric meters across the state, which will help manage the delivery of renewable power to Vermonters; $2.3 million to repurpose the Rochester High School building into a multi-use community resource center; and $1.1 million to construct a new emergency services building for the Woodbury Volunteer Fire Department.See below for more details and some highlights on Sanders’ projects.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Applauds AstraZeneca for Capping Inhaler Costs at $35 Per Month
Date: March 18, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 18 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Monday issued the following statement after AstraZeneca announced that it would cap out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month for its asthma and COPD inhalers, starting on June 1, 2024.

The announcement comes on the heels of the January 8 HELP Committeeinvestigation, led by Chairman Sanders and HELP Committee members Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), as to why Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for inhalers.

Earlier this month, Boehringer Ingelheim announced that it would cap patient out-of-pocket costs for all of its inhalers at $35 starting on June 1, 2024. The company also announced that it would lower the list price of some of its inhalers.

Sanders said:

In January, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions that I chair launched an investigation into the outrageously high cost of inhalers that 25 million Americans with asthma and 16 million Americans with COPD rely on to breathe. In my view, Americans who have asthma and COPD should not be forced to pay, in many cases, 10 to 70 times more for the same exact inhalers as patients in Europe and other parts of the world.

Since we launched that investigation, I have had conversations with all of the CEOs of the major manufacturers of these products.

Today, I am very pleased that AstraZeneca has announced that patients in America with commercial insurance and the uninsured or under-insured will pay no more than $35 for the inhalers that they manufacture beginning on June 1st of this year.

This is a very positive step which will help save Americans thousands of dollars a year on the inhalers they need to breathe.

Today, I am calling on the two other major manufacturers of inhalers – GlaxoSmithKline and Teva – to take similar action. If AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim can cap the cost of inhalers at $35 in the United States, these other companies can do the same.

The Senate HELP Committee will continue to do everything we can do to make sure that Americans no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Bernie Sanders Leads HELP Committee Hearing on a 32-Hour Workweek
Date: March 14, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led the committee in a hearing titled, “Workers Should Benefit from New Technology and Increased Productivity: The Need for a 32-Hour Work Week with No Loss in Pay.”Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchhere:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.This morning we are going to talk about an issue that is very rarely discussed in the halls of Congress or in the United States Senate – and that is the need to reduce the standard workweek in America.In fact, the last time, as we understand it, the Senate held a hearing on this subject was in the year1955. So I think maybe the time is now to renew that discussion.At that hearing the Senate heard from Walter Reuther, who was the head of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations – one of the great labor leaders in the history of our country.And this is what Mr. Reuther said: “We fully realize that the potential benefits of automation are great, if properly handled. If only a fraction of what technologists promise for the future is true, within a very few years automation can and should make possible a 4-day workweek … The reduction of the workweek to 35 or 30 hours in the coming decade can be an important shock absorber during the transition to the widespread use of automation. It can both reduce the impact of sharp rises in output and increase the manpower requirements in industry and commerce.”And, yet, today, nearly 70 years later, despite an explosion as we all know in technology and a massive increase in worker productivity, nothing has changed.Think about that. Think about the huge transitions we have seen in the economy, but in terms of the workweek nothing has changed.While we haven’t discussed this issue for a long time in Congress, this is not a new issue.In 1886, one of the central planks of the trade union movement in America was to establish an eight-hour workday with a simple and straightforward demand: “Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what you will.” That was back in 1886.Americans of that era were sick and tired of working 12-hour days for six or seven days a week with very little time for rest, relaxation or quality time with their families. They went out on strike, they organized, they petitioned the government and business owners and they achieved real results after decades of struggle.In 1916, President Wilson signed legislation into law to establish an eight-hour workday for railroad workers.Six years later, the Ford Motor Company became one of the first major employers in America to establish a five-day workweek for autoworkers.And here is something I believe most people in our country do not know: In 1933, the United States Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation to establish a 30-hour workweek by a vote of 53-30. That was 1933.While that legislation ultimately failed as a result of intense opposition from corporate America, a few years later President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act into law and a 40-hour workweek was established in 1940. My friends. In 1940.Unbelievably, 84 years later, despite massive growth in technology and worker productivity, millions of workers in our country are working longer hours for lower wages.And I hope people hear this. Because it is not an issue that we talk about enough. Today in America, 28.5 million Americans – 18% of our workforce – now work over 60 hours a week and 40 percent of employees in America now work at least 50 hours a week. We were talking about a 40-hour workweek 80 years ago, and that is what people today, despite the explosion of technology, are working.The sad reality is, Americans now work more hours than the people of most other wealthy nations. And we’re going to talk about what that means to the lives of ordinary people.In 2022, employees in the United States, and I hope people hear this, logged 204 more hours a year than employees in Japan, and they’re hardworking people in Japan. 279 more hours than workers in the United Kingdom, and 470 more hours than workers in Germany.Despite these long hours, the average worker in America makes almost $50 a week less than he or she did 50 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.Now let that sink in for a moment. Think about all of the extraordinary changes in technology that we seen over the past 50 years – computers, robotics, artificial intelligence – and the huge increase in worker productivity that has been achieved during that time.In factories and warehouses, robots and sophisticated machinery did not exist then or were only used in primitive forms.In grocery stores and shops of all kinds, there were no checkout counters that utilized bar codes.As a result of the extraordinary technological transformations that we have seen in recent years, American workers are now over 400% more productive than they were in the 1940s. Extraordinary. Technology has made working people far more productive.And what has been the result of all of that productivity increase for working people?Almost all of the economic gains of that technological transformation have gone straight to the top, while wages for workers have remained stagnant, or even worse.While CEOs are making nearly 350 times as much as their average employees, workers throughout the country are seeing their family life fall apart as they are forced to spend more and more time at work.They are missing their kids’ birthday parties and little league baseball games. And just the time they need with their family.And what stresses them out even further is that – after spending all of this time at work – many of them still are living paycheck to paycheck, and can’t take of their basic needs.At a moment in history when artificial intelligence and robotics – and I hope we all understand that the jobs that people have today ain’t gonna be there in many cases in 15 years. Our economy is going to be transformed through artificial intelligence and robotics.The question that we are asking today is a pretty simple question – do we continue the trend that technology only benefits the people on top, or that we demand that these transformational changes also benefits working people? And one of these benefits must be a 32-hour workweek.And this is not a radical idea.France, the seventh-largest economy in the world, has a 35-hour work week and is considering reducing it to 32.Norway and Denmark, their workweek is about 37 hours and Belgium has already adopted a 4-day workweek.And what we are going to hear today is there are companies all over our country and all over the world that have adopted the four-day workweek and you know what they have found? They found that productivity actually went up. Because workers were able to focus on their work, they were not exhausted, they were happy to go to work.So the issue that we are talking about today is of enormous importance. Who benefits from the exploding technology? The wealthiest people who are doing phenomenally well or working people who are falling further and further behind?And with that, let me give the mic over to Senator Cassidy.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and 20 Colleagues Send Letter to Postmaster General DeJoy Demanding Protection of Jobs and Mail Delivery
Date: March 13, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), alongside Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Col.), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard “Dick” Durbin (D-Ill.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jacklyn Rosen (D-Nev.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Wednesday sent aletterto Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, urging him to stop any changes to United States Postal Service (USPS) service standards that would result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance, especially in rural states.While the Postal Service claims that its “Mail Processing Facility Reviews” will not result in closures or career employee layoffs, “we are concerned these facility reviews will functionally result in both,” wrote the senators. “In many instances, outgoing mail processing will move hundreds of miles to a regional facility, outside reasonable commuting distance and, in some cases, to another state entirely.” While the Postal Service says that career postal workers will keep their jobs, non-career workers are not protected. Currently, 59 mail processing facilities are under review or recently had their review completed, resulting in job losses and slower mail services for local residents.The Senators noted their concerns about the long distances mail will have to travel and the potential for delayed service in multiple states:

New Hampshire, Wyoming, and Vermont are set to lose all outgoing mail processing from within the state, forcing many career employees to work in other communities.

Americans all over the country — particularly in rural states — depend on reliable and expedient mail service to conduct business, pay their bills, receive medication including lifesaving prescription drugs, get their Social Security checks, and stay in touch with loved ones. For rural communities, the loss of local jobs and even slower mail service represent further setbacks to the revitalization of rural life.

“The Postal Service is at its best when it treats its workers right and delivers mail in a timely fashion,” concluded the senators. “We therefore urge you to prevent facility changes or outright closures that will result in any job losses and slower mail.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Enact a 32-Hour Workweek with No Loss in Pay
Date: March 13, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) today announced that this Thursday he will introduce legislation to establish a standard 32-hour workweek in America with no loss in pay – an important step toward ensuring that workers share in the massive increase in productivity driven by artificial intelligence, automation, and new technology. Sanders is joined on the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act in the Senate by Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) and in the House of Representatives by Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) who introduced companion legislation.“Moving to a 32-hour workweek with no loss of pay is not a radical idea,”said Sen. Sanders.“Today, American workers are over 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. And yet, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than they were decades ago. That has got to change. The financial gains from the major advancements in artificial intelligence, automation, and new technology must benefit the working class, not just corporate CEOs and wealthy stockholders on Wall Street. It is time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It is time for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay.”This legislation comes ahead of aHELP Committee hearingChairman Sanders is leading this Thursday on the same issue. Witnesses who are set to testify at the hearing include Shawn Fain, International President of the UAW; Dr. Juliet Schor, Professor of Sociology at Boston College and Lead Researcher Four Day Week Global Trials; and Jon Leland, Chief Strategy Officer of Kickstarter and Cofounder of the WorkFour-The National Campaign for the 4-day Workweek.“While CEOs’ wages continue to increase, our workers are finding themselves doing more, yet earning less than they have in decades,”said Sen. Butler.“The Thirty-Two-Hour Workweek Act would allow hardworking Americans to spend more time with their families while protecting their wages and making sure profits aren’t only going to a select few.”Rep. Takano said:“As the lead sponsor of the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act in the House of Representatives and a Senior Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I am thrilled Senator Sanders is leading the Senate companion to this transformative legislation that will be a win for both workers and workplaces.”In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) into law establishing the 44-hour workweek through overtime protections – the first broadly applicable federal standard for working hours in the U.S. Just two years later, the FLSA phased-in today’s 40-hour workweek to the American people, which has remained the federal standard ever since. Before these federal labor standards were established, workers – including children – in the early 19th century were on the job more than 70 hours a week, often in horrendous and dangerous working conditions. In the late 1800s, workers conducted major strikes for an 8-hour workday, coining the historic slogan, “Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what you will.”Today, American workers are more than400 percentmore productive than they were in the 1940s. However, millions of Americans are now working longer hours for lower wages. As of 2019, nearly40 percentof U.S. workers are on the job at least 50 hours a week, and a staggering18 percent– or 28.5 million workers – are clocking at least 60 hours a week. The average full-time worker in the U.S. now works42 hoursa week – although this estimate does not necessarily account for those working multiple jobs. On top of this, more than8 millionAmericans work multiple jobs, with4.7 millionworking a second part-time job on top of a full-time job.Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, andJamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, predicted last year that advancements in technology would lead to a three or three-and-a-half-day workweek in the coming years. Despite these predictions, Americans now workmore hoursthan the people of most other wealthy nations, but areearning less per weekthan they did 50 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.The Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act is endorsed by: AFL-CIO, UAW, SEIU, AFA-CWA, UFCW, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), 4 Day Week Global, WorkFour, and the National Employment Law Project (NELP).“This bill underscores the escalating trend towards diminishing work hours,”said Dr. Dale Whelehan, CEO of 4 Day Week Global.“Increasing evidence firmly supports that reducing working hours yields beneficial outcomes for businesses, individuals, and the broader community. At 4 Day Week Global, we are thrilled to support this endeavour spearheaded by Senator Bernie Sanders, marking further progress towards a future of work that prioritizes sustainable human performance and well-being.”“We applaud Senator Sanders’ bold initiative that will create a better life for all Americans,”said Vishal Reddy, Executive Director of WorkFour – the national campaign for the 4-day workweek.“100 years ago, critics of the 5-day workweek predicted doom, as they worried that a weekend would set the United States’ economy back. Instead, it helped launch us to the front of the global pack by creating a thriving middle class. Once the 4-day workweek becomes a reality, every American will have nearly six years returned to them over their lifetime. That’s six additional years to spend with their children and families, volunteer in their communities, learn new skills, and take care of their health. The data shows that the 4-day workweek is a triple-dividend policy that benefits everyone – workers, companies, and society. Now is the time to act.”Read the bill summary,here.Read the bill text,here.

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., March 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held a roundtable discussion at the Vermont State House on Saturday afternoon with the student finalists of his fourteenth annual State of the Union Essay contest. The contest gives Vermont high school students the opportunity to describe a major issue facing our country and propose what they would do to solve it.Find photos of the eventhere. To read the essays of the finalists and winners, clickhere.“The reason we do this contest each year is to have young people around the state imagine being the President of the United States,”said Sanders.“It is a chance for them to think critically about the problems that face our country but also about solutions. Some of you have written about topics you have studied in your classes, some of you have written about issues you’ve seen in your own lives – in your families and communities – but my guess is that most of the time no one has ever said to you, ‘how would you fix this problem?’, and that’s the conversation we’re going to have here today.”This year, 454 students from 27 Vermont high schools submitted essays. A panel of seven Vermont educators served as volunteer judges, ranking the essays and selecting 12 finalists and three winners. Students wrote on a variety of critically important issues, including climate change, racial justice, access to mental health care, political polarization, gun safety, disability rights, racial justice, and more.Sanders provided introductory remarks and then began the discussion portion of the event. As each student presented their essay and proposed solutions, Sanders posed questions to the larger group and opened up debate on each topic. Sanders encouraged the students to make connections between the various topics and to feel comfortable disagreeing with each other. While individual issues ranged from substance misuse to education funding to indigenous water rights to campaign finance, the overall theme of the discussion highlighted the many similarities between how the U.S. government decides to address these issues and who has the power to make change.While discussing homelessness, students made connections to the high cost of housing as well as how people who are experiencing homelessness are often discriminated against. Third place winner, Leah Fitzgerald, talked about her own experience as part of the Northwest Career & Technical Center, where she has volunteered with homeless individuals as part of the human services program. She shared that while some people assume that those experiencing homelessness are on drugs or dealing with mental health issues, the research shows that this is not the case for most people. While there are those who struggle with these challenges, most did not deal with them until after losing their housing.In discussing banned books, participants explored how some people may want to ban books to protect children from reading about difficult topics versus using an educational setting as an appropriate place to discuss complex issues. A topic of particular interest to these Vermont high school students was the issue of secondary education funding. During the discussion, students brought up the differences in funding at schools across Vermont, questioning whether it’s possible to expect the students in lower funded schools to be able to achieve the same success as students in higher funded schools.Finalist Andres Miguez of Mount Mansfield Union High School wrote about a topic on the minds of many Vermonters: the July flooding that destroyed so many homes and businesses across our state. Andres raised the important question of how we rebuild from flooding, looking at a future that will likely see more natural disasters due to climate change.Four of the finalists discussed issues related to health care: Maggie Short of Bellows Free Academy-Fairfax and Pat Frazier of Champlain Valley Union High School both wrote about substance use disorder and overdose prevention, Oliver Nichols of Burlington High School wrote about mobile health clinics, and Talia Gibbs of Vermont Commons School wrote about Long COVID. In considering each topic, students discussed how individuals’ access to health care is often impacted by how much money they have and where they live.During the conversation, Sanders and the finalists considered how all of the topics raised were impacted by the topic considered by Jack French of Essex High School: Money in politics.Jack shared,“Corporate greed leads to people with the money financing elections and politicians paying more attention to them and what they want than their own constituents. If we had a way of electing people without this outside influence, we’d be able to solve a lot of the other problems we’re talking about today.”“I love serving as a judge in Bernie’s State of the Union essay contest and reading the work of Vermont’s high school students,”said Sarah Soule, a Guidance/College Counselor from Middlebury Union High School and one of the judges of the contest.“Their interest and engagement in such an array of issues that matter is inspiring. Their voices have value and it is wonderful to see them at the table with Bernie, discussing such important topics.”Sanders concluded the event saying,“Your generation is living through tough times and these are tough topics. But by reaching out and talking about them, you will see that you are not the only ones worried about these issues.”Sanders entered the finalists’ essays into the Congressional Record, the official archive of the U.S. Congress. Since Sanders started the contest, over 6,100 students throughout Vermont have written essays.To read the essays of the finalists and winners, clickhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders on President Biden’s Decision to Build Emergency Port in Gaza
Date: March 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on President Biden’s decision to build an emergency port to immediately deliver critical supplies to Gaza:

I welcome President Biden’s decision to direct the U.S. military to establish an emergency port on the Gaza coast to allow large quantities of food, water, medicine, and other essential supplies to be delivered directly to the people of Gaza. This is a necessary step to respond to the horrific humanitarian crisis unfolding there and address the widespread starvation, disease, and desperation caused by this war and Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid entering the area.

But let’s be clear about why this extraordinary step is necessary: Despite months of increasingly urgent requests from the very highest officials in the U.S. government, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his extreme, right-wing government have refused to let in sufficient humanitarian aid. That has led to this incredible situation, in which a U.S. ally is using U.S. weapons and equipment to block the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid. And now, American taxpayers have to pay even more to build a port to get aid into starving people, because Israel won’t let it be driven safely and efficiently across the border.

Hundreds of thousands of people are starving to death – President Biden is right to act decisively to prevent a further catastrophe. But the United States provides Israel with $3.8 billion in military aid every year, and Congress is considering another $14 billion this year. It’s time we stopaskingIsrael to do the right thing and starttellingIsrael whatmusthappen if they want the support of the United States.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Colleagues Call on Schumer to Investigate War Profiteering in the American Military Industrial Complex
Date: March 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 7 – With the United States on track to spend more than $1 trillion on the military this year, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and five colleagues this week sent aletterto Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urging him to reconstitute the World War II-era Truman Committee to investigate war profiteering and price gouging in the American military industrial complex. Sanders was joined on the letter by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).“The United States needs a strong military, and Ukraine needs our help,”wrote the senators.“But the current model must be reformed. The defense budget must be run efficiently and cost-effectively and cannot continue as corporate welfare by a different name.”While negotiations continue around the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations deal, Congress has already authorized an $886 billion base defense budget. When defense spending outside of the Department of Defense (DOD) budget is included, the total rises to more than $900 billion. In addition, the Senate recently passed – and the House is now considering – a $95 billion supplemental spending package, which would further increase military spending if signed into law.Nearly half of the money going to the Department of Defense (DOD) is allocated to a handful of hugely profitable defense contractors. The DOD accounts for about two-thirds of all federal contracting and issues more in contracts than all U.S. civilian agencies put together. Yet this money goes out the door without adequate safeguards against waste, fraud, and abuse. For decades, the DOD has failed to pass an independent audit despite being required to do so by federal law and now is the only federal agency that has never passed an independent audit. Last year, the DOD could not fully account for 63% of its $3.8 trillion in assets.In the 1990s, there were 51 major defense contractors in this country. Today, they have consolidated into five giants: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. These big five use the monopoly positions granted them by the U.S. government to reap enormous profits, sharing more than $118 billion in Pentagon contracts in Fiscal Year 2022. This has led to rampant price gouging and the transfer of taxpayer dollars to wealthy shareholders.“It’s therefore no surprise that defense contractors routinely overcharge the Pentagon by nearly 40 to 50 percent, lining their pockets at taxpayer expense,”wrote the senators.“For example, RTX Corporation has increased prices for Stinger missiles sevenfold since 1991, leaving the U.S. paying more than $400,000 to replace each missile sent to Ukraine. Yet somehow, RTX has the money to announce plans to buy back $37 billion in stock through 2025. Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, received $46 billion in unclassified contracts in 2022, and returned about one quarter of that amount to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.”Thesenators continued:“There’s a name for all this: war profiteering. These companies’ greed is not just fleecing the American taxpayer; it’s killing Ukrainians. A contractor padding its profit margins means that, for the same amount of federal spending, fewer weapons reach Ukrainians on the front lines. Given the urgency of providing Ukraine what it needs to defend itself from Putin’s aggression and of safeguarding taxpayer dollars, Congress must investigate this situation.”The letter urged Leader Schumer to push to reconstitute the Truman Committee to investigate war profiteering, the effects of consolidation in the defense industry, the lack of sufficient oversight over U.S. military spending, and options for further use of the Defense Production Act or other federal authorities to provide for the national defense in a more cost-effective and transparent manner.Read the full letterhere.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Bernie Sanders Leads HELP Committee Hearing on the Older Americans Act
Date: March 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led the committee in a hearing titled, “The Older Americans Act: Supporting Efforts to Meet the Needs of Seniors.”Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchhere:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.Before we get to the Older Americans Act, I just wanted to make a couple of observations.First, as you all know, this committee launched an investigation into the outrageously high cost of inhalers that millions of patients with asthma and COPD need to breathe. Our investigation pointed out that, in some cases, Americans were paying more than ten times the price for their inhalers compared to the people of other major countries. In the last month, I have had the opportunity to speak to the CEOs of the four major corporations that produce these inhalers. I am happy to mention that today, one of those manufacturers, Boehringer Ingelheim, announced that it is substantially lowering the cost of their inhalers in America by making sure that every uninsured or under-insured patient in America will pay no more than $35 for these devices. I very much appreciate this step forward by Boehringer Ingelheim and look forward too seeing the other major corporations follow suit.Secondly, I wanted to tell you what I think most of you know. The minibus that was passed by the House yesterday and will soon, I expect be passed by the Senate, contains new funding for community health centers, the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Centers. The community health center program will go up from $4 billion in mandatory funding to $4.4 billion, the National Health Service Corps will go up from $310 million in funding to $364 million and the Teaching Health Center program will go up from $126.5 million in funding to $201 million. This committee has held a number of hearings on primary health care and I think there is wide recognition that our system is in crisis, not enough doctors, nurses, mental health counselors, dentists, pharmacists, etc. Also, tens of millions of Americans, even those with decent insurance, are unable to access health care in a timely manner. While, given the dysfunctionality of Congress, the amount of increases we obtained for these three important programs is significant, it goes nowhere near far enough and I hope that, in the coming months, this committee will once again return to the need to transform the primary healthcare system in America.Now, let’s get to the subject matter today, the Older Americans Act.According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 23 percent of seniors in America are living in poverty compared to just 12 percent in Canada, 9 percent in Germany and 4.4 percent in France.Further, one out of every four seniors in America is trying to survive on an income of less than $15,000 a year.Today we will be paying attention to the urgent unmet needs of millions of seniors in America and what we should do as a society to reduce the senior poverty rate, to reduce hunger, and to improve the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in our country.In America today, 12 million seniors are dealing with food insecurity and worried about not having enough food to eat.Nearly a quarter of our nation’s seniors are considered to be socially isolated and more than one out of every four seniors suffer from tragic falls – the leading cause of death from injury among our elderly population.Nearly 95 percent of adults over the age of 60 have a chronic health condition and 80 percent have two or more chronic conditions like high blood pressure, arthritis and diabetes.Seniors throughout our country, particularly in rural areas, lack the transportation they need to get to a doctor’s office, the grocery store or the dentist.That should not be happening in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world.In my view, both from a moral perspective and from an economic perspective, we cannot turn our backs on the millions and millions of seniors who are hurting and who desperately need our help today.Now, here is the good news.We have a very effective piece of legislation on the books to address the urgent needs of vulnerable seniors and that is the Older Americans Act.The Older Americans Act provides federal funding for many essential services for our nation’s seniors including helping older adults live at home, supporting our nation’s caregivers, activities to combat loneliness and isolation, preventing disease, job training, protections from abuse, and rides to the doctor’s office and grocery store.Importantly, about 45 percent of funding from the Older Americans Act is used to provide meals to millions of frail and isolated seniors through Meals on Wheels and through congregate meal programs at senior centers.So, when we talk about the Older Americans Act, let us understand that some 45 percent of the funding is going to nutrition programs for seniors who need that help.And let’s be clear: These nutrition programs not only provide good nutrition but anybody who understands the Meals on Wheels program knows that its importance is not just the actual meals delivered, but also the fact that somebody is knocking on their door to see how they are and to chat with them for a few minutes.This social interaction can mean an enormous amount to somebody who is living alone and who doesn’t communicate much with the world.Not only does the Older Americans Act save lives and ease human suffering, it saves money.If seniors do not get the nutrition they need and seniors become malnourished, what happens to those seniors?Well, if you’re malnourished, by definition, you’re going to get sick more often than you should. If you’re old and you’re sick, where do you end up?You may end up in the emergency room at great expense to Medicare and Medicaid. If you’re malnourished and you’re weak and you fall and you break your hip, which happens all the time, you end up in the hospital at an expense of tens and tens of thousands of dollars.As a matter of fact, malnutrition among seniors today costs our society over $50 billion each and every year.The truth is that it makes a lot more sense to provide adequate nutrition to frail seniors than to spend money on preventable hospital costs.In fact, it costs less to feed a senior for an entire year through the Older Americans Act than it does for a senior to spend one night in a hospital.Providing adequate nutrition services for seniors also reduces the need for nursing home care. In America today, the median cost of a private room in a nursing home is over $100,000 a year.Most seniors would prefer to stay in their own homes. We can do that. It saves the system money and keeps seniors in contact with their friends and their family. But to do that, we have to make sure that their basic needs are taken care of.Despite the success of the Older Americans Act in keeping seniors healthy, independent, and out of hospitals and nursing homes, its programs have been inadequately funded for years.Since 2016, despite increased demand and a massive increase in the number of seniors in America, funding for the Older Americans Act has gone down by nearly 20 percent after adjusting for inflation.As a result, seniors who are desperate for nutritious food are being put on waiting lists that can last for months.One out of every three Meals on Wheels programs in America today have waiting lists and some programs are being forced to close their doors.While over 2 million seniors receive nutrition services under the Older Americans Act, over 12 million seniors are food insecure and are unable to access these services.Clearly, now is the time for Congress to act.We can choose to continue to waste billions of dollars on emergency room visits and unnecessary hospital stays, or we can provide older Americans with the resources and the services they need to live healthier, more secure, and more dignified lives.The Older Americans Act is an important part of the solution.In my view, it is our responsibility not simply to re-authorize this legislation and maintain the status quo. It is our responsibility to expand the Older Americans Act so that every vulnerable senior in America can receive the services that they need.And that is why I am very proud to have authored a letter signed by 41 of my colleagues in the Senate calling for a doubling of funding for the Older Americans Act – from over $2 billion a year to a level of more than $4.6 billion a year.I request unanimous consent to insert that letter into the record.Now, I understand that $4.6 billion sounds like a lot of money and it is a lot of money. But it is even more expensive for Medicare and Medicaid to pay tens of billions of dollars in healthcare bills every year because of senior malnutrition and senior falls.As Senator Cassidy has reminded us over and over again: An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.And with that let me recognize Senator Cassidy for his opening statement.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Bipartisan Group of Colleagues Seek Information from Stakeholders on Older Americans Act Reauthorization
Date: March 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 7 – Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Ranking Member Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), with Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ranking Member of the Special Committee on Aging, Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) today requested input from stakeholders on policies the Committee should consider during the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA). Specifically, the senators asked for feedback on the effectiveness of pandemic-era flexibilities, as well as policies enacted by the 2020 reauthorization, in responding to the needs of older adults across the United States.

The OAA was last reauthorized in 2020 and will expire on September 30, 2024.

Read the full requesthereand below.

To Interested Parties:

The Older Americans Act (OAA; P.L. 89-73, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), was first enacted in 1965 to provide a broad range of services and programs for older adults. Congress has reauthorized and amended OAA over a dozen times to include services for individuals with disabilities, family caregivers, and those living in nursing homes. OAA’s programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Community Living (ACL), as well as the Department of Labor (DOL). OAA was last reauthorized in 2020 and will expire on September 30, 2024.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on older Americans and demonstrated the value of OAA programs for older adults. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act Congress granted flexibilities to assist organizations in adjusting their operations throughout the pandemic. The Committee is seeking feedback on how pandemic-era flexibilities as well as policies enacted by the 2020 reauthorization worked or did not work in responding to the needs of older adults.

Reauthorizing OAA is a priority of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We look forward to working with interested stakeholders as we move legislation through the committee of jurisdiction. We ask for written responses on the following inquiries submitted toOAA@help.senate.gov, by March 21, 2024. Please provide data and primary source information, as is feasible, in answering the questions specific to HELP Committee’s jurisdiction below. You may also choose to provide line edits to current law or other proposed legislative text to supplement your narrative response.

General Questions:

Targeted Questions:

4. ACL recently finalized regulations regarding OAA. Should Congress consider any changes in response to the new rule?

Title: NEWS: Sanders Applauds Boehringer Ingelheim for Reducing Inhaler Costs to $35
Date: March 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday issued the following statement after Boehringer Ingelheim announced that it would cap patient copays for all of its inhalers at $35 starting on June 1, 2024. The company also announced that it will lower the list price of some of its inhalers.

The announcement comes on the heels of the January 8 HELP Committeeinvestigation, led by Chairman Sanders, along with HELP Committee members Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), into the four major manufacturers of inhalers, including Boehringer Ingelheim, and their efforts to manipulate prices.

Sanders said:

In January, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions that I chair launched an investigation into the outrageously high cost of inhalers that 25 million Americans with asthma and 16 million Americans with COPD rely on to breathe. In my view, Americans who have asthma and COPD should not be forced to pay up to 70 times more for the same exact inhalers as patients in Europe and other major parts of the world are being charged.

Today, I am very pleased that some important progress is being made to make inhalers more affordable to patients who desperately need them in our country.

Boehringer Ingelheim has announced today that patients in America who are uninsured or under-insured will pay no more than $35 for the inhalers that they manufacture beginning on June 1st of this year. The company has also agreed to reduce the list price of some of its inhalers. These are very positive steps in the right direction.

A Vermont resident recently told my office that she has to pay $320 per month for Boehringer Ingelheim’s Spiriva HandiHaler. As a result of today’s decision, she could save more than $3,000 a year on the inhaler that she needs to breathe.

Today, I am calling on the three other major manufacturers of inhalers to take similar action. And they are AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Teva. If Boehringer Ingelheim can take action to cap the cost of inhalers at $35 in the United States and lower the list price of some of the inhalers it manufactures, these other companies can do the same.

The Senate HELP Committee will continue to do everything we can do to make sure that Americans no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Bernie Sanders Calls Out the Absurdity and Hypocrisy of Continued U.S. Support for Netanyahu’s Horrific War
Date: March 6, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 6 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tonight spoke on the floor of the U.S Senate about the absurdity and hypocrisy of the United States continuing to support Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people and failure to do more to avert the unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Gaza:Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:Madam President, I think that, as human beings, we have a tendency to try to avoid thinking about horrifying situations. Who wants to think about or focus on things that are painful and terrible?But, whether we like it or not, there is today a horrifying catastrophe unfolding in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of children are facing starvation because of Israel’s indiscriminate bombardment and unacceptable restrictions on humanitarian aid getting across the border.And let me remind every American and every Member of Congress, this is not some far-away natural disaster that we as Americans have nothing to do with. This is not an earthquake in Japan. It’s not a drought in Sudan. It’s not flooding in China. The reality is that we as American taxpayers are complicit in this humanitarian disaster. And, as Americans, we must end it.First, let me briefly recap where we are today.Madam President, Hamas started this terrible war with a brutal terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent Israelis and took 253 hostages, more than 100 of whom remain in Hamas’ hands, including Americans. And just the other day the U.N. reported that there is strong evidence that Hamas also committed horrific sexual assaults against Israeli women of the worst kind imaginable. Nobody will or should forgive or forget those atrocities.As I have said many times, Israel had the right to respond to that attack and go after Hamas, but it did not and it does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people. And that is what Israel has done.For five months now, Israel has unleashed total war on Gaza, relying on widespread bombardment, including the use of 2,000-pound bombs.The results have been catastrophic. In the last five months, Israel has killed nearly 31,000 Palestinians and injured more than 72,000, two-thirds of whom are women and children. Two-thirds of whom are women and children.The United Nations has had 165 staff killed by Israeli forces, more than in any other previous war. Some 364 health workers, people who are there trying to take care of the sick and the wounded, and 132 journalists, who are reporting on the situation, have been killed as well.Madam President, as this terrible photograph shows, the Israeli bombardment has left Gaza in ruins. Seventy percent – let me repeat – 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.Unbelievably, 1.7 million people in Gaza have been driven from their homes, taken out of their homes, and sent away without really knowing where they’re going to go, or whether or not they’ll ever return, or in fact be able to return to after this disaster. And that 1.7 million people is 80 percent of the population of Gaza.Madam President, the civilian infrastructure in Gaza has been devastated, making life unbearable for the people who reside there. There is virtually no electricity and little running water. There is not a single fully functional hospital for the 2.2 million Gazans despite the enormous medical need that the bombardment has caused. People are getting injured, no place to go.And, Madam President, as horrible and as unspeakable as all of this destruction is, we are seeing something today that is even worse.For months, the U.N. has warned that, because of the Israeli blockade of food and water, starvation and disease were growing threats. They warned in December that a quarter of the population of Gaza, over half a million people, were one step away from famine. Since then, Madam President, the situation on the ground has only worsened.People have been reduced to eating leaves and animal feed. They are starving to death. They are starving to death. And in the last week, reports of children dying from malnutrition and dehydration have begun to emerge. At least 15 children have starved to death. Unfortunately, these reports are likely to be the first of many.Despite this nearly unprecedented crisis, despite hundreds of thousands of children facing starvation, humanitarian access has actually deteriorated – deteriorated – during the last month. The needs are significantly greater, but the aid that is coming in is less.In February, an average of 97 trucks got in to Gaza each day, down from about 150 in January, and well short of the 500 trucks per day before the war. The situation is now so desperate and so inhumane that many of the trucks entering Gaza are unable to reach their destination because they are set upon by starving people who are ripping food boxes from the trucks. In other words, people are seeing the trucks coming. They’re unable to get to the destinations that they are supposed to because starving people are fighting for food.Madam President, let us be crystal clear about why this is happening. It is happening because Israel is not letting in enough humanitarian aid. And it’s actually that simple. They’re not letting in the food, the water, the medical supplies, the fuel, that desperate people need.Israeli restrictions on aid mean that only a tiny fraction of what is needed is getting in to Gaza today. And even when that aid gets in, we are seeing Israeli military activities that result in very little of that aid reaching the most desperate areas.In the north, almost no aid has gotten through, leading to the terrible incident of last week where desperate Palestinians pulling sacks of flour off of a few trucks that got through were met with gunfire from Israeli troops. Earlier in February, Israeli forces fired on a U.N. food convoy trying to reach the north despite it having been cleared by the Israelis. And just yesterday, the Israeli military turned back a World Food Program convoy carrying 200 tons of food to starving people in north Gaza.Madam President, none of what is going on in Gaza today is a secret. Anyone who wants to know does know.And let me share with you what some of our leading U.S. officials have said about the war and the current situation. President Biden has repeatedly called the Israeli bombing “indiscriminate” and called Israel’s response in Gaza “over the top.”He said, “there are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people in trouble and dying, and it has to stop.”President Biden this week said, “there’s got to be cease-fire.” “We must get more aid in to Gaza.”He also said, “we’re going to insist, insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more people the help they need. No excuses, because the truth is aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now. It’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line, and children’s lives are on the line.” -President Joe Biden. That’s not Bernie Sanders. That’s President Joe Biden.Vice President Kamala Harris said, “we have seen reports of families eating leaves and animal feed, and women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care, and children dying from malnutrition and dehydration.”The Vice President also said, “the Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses. They must open up new border crossings, they must not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the delivery of aid. They must ensure humanitarian personnel sites and convoys are not targeted.” -Vice President Kamala Harris.Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have repeatedly emphasized these points to the Israelis, pushing and urging them to be more targeted, to protect civilian life, and to let water and food into Gaza so children do not starve. You’ve got the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, you’ve got the National Security Advisor saying over and over again: Israel must change its policies.And in the midst of all of that, how has Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu responded to those requests and those comments? Here is the American government saying one thing – how has Netanyahu responded?Well, his response has not been complicated. He has ignored them. He has ignored what the President of the United States said, what the Vice President of the United States said, what many of us in Congress are saying, what the Secretary of State is saying, National Security Advisor is saying. He has ignored it all.Madam President, despite all of this, despite Netanyahu’s refusal to adhere to any of the requests and concerns that our government has conveyed to him, the United States continues to pull out all the stops to support his devastating war against the Palestinian people.Year after year, we have provided $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel. U.S. taxpayer money. More recently, the administration requested, and the Senate has approved – against my vote, I should add – another $14 billion in military aid to this right-wing, extremist Israeli government. $10 billion of that money is completely unrestricted military aid that will buy more of the bombs Netanyahu is using to destroy Gaza.And just today – today – The Washington Post reported that the United States has delivered more than 100 military sales to Israel since the war began. That’s right. Despite the scale of the devastation, the U.S. taxpayers continue to fund this war.And today we learned that the administration has been breaking up these armed sales to Israel into smaller tranches to avoid triggering Congressional notification requirements. That is unacceptable, and that is a brazen violation of the spirit and intent of the law.Madam President, that is not the only way that the administration is refusing to adhere to the U.S. law.Israel’s interference in U.S. humanitarian operations is in clear violation of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act. And that law and its language could not be clearer, so I want everybody to hear what the law says:“No assistance shall be furnished … to any country when it is made known to the President that the government of such country prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.”That’s the law. The law is that, if a country prevents humanitarian assistance coming to these starving children, it is violating the law. It could not be clearer than it is. And I think very few people doubt that Israel is in violation of that law. Yet, the administration and the Congress do nothing.The State Department doesn’t even pretend to apply the Leahy law to Israel, refusing to properly track U.S. arms or even identify which Israeli units receive U.S. security assistance, a basic requirement of the law and a standard applied to every other country.Madam President, as I go around Vermont and around the country, it is my strong feeling that the American people are increasingly disgusted by the destruction of Gaza and the unbelievable misery that is befalling the Palestinian people who are there.And the American people want it to end. They don’t want to be part of seeing children go hungry. They don’t want to be part of seeing an entire community literally destroyed.Just the other day, and I hope my colleagues in Congress hear this – just the other day a YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans agree that the U.S. should halt weapons shipments to Israel until Israel stops its attacks on Gaza. 52 percent, and a lot of people were undecided, and those who supported it was much, much less – a small minority. 62 percent of respondents who voted for President Biden agreed that the U.S. should stop shipments to Israel until Israel discontinues its attacks on Gaza, while just 14 percent disagree.In other words, the American people in general, and those who voted for President Biden in particular, want this war ended. They want the destruction stopped.The American people understand a simple truth that we here in the nation’s capital continue to ignore. And that is that it is absurd and hypocritical to publicly profess horror at Netanyahu’s inhumane war while, at the same time as we say how terrible it is, how awful Netanyahu is, at the same time, we ship tens of thousands of bombs to his army.It is absurd to criticize Netanyahu’s war in one breath and provide him another $10 billion to continue that war in the next.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this disaster is the fiction we tell ourselves here in Congress and that is there is nothing, just nothing that we can do. Isn’t this awful? My goodness, look at how all of those buildings have been destroyed, 70 percent of the housing units, it’s terrible! Children going hungry, terrible. Children coming down with disease, terrible. Terrible. Nothing we can do. Really?Everybody knows what is happening. We see it every day in the news and we see the pictures, the emaciated children and the people bombed while they sleep. And yet Congress pretends we are powerless to stop it.Well, Madam President, the fact is this is not a natural catastrophe. This is a manmade catastrophe. And if we had the political will, and if we had the courage to stand up to some very powerful special interests, yes, we could stop it. We could stop the destruction and we could make sure that these kids do not starve to death.But doing so will require that the United States government and Members of Congress have the courage to stand up to Netanyahu and to use the incredible leverage that we have over the Israeli government to secure a fundamental change in their disastrous policies.Of course we have the leverage! We are funding the war! And if that’s not leverage, I don’t know what leverage is.The current reality is, Madam President, frankly, embarrassing. I supported the President’s decision to airdrop supplies to desperate civilians in north Gaza. Airdrops will buy time and save lives. It is the right thing to do, and I’m glad that the President did it. But the truth is, there’s no substitute for sustained ground deliveries and many, many hundreds of trucks every single day getting into Gaza.And, right now, we have the incredible situation where a U.S. ally is using U.S. weapons and equipment to block the delivery of U.S. humanitarian aid. We are funding them to stop us from doing what we want to do! And if that’s not crazy, I don’t know what is.Madam President, it is far, far past time for us to stop asking Israel to do the right thing and to start telling Israel what must happen if they want the support of U.S. taxpayers.Israel must open the borders and allow the U.N. to deliver supplies in sufficient quantities. The U.S. government should make it clear that failure to open up access immediately and feed starving people will result in the Netanyahu government not getting another penny of U.S. taxpayer military aid.Madam President, the United States simply cannot allow hundreds of thousands of children to starve to death. Whether Netanyahu like it or not, the United States must do what is necessary to get supplies into Gaza.Madam President, we all know that there will be a very long and tortuous road to achieve lasting peace in the region and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.The people of Israel have the absolute right to live in peace and security without worrying about terrorist attacks. The Palestinian people have the absolute right to self-determination, to live in peace, and to have a state of their own.And, Madam President, I hope very much that there will be new leadership that will emerge on both sides – within Israel and within the Palestinian community – to make that happen and to achieve a meaningful peace process.But one thing is very clear: that is, given the unprecedented humanitarian disaster that is occurring in Gaza right now, the United States must end its complicity.With that, I yield the floor.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Chairman Sanders to Lead HELP Committee Hearing on the Older Americans Act
Date: March 5, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 5 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday, March 7 at 11:00 a.m. ET will lead the committee in a hearing titled, “The Older Americans Act: Supporting Efforts to Meet the Needs of Seniors.”“Today in America, it is no secret that too many seniors are struggling to get by,” said Chairman Sanders. “In the richest country in the history of the world, it is unacceptable that millions of seniors are living in poverty and struggling to put food on the table while one out of every four of our nation’s seniors is trying to survive on an annual income of less than $15,000 a year. With our nation’s rapidly aging population, this is an issue that will only get worse if we do not act now. We must address this crisis before it is too late. Increasing funding for the Older Americans Act is an important way to do just that.”First signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Older Americans Act (OAA) has provided vital nutrition, social, economic, and health services to millions of vulnerable seniors for nearly six decades. These highly effective services have not only saved lives they have saved taxpayers money.With a rapidly aging population, a strong and well-funded OAA is critical to addressing and combatting the many crises faced by seniors in America. From 2010 to 2020, the share of residents 65 or older grew by more than a third – the fastest rate of any decade in 130 years. By 2035, the number of Americans aged 60 and over is expected to rise to nearly 95 million.Nutrition programs established by the OAA are able to feed a senior for an entire year for the same cost as one night in the hospital. If 10 percent of older Americans with at least one chronic condition were to enroll in the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program funded by the OAA, the U.S. could save $6.6 billion in health care costs. OAA-funded prevention programs have been estimated to reduce the number of falls by seniors by up to 55 percent and reduce annual health costs by up to over $900 per participant. Falls by older Americans result in $50 billion in medical costs each year with the majority paid by Medicare and Medicaid.In April 2023, forty-two senators, including Chairman Sanders and Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), sent aletterto Senate appropriators requesting a doubling in funding for OAA programs.The OAA was last reauthorized in 2020 and will expire on September 30, 2024.DetailsWhat:Hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to consider “The Older Americans Act: Supporting Efforts to Meet the Needs of Seniors”When:11:00 a.m. ET, Thursday, March 7, 2024Where:Room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Bernie Sanders Statement on Primary Care in New Minibus Funding Deal
Date: March 3, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), released the following statement on the minibus agreement announced Sunday by Congressional leadership:Over the past year, one of my top legislative priorities as Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee has been to address the primary care crisis in America and the massive shortage of doctors, nurses, dentists, and mental health professionals in our nation.In the richest country in the history of the world, it is my view that every man, woman, and child in America should be able to receive the primary care they need in their own community. I am sad to say that we were not able to convince Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to achieve that goal. But given the dysfunctional political environment in Congress, I am proud that we were able to reach a deal to provide meaningful increases in funding for primary care in America.Under this agreement, community health centers will be receiving the largest increase in mandatory funding in a decade, equivalent to a rate of $4.4 billion through the end of the year. Community health centers are the backbone of our primary care system providing high quality care to over 31 million Americans.Under this agreement, the National Health Service Corps will be receiving a 17 percent increase in funding equivalent to a rate of $364 million through the end of the year. This important program provides loan forgiveness and scholarships to doctors, dentists, nurse practitioners, and other medical professionals who practice in rural and underserved areas.Under this agreement, the Teaching Health Center program will receive a 59 percent increase in funding equivalent to an annual rate of $201 million through the end of the year. Teaching Health Centers are extraordinarily important because they allow medical school graduates to do their residencies in community health centers, and if we want more doctors to practice in rural and underserved areas this is an important way to do it.Let’s be clear: This funding deal is not the end of the discussion. It is just the beginning. As the Chairman of the HELP Committee, I will not rest until everyone in America is entitled to health care as a fundamental human right, not a privilege.

WASHINGTON, March 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement urging President Biden to invoke Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act, demand Netanyahu restore humanitarian aid access to Gaza or lose U.S. military assistance to Israel:Starvation is taking place in Gaza. Israel is prohibiting aid convoys from delivering desperately needed food and water. This is in clear violation of Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act. The law is very clear:“No assistance shall be furnished … to any country when it is made known to the President that the government of such country prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.”Today I urge President Biden to implement this law and make it clear to Israel that, if aid access is not immediately opened up, he will impose consequences under the Foreign Assistance Act and stop military assistance to Israel.

WASHINGTON, March 1 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today issued the following statement calling on the United States to immediately begin a massive humanitarian airdrop of lifesaving supplies to the people of Gaza, who are on the verge of starvation and dehydration, and demanded that Israel open the borders to allow humanitarian aid in to Gaza:

The United States, which has helped fund the Israeli military for years, cannot sit back and allow hundreds of thousands of innocent children to starve to death. As a result of Israeli bombing and restrictions on humanitarian aid, the people of Gaza are facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster. Whether Netanyahu’s right-wing government likes it or not, the United States must immediately begin to airdrop food, water, and other lifesaving supplies into Gaza.

But while an airdrop will buy time and save lives, there is no substitute for sustained ground deliveries of what is needed to sustain life in Gaza. Israel MUST open the borders and allow the United Nations to deliver supplies in sufficient quantities. The United States should make clear that failure to do so immediately will lead to a fundamental break in the U.S. – Israeli relationship and the immediate halt of all military aid.

Title: NEWS: New GAO Report Commissioned By Senator Bernie Sanders Finds DOD Fails to Take Basic Steps to Combat Fraud Despite Spending More Taxpayer Money Than All Other Agencies Combined
Date: February 29, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 – According to anew report, commissioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and released Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has failed yet again to take basic steps to combat fraud in its massive contracting enterprise. Among other findings, the report showed the DOD often fails to even utilize the bare minimum of publicly available data to vet information provided by contract bidders. These shortcomings are costing taxpayers billions in misused funds.“America’s national priorities are badly misplaced,” said Sanders. “We apparently have unlimited amounts of money to spend on the military industrial complex despite the decades of absurd waste, fraud, and financial mismanagement by the Pentagon. But somehow, we can’t summon the resources to provide for the basic needs of the American people. That is absolutely unacceptable. If we are serious about spending taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively, the time is long overdue for Congress to hold the Defense Department to the same level of accountability as the rest of the government. That is the very least we can do.”The United States spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined, and the DOD accounts for more than half of the federal government’s discretionary spending. By far the largest contracting agency in the federal government, the DOD obligates more money than all U.S. civilian agencies put together. In Fiscal Year 2022 alone, the DOD issued contracts totaling $414.5 billion, with more than $118 billion in Pentagon contracts going to Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman.Despite this massive spending, the DOD remains the only federal agency in the country that has failed to ever pass an independent audit – a requirement under federal law for all government agencies since the early 1990s – and has remained on the GAO’s High-Risk List for waste, fraud, and abuse for 34 years. Last year, the DOD failed its sixth consecutive audit and was unable to fully account for 63 percent of its $3.8 billion in assets. In 2022, the Navy audit found $4.4 billion in previously untracked inventory, while the Air Force identified $5.2 billion worth of variances in its general ledger. Not only that, but reports have found defense contractorsroutinely overchargethe Pentagon – and the American taxpayer – by nearly 40 to 50 percent. One company, TransDigm, overcharged by 4,451 percent.For thenew report, the GAO interviewed key oversight staff and analyzed 4,703 criminal fraud investigations conducted by DOD investigators from 2015 to 2021. The GAO found that the DOD has yet to implement a system that utilizes data analytics, such as cross-checking publicly available information with information provided by private contractors, to detect fraud or identify suspicious activity, an unacceptable shortcoming for a contracting operation of this size.The report also found that the DOD has failed to fully implement past GAO recommendations, such as documenting fraud risk management roles within its staff or completing the membership of the Fraud Reduction Task Force established following GAO’s previous investigation in 2021. Additionally, the DOD continues to have difficulty identifying the ownership of some of the entities they contract with, resulting in clear fraud risks and national security concerns. In response to these findings, GAO made 11 recommendations to improve fraud risk management, assign responsibility for oversight to senior officials, improve data integrity, learn from fraud risk investigations, and harness data analytics to detect and reduce fraud.This latest GAO report follows others commissioned by Sanders that help shed light on the lack of federal oversight within the DOD. In light of these reports, Sanders and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), along with Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), introduced theAudit the Pentagon Act, which would require the DOD to finally pass a full, independent audit in fiscal year 2024. If enacted, the legislation would require any DOD component that fails to obtain a clean audit to return one percent of its budget to the Treasury for deficit reduction.Read the full report,here.

Title: NEWS: Ahead of Hearing, Chairman Sanders Releases Report Exposing Depth of Retirement Crisis Facing Working Class Americans
Date: February 28, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 – Ahead of this morning’shearingin the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on the retirement crisis in America, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the committee, released a stunning newreportexposing the depth of the crisis, while also exploring solutions that will allow all Americans to retire with dignity and security – not just the very wealthy.

Key findings from the report include:

“In the richest country in the history of the world, a secure and dignified retirement should be available to every American, not just the extreme wealthy,” said Sanders. “Right now, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. More than 50 percent of our nation’s seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $30,000 a year. That is absurd. Congress must address the retirement crisis facing working class Americans across our country.”

The report finds that defined benefit plans, which provide workers with monthly pension payments, are the most cost-efficient way to provide a secure lifelong retirement. A defined benefit plan typically is 49 percent more cost effective than a defined contribution account, which leave workers beholden to individual investment returns. Yet roughly 27.2 million workers participated in defined benefit plans in 1975, versus 11.2 million workers participating in defined contribution plan. In 2019, 85.5 million workers participated in defined contribution plans versus 12.6 million defined benefit plan participants.

The Congressional Budget Office found the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans may explain about one-fifth of the increase in wealth inequality from 1989 to 2019.

The report also examined how workers are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if they can do so via payroll deduction and 20 times more likely to save if access to a workplace retirement plan is automatic. Today, roughly 57 million Americans do not have a way to save for retirement easily and automatically out of their regular paycheck and only 13.5 percent of workers have a pension.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: HELP Committee to Hold Markup, Including on the Renomination of Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su

“I strongly support Acting Secretary Julie Su’s renomination to serve as Secretary of Labor,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the HELP Committee. “She has been an excellent Deputy Secretary of Labor, an excellent Acting Secretary of Labor, and I believe that she will make an excellent Secretary of Labor. Her strong pro-worker track record and tireless dedication to working families across this country shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is the right person for the job. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.”

Su has served as Acting Secretary of Labor since March 2023 and was confirmed by the full Senate to serve as Deputy Secretary in July of 2021. The Senate HELP Committee previously voted to advance Su’s nomination to Labor Secretary in April of 2023.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: HELP Committee to Hold Hearing on Confronting the Retirement Crisis Facing Working Class Americans
Date: February 21, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 – The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), will hold a hearing on Wednesday, February 28 at 10:00 a.m. ET titled, “Taking a Serious Look at the Retirement Crisis in America: What can we do to expand defined benefit pension plans for workers?”

“At a time when more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings and more than 50 percent of our nation’s seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $30,000 a year, we must address the retirement crisis facing working class Americans,” said Sanders. “In the richest country in the history of the world, it is a national disgrace that one in ten seniors live in poverty. We have the tools to ensure that every senior in America can retire with the dignity and security that they deserve. It’s time to act.”Today, nearly half of all Americans are at risk of a financially insecure retirement, up from one in three workers in 1983. Part of this issue stems from the decline in access to defined benefit plans, which provide workers with a specified pension payment, typically in the form of monthly checks. In contrast, defined contribution plans shift the risk on to individual employees and the amount they provide depends more on individual investment returns. A defined benefit plan is typically 49 percent more cost effective than a defined contribution account. In 1975, roughly 27.2 million workers participated in defined benefit plans, compared to 11.2 million workers participating in defined contribution plans. In 2019, 85.5 million workers participated in defined contribution plans compared to 12.6 million defined benefit plan participants.

Limited access to retirement plans in the workplace have also contributed financially to insecure retirements for many Americans. Today, only 13.5 percent of workers have a traditional pension and about 57 million Americans do not have a way to save for retirement easily out of their regular paycheck. Workers are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if they can do so via payroll deduction and 20 times more likely to save if access to a workplace retirement plan is automatic.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Sends Letter to Attorney General as BlackRock Appears to Violate Federal Law
Date: February 20, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 – BlackRock, the asset management firm, is attempting its largest acquisition in 15 years with its purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a private equity firm which manages $100 billion in infrastructure assets around the world. In response, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today sent aletterto Attorney General Merrick Garland, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan, and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in strong opposition of the deal’s approval, citing what appears to be a clear violation of the Clayton Act.

Under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, investors cannot have a stake in companies where “the effect of such an acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.”  If this deal is approved by federal regulators, BlackRock would combine GIP — the third largest infrastructure asset manager in the world — with the more than $50 billion in infrastructure assets it already owns, for a total of $150 billion in infrastructure assets.

“BlackRock has made clear that the acquisition of GIP is part of an ongoing strategy to dominate the infrastructure industry,” wrote Sanders. “Beyond its move to dominate infrastructure investment specifically, this acquisition would allow BlackRock to extend its dominant position as an asset management company more broadly, which is a major concern under Guideline 6 of the FTC and DOJ merger guidelines which states that ‘mergers can violate the law when they entrench or extend a dominant position.’”

Today, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $9 trillion assets under management. BlackRock also controls the Aladdin (Asset, Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network) system, which handled portfolio and risk management for nearly $22 trillion in assets in 2020. Fannie Mae, MetLife, and PNC all use Aladdin, giving BlackRock reach over investments outside of its own portfolios.

Sanders continued, “This deal is yet another example of how BlackRock is looking to further concentrate its economic power, which is dangerous for our economy and consumers. Infrastructure is a fundamental part of everyday life. We rely on our roads, bridges, drinking water systems, wastewater plants, railways, schools, and housing to live. Asset managers are increasingly taking control over the infrastructure industry, making it more and more concentrated. The inevitable result of this concentration is unavoidable, higher costs for consumers.”

In 2022, as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders held a hearing on Wall Street greed and growing oligarchy in America, inviting BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to testify. Mr. Fink declined.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Applauds Administration’s $1.5 Billion Award Aimed at Revitalizing Semiconductor Manufacturing in Vermont
Date: February 19, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Feb. 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today applauded the announcement by the Biden-Harris Administration that the U.S. Department of Commerce will provide $1.5 billion in planned direct funding for GlobalFoundries as part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This will include funding for the modernization of GlobalFoundries’ facility in Essex Junction, adding secure capacity for essential chip manufacturing for automotive and other key markets, and creating jobs and apprenticeship programs for hundreds of Vermonters.

“There is no doubt that there is a global shortage in microchips and semiconductors which is making it harder for manufacturers to produce the cars, cellphones, and electronic equipment that we need,” said Sanders. “This federal investment will bring valuable support to help this industry succeed in Vermont by supporting innovations in development, manufacturing, and production. It will also create good-paying jobs for hundreds of Vermonters, and bring in apprenticeship programs to teach the next generation. I applaud the Biden-Harris administration for this funding.”

The funding will allow for upgrades in existing facilities, expand capacity as well as create the first U.S. facility capable of high-volume manufacturing of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for use in electric vehicles, power grids, data centers, 5G and 6G smartphones and other critical technologies.

GlobalFoundries’ facility in Vermont is their longest continuously operated facility where semiconductors are made. Today, about 85% of phones have a GlobalFoundries chip in it.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Sends Letter to FDA Commissioner Urging Strong Warning Labels to Combat Diabetes Epidemic and Obesity in America
Date: February 15, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 – As discussions on a new proposed front-of-package label rule that would better inform consumers about the health impacts of their food are underway at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent aletterto FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, M.D. urging the FDA to require corporations in the food and beverage industry to put strong, evidence-based warning labels on their products to protect the health of the American people.

“I am encouraged that the FDA has begun the process of issuing a proposed front-of-package label rule that would better inform consumers about the health impacts of their products high in added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats,” wrote Sanders. “However, from what I have seen thus far, these efforts do not go nearly far enough.”

Sanders continued, “In my view, we need strong front-of-package labels so that all consumers, especially children, can understand which products are harmful to their health. Tobacco labels in the United States do not say ‘high in tar, high in nicotine, high in carcinogens.’ They say ‘cigarettes cause cancer.’”

Today, one out of every five children and over 40 percent of adults in our country are obese. Equally as alarming, more than 10 percent of people in the United States have type-two diabetes. According to a recent study, ultra-processed foods now make up an incredible 73 percent of our nation’s food supply and can be as addictive as alcohol and nearly as addictive as cigarettes. It is estimated that, if the United States does not change course, the number of children with type-2 diabetes will increase by 700 percent over the next 40 years.

Countries like Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, and others have successfully implemented strong front-of-package nutrient warning labels. New nutrient warning labels implemented in Chile were associated with fewer purchases of unhealthy products high in salt, sugar, and saturated fats. In Mexico, front-of-package labels include a stop sign and additional disclosures that identify products containing caffeine and other harmful ingredients that should be avoided by children.

Last December, the Senate HELP Committee held a hearing on the diabetes epidemic in America. The Committee will soon hold a hearing to discuss how the FDA can better fulfill its mission to protect and advance public health by ensuring that the food and beverages Americans consume do not harm them. Sanders has invited FDA Commissioner Califf to testify.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: HELP Committee to Hold Hearing on Outrageous Cost of Prescription Drugs, CEOs to Testify
Date: February 7, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 – The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), will hold a hearing Thursday, February 8 at 10:00 a.m. ET titled, “Why Does the United States Pay, by Far, the Highest Prices in the World for Prescription Drugs?” with the CEOs of Bristol Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck all testifying.

The CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, Chris Boerner, agreed to testify in early January. Last week, after a subpoena vote was scheduled, Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato and Merck CEO Robert Davis reconsidered their original positions and agreed to give testimony.

“The simple truth is that the American people are sick and tired of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” said Sanders. “I look forward to a very productive hearing, and hope very much that the CEOs of these major pharmaceutical companies will take a serious look at these incredible price discrepancies and work with us to substantially reduce the prices they charge the American people for these and other prescription drugs.”

Today, Merck charges diabetes patients $6,900 for Januvia when that exact same product can be purchased for $900 in Canada and $200 in France. Johnson & Johnson charges Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara, while that same product can be purchased for $16,000 in the United Kingdom. Bristol Myers Squibb charges patients in America $7,100 for Eliquis, while that same product can be purchased for $900 in Canada and just $650 in France.

Due to the high cost of prescription drugs, one out of four Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry has spent, over the past 25 years, some $8.5 billion on lobbying and over $700 million on campaign contributions.

In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly $18 billion in profits, paid its CEO over $27 million in compensation and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit, handed out over $7 billion in dividends to its wealthy stockholders, and paid its CEO over $52 million in compensation. Last year, Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits, while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation.

Under the chairmanship of Sanders, the HELP Committee has focused, among other isssues, on lowering drug prices in America. The committee has already heard testimony from four pharmaceutical CEOs representing Moderna, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi.

Sanders and the committee were pleased that the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that Moderna would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their COVID vaccine out of pocket. In a separate HELP Committee hearing last year, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed to Chairman Sanders that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products after a prior commitment to substantially lower prices for the insulin they manufacture.Hearing DetailsWhat:Hearing of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to consider “Why Does the United States Pay, by Far, the Highest Prices in the World for Prescription Drugs?”When:10:00 a.m. ET, Thursday, February 8, 2024Where:Room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement announcing his plan to introduce an amendment to the foreign aid supplemental package that would remove $10.1 billion in offensive weaponry funding for Netanyahu’s right-wing government. The amendment preserves funding for defensive systems that will protect Israeli civilians against incoming missile and rocket attacks. Sanders’ statement is as follows:

“27,000 dead – two-thirds of them women and children.

67,000 wounded.

1.8 million displaced from their homes.

70% of housing units damaged or destroyed.

And now, hundreds of thousands of children facing starvation.

This is unacceptable. The United States cannot be complicit in this humanitarian disaster.

That is why I will be offering an amendment to the supplemental bill to ensure zero funding for the continuation of Netanyahu’s illegal, immoral war against the Palestinian people.”

Originally scheduled for January 26, but rescheduled due to weather, the press conference and media availability will now take place this Friday, February 2

BURLINGTON, Vt., Jan. 31 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this Friday, February 2 will visit White River Junction and Waterbury. He will first hold a press conference at the White River Junction VA to discuss new renovations at the medical center, and publicly announce plans for a new, expanded Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in the Burlington area, long championed by Sanders. CBOCs provide primary care and mental health services to veterans, in addition to a widening array of clinical and diagnostic services, including physical therapy and dermatology. The new center will improve access to quality care for local veterans, including specialty services such as podiatry, ophthalmology, occupational therapy, and dental services.

Sanders will also discuss construction that began last week at the White River Junction VA Medical Center to modernize its inpatient hospital ward. The project will renovate 27,000 square feet of the hospital in three phases, maintaining its inpatient capacity even while it modernizes.

Later in the day, Sanders will visit Waterbury Ambulance Service, which is receiving $700,000 in federal spending secured by Sanders to upgrade its aging, outdated infrastructure to a modernized, highly-efficient station to house ambulances, daily operations, and services that will better serve the people of Waterbury.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Suspension of Funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
Date: January 30, 2024

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released a statement about the decision by the United States and other nations to freeze funding for the United Nations’ agency, UNRWA, that provides food, water, and essential services for Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip – 1.1 million of whom are already at risk of starvation:

“More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in this war, seventy percent of whom are women and children. Today, hundreds of thousands of children face starvation and disease. Obviously, it’s not acceptable for any of the 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza to be involved with Hamas, and allegations against the 12 people charged must be investigated. However, we cannot allow millions to suffer because of the actions of 12 people. The U.S. and other countries must restore funding to stave off this humanitarian catastrophe.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Ahead of Vote to Subpoena CEOs to Testify on Outrageously High Prices of Prescription Drugs in America
Date: January 25, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension (HELP) today held a press conference to discuss the committee’s decision tovote to issue subpoenasfor Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato and Merck CEO Robert Davis to provide testimony about why their companies charge substantially higher prices for medicine in the United States compared to other countries.The subpoena vote is scheduled for Wednesday, January 31. If authorized, these would be the first subpoenas issued by the HELP Committee since 1981.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedHERE:There is a lot of discussion about how “divided” our nation is and, on many issues, that is absolutely true. But on one of the most important matters facing our country the American people – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Conservatives – could not be more united.And that is the need to take on the extraordinary greed of the pharmaceutical industry and to substantially lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs.As a nation we spend almost twice as much per capita as any other country on healthcare, over $13,000 for every man, woman and child. And one of the reasons for that is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.The outrageous cost of prescription drugs in this country means not only that 1 out of 4 Americans cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe, but that our insurance premiums are much higher than they should be as well as hospital costs. Further, the high cost of prescription drugs is putting an enormous burden on taxpayers and seniors by raising the costs of Medicare and Medicaid.I recently, for example, spoke to the CEO of a hospital who told me that 20% of his budget now goes to pay for prescription drugs.Meanwhile, as prescription drugs in this country are unaffordable for many, ten of the top pharmaceutical companies in America made over $110 billion in profits in 2022 and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages.As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) one of my top priorities is to substantially reduce the price of prescription drugs in America.And one of the ways to do that is to hold the chief executives of some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in our country accountable for their actions.Over two months ago, a majority of Senators on the HELP Committee invited Robert Davis, the CEO of Merck; Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson; and Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb to a hearing to discuss what they are doing to lower drug prices in America.Why did we ask these CEOs to come before us?The answer is pretty simple.Among other questions we would like some simple answers as to:Why does the United States pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – sometimes ten times higher than in other countries?Why is it that the median price of new prescription drugs in America is now over $220,000 – including many new cancer drugs?Why has the pharmaceutical industry spent, over the past 25 years, some $8.5 billion on lobbying and over $700 million on campaign contributions?Why are they spending tens of millions of dollars today on some 1,800 well-paid lobbyists in Washington, DC – including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties?How does it happen that while millions of Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, major drug companies in America spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development?These are very simple and straightforward questions that are on the minds of millions of Americans, and these are questions that the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to answer.As a result of our invitation, Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb has agreed to voluntarily testify in the HELP Committee. And we very much appreciate that.Unfortunately, up to this point, the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson and Merck have rejected our invitation. They apparently feel that they do not have to explain to the American people why prescription drug prices in this country are so high.As a result, this puts the HELP Committee in the position of having to subpoena these CEOs in order to have them testify.That vote will take place this Wednesday, January 31st at 11AM.The CEO of Merck needs to explain to the American people why they charge diabetes patients in the United States $6,900 for Januvia when the exact same product can be purchased in Canada for $900 and just $200 in France.I want the CEO of Johnson & Johnson to explain to the American people why they charge Americans with arthritis $79,000 for Stelara when it can be purchased for just $16,000 in the United Kingdom?I want to ask the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb why they are charging patients in America $7,100 for Eliquis when the same product can be purchased for just $900 in Canada and just $650 in France.And let’s be clear: These are not struggling companies forced to charge high prices to survive. Believe me, they are not going broke.In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made nearly $18 billion in profits, paid its CEO over $27 million in compensation and spent over $17 billion on stock buybacks and dividends.That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit, handed out over $7 billion in dividends to their wealthy stockholders and paid its CEO over $52 million in compensation.And Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits last year, while recently spending over $12 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and giving its CEO over $41 million in compensation.Now, the reasons the companies have given us as to why they don’t believe their CEOs should testify range from laughable to absurd.They have told us that the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson and Merck don’t have the expertise necessary to tell us why they charge so much more for their medicine than they do overseas.Merck went so far as to tell our staff that their CEO is a tax attorney who is not an expert on prescription drug prices.Well, maybe, just maybe, the CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies should become experts on this subject.And if they did maybe they would give some thought about lowering the outrageous prices that they are charging the American people.The companies also claim that the HELP Committee is somehow retaliating against Merck and Johnson & Johnson for filing lawsuits against the Administration’s plan to negotiate for lower drug prices under Medicare.That is absurd.These companies have every right to file a lawsuit against the Administration or anyone else.It is no great secret that millions of ordinary Americans feel that their government no longer represents their interests or feels their pain, and that Congress is more interested in tending to the needs of the rich and large corporations. Well, that’s not going to happen on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Large, multi-national corporations, no matter how many lobbyists they have or how many campaign contributions they make will be held accountable for what they do.I am proud of what the committee has already accomplished, but clearly much more needs to be done.Last year, the CEO of Moderna committed during a HELP Committee hearing that his company would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket.In a separate HELP Committee hearing last May, the CEO of Eli Lilly committed that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products.It is my hope that the CEOs of Merck and Johnson & Johnson will reconsider their position and voluntarily come before our committee just like 4 other CEOs in the pharmaceutical industry did last year (Moderna, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi).

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Calls on U.S. to Act on Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza
Date: January 24, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the responsibility of the U.S. government to use its leverage to deliver urgently-needed aid to Palestinians and demand an end to Israel’s indiscriminate bombing campaign. The speech comes on the heels of Sanders’first-of-its-kind Senate floor voteon a resolution under Section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act – an overlooked tool of Congressional oversight. Sanders’ resolution would have required a report examining any human rights violations that may have occurred in the course of the military campaign being carried out by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:

M. President,

I’d like to say a few words about the urgent humanitarian catastrophe now unfolding in Gaza.

And the reason that I want to do that is because I have the feeling that most people here in the Senate and throughout the country are unaware of just how severe the situation has become.

My staff and I have had a number of conversations in recent days with the United Nations, the World Food Programme, and other humanitarian actors struggling to deal with the horrors unfolding in Gaza.

The bottom line is this: the coming weeks could mean the difference between life and death for tens of thousands of people. If we do not see a dramatic improvement in humanitarian access very soon, countless innocent people – including thousands of children – could die of dehydration, diarrhea, preventable diseases, and starvation.

The World Health Organization predicts that the number of deaths from sickness and starvation could exceed the 25,000 people who have died in the war so far, mainly from Israeli bombing attacks. And let’s be clear: what is going on in Gaza today is a man-made crisis. This is not a natural disaster. This is not climate change. This is a man-made crisis taking place right now. This is the direct result of choices made by political leaders, none more than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel’s extreme right-wing government.

We all know that Hamas, a terrorist organization, began this war with its horrific attack on October 7th, which killed 1,200 innocent Israeli men, women, and children, and took more than 200 hostages. Israel, in my view, had the right to respond to that attack and go after Hamas. But it did not and does not, however, have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people – which is exactly that is happening right now.

M. President, let me try to provide a picture of what life is like in Gaza today.

More than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in this war so far – and remember, the population in Gaza is just over two million. 25,000 are dead and 62,000 wounded – seventy percent of whom are women and children. At least 210 Palestinians have been killed in the last 24 hours. Overall, 152 UN aid workers have been killed so far, more UN losses than in any previous war.

M. President, we must understand that 1.7 million people have been driven from their homes, almost 85 percent of the entire population of Gaza. Imagine that! And 70 percent of the housing units have been damaged or destroyed – an unprecedented level of destruction.

Most of Gaza’s critical infrastructure has been destroyed or made inoperable – including many wells, bakeries, power plants, hospitals, and sewage treatment facilities. Importantly, much of the area has been without cell phone service for weeks, making communication very difficult. How do you know what’s going on? How do you know what kind of bombing may be taking place, if you don’t have a cell phone that is working?

The fighting and Israeli restrictions have made it nearly impossible for food, water, fuel, and medical supplies to enter Gaza.

Water is scarce, and what little is available is often contaminated. Children are drinking very polluted water. Public wells are operating at just 10 percent capacity, and just one of three water pipelines into Gaza is functioning. For several months now, children in southern Gaza are surviving on just 1.5-2 liters of water per day, far below what is needed. And that is in the area where the UN can reach – the situation is worse elsewhere.

The lack of clean drinking water is leading to a spike in waterborne diseases and diarrhea – a very serious condition which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five worldwide. In Gaza, the UN reports 158,000 cases – more than half among children under the age of five – a 4,000% increase from before the war.

We heard from humanitarian groups last week that they fear many thousands of children will die from diarrhea before they starve to death. That is the horrible reality we are looking at in Gaza right now.

Hunger and starvation are widespread. Before the war, Gaza had 97 bakeries – right now, just 15 are operating, and none are functioning in the north, closed by the combination of airstrikes and a lack of fuel and flour. Hundreds of thousands of children go to bed hungry each night, and we have all seen scenes of desperate people are mobbing the few relief trucks that can reach beyond the border crossing.

Right now, the UN says that 570,000 people in Gaza, including many little children, are currently facing “catastrophic hunger” equivalent to famine. This is the most severe category of starvation, but the UN reports that “the entire population of Gaza – roughly 2.2 million people – are in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity.” Virtually every household is regularly skipping meals, and most are down to a single meal a day, often just bread.

Experts tell us that infants and young children will succumb first to hunger. Without enough food, or with no clean water to make formula, their vital organs will begin to shut down. Many will die of infection before they reach that point.

M. President, I have difficulties, on a personal level, even using the technical term for this stage – child wasting – I find it too horrific to contemplate. Yet that is what we are watching unfold in slow motion as the world looks on. Children starving, drinking polluted water, getting sick, and slowly dying.

M. President, in the midst of all of this, Gaza’s healthcare system is under tremendous strain. Faced with over 87,000 casualties – figures that would overwhelm the most sophisticated health system in the world – health workers have worked to save lives amid frequent bombardment in overcrowded hospitals without electricity or adequate fuel or medicine. 337 health workers have been killed.

The lack of basic necessities and overcrowded conditions are contributing to a dramatic increase in disease, and 10 percent of the population now has acute respiratory infections. Those with long-term conditions that require advanced treatment have little hope of receiving adequate care.

Amidst this devastation, approximately 180 women give birth in Gaza every day, facing unbelievable dangers and completely inadequate medical care. Without enough food or clean water, let alone necessary medications and antibiotics, many of these women face serious complications, and their children will bear lifelong scars from this war.

That is just a bit of the story of what is happening in Gaza right now – a story that we cannot continue to ignore.

M. President, let me now say a word about why this is happening – about the immediate causes of this humanitarian disaster.

And the answer is not complicated at every step of the way, the Israeli government has failed to provide even the most basic protections to civilians. Every humanitarian move has been extracted only after weeks of delay and outside pressure from the United States and others.

The result of all of this is that today just 20 to 30 percent of what’s needed in humanization aid is being allowed into Gaza. There is not enough food. There is not enough water. There are not enough medical supplies. There is not enough fuel.

Onerous Israeli border inspections are a major cause of this crisis. Today, there is a three to four week wait for trucks to get into Gaza, while children are starving. Many trucks are unloaded and reloaded numerous times, often to be searched for the same items. It’s understandable that Israel wants to ensure no weapons are reaching Hamas – we all understand that. But senior U.S. officials tell us they have seen no evidence of Hamas theft or diversion of UN aid. Meanwhile, Israel is rejecting things like tent-poles, feminine hygiene kits, hand sanitizers, water testing kits, and medical supplies. If a single item in a truck is rejected, then the whole truck has to go back to the start of the process, causing enormous delays. Kerem Shalom crossing, the main entry point equipped to process trucks in large numbers, is only open eight hours a day. And I want to thank our colleagues, Senator Van Hollen and Senator Merkley, for their courage in going to the Egypt-Gaza border and coming back here and reporting to us their personal observations of the crisis there.

It is hard to see this process and not conclude that what is taking place is a deliberate effort to slow humanitarian aid. And sure enough, just last week, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel is only allowing in the absolute minimum amount necessary.

When trucks do eventually get across the border, they face a whole new set of problems. Israel is bombing targets across Gaza, and its ground forces are fighting across much of the enclave and have closed many major roads. For aid trucks to move safely and avoid being bombed or shot, every movement must be cleared with the Israeli Defense Forces.

This deconfliction process has repeatedly failed. Even when notified, Israel has sometimes hit aid convoys. Medical facilities and humanitarian shelters cleared with the Israelis have been struck numerous times. Tragically, the first half of January actually saw a deterioration in humanitarian access. In that period, Israel denied 95% of UN attempts to bring fuel and medicines to water wells and health facilities in north Gaza.

M. President, Netanyahu’s right-wing government is starving the Palestinian people. On top of its indiscriminate bombardment, Israel is imposing onerous restrictions that are blocking the delivery of essential humanitarian aid.This is unacceptable. We are running out of time as we face one of the most severe humanitarian catastrophes of recent times.

M. President, this is not just a terrible crisis taking place many thousands of miles away from our shores. This is a tragedy in which we, the United States of America, are complicit. Much of what is happening right now is being done with U.S. arms and equipment. In other words, whether we like it or not, the U.S. is complicit in the nightmare that millions of Palestinians are now experiencing.

Israel must take urgent steps to open up humanitarian access. The water pipelines must be rapidly repaired and reopened; more border crossings, including in the north, must be opened; inspections must be streamlined and sped up; deconfliction of aid deliveries must be prioritized; and Israel must stop blocking essential humanitarian supplies.

These are not new issues – these are concerns that have been repeatedly communicated to the Israeli government for months by the United States, the UN, and the global community. The Israeli government has refused to take these steps.

M. President, this has to change NOW. Tens of thousands of lives hang in the balance. If we care about human rights, and if we believe in the dignity of every human life, we cannot allow this situation to continue. This is an urgent crisis, and every day matters.

Israel is not doing what is needed, despite the repeated pleas of the United States government, including the President himself.

That is why, in my view, we need to use every tool at our disposal to make Netanyahu change his approach.

M. President, as part of that effort, last week, the Senate voted on what I consider to be a very modest step: a resolution requiring the State Department to report on any human rights violations that may have occurred in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The resolution was based on long-standing U.S. law requiring that any security assistance or military equipment provided to any country be used in line with internationally-recognized human rights.

This is not a radical idea – making sure that the weapons we supply any country is used consistent with US law – yet just 11 U.S. Senators voted for the resolution.

M. President, we cannot continue turning a blind eye to the suffering in Gaza and the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding there. We cannot ignore the fact that it has been American bombs and military equipment that has helped cause this crisis. Given the scale of the disaster, how can any member of the Senate say they don’t want to know how billions in U.S. military aid is being used? How can we not want to have that very simple information?

M. President, my colleagues and I will continue to push for this information, which is absolutely necessary for Congress to conduct its oversight duties.

But in addition to getting answers, M. President, I believe the United States must use all of our leverage to end this horrific war. And the primary leverage we have over the Israeli government is the billions in military aid we provide to them every year and the $14 billion being proposed for Israel in the supplemental bill.

We must loudly and clearly say NO to Netanyahu’s indiscriminate bombing, NO to this man-made humanitarian catastrophe, and NO to the tremendous human suffering it is causing.

We must use our leverage to demand an end to the bombing, a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to flow to those who are suffering and to secure the release of the more than 130 hostages still being held in Gaza. We must also demand that the Israeli government begin the necessary work to lay the groundwork for a two-state solution.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Netanyahu’s Recent Comments Rejecting Two-State Solution
Date: January 20, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments rejecting the idea of a two-state solution:

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu recently said, “In any future arrangement…Israel needs security control of all territory west of the Jordan,” adding that, “I told this truth to our friends, the Americans…the prime minister needs to be able to say no, even to our best friends.”

Prime Minister Netanyahu is right – we do need to be able to say NO to our friends. He has made his position clear: He will never allow a Palestinian state, ever. He will continue his devastating war against innocent Palestinian men, women, and children. He will block the food, water, and medical supplies needed to prevent mass starvation and sickness.

Now, we must make our position clear.

Despite the illegal and inhumane actions of Netanyahu’s government, President Biden has thus far offered unconditional support to Israel. That must change. President Biden must now loudly and clearly say NO to the policies of Netanyahu’s right-wing extremist government. That is what a true friend of Israel must do in this moment.

And Congress must act. There must be no more U.S. military aid to Israel to continue Netanyahu’s war. Humanitarian aid must be immediately allowed to reach those in need. A safe release of all remaining hostages must be negotiated. Israel must work towards a lasting peace that allows two states for two peoples.

If Netanyahu continues down the path of military domination, he must do so alone. The United States cannot be complicit.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders Announces HELP Committee Votes on Subpoenas for Johnson & Johnson and Merck CEOs
Date: January 18, 2024

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 – At a time when the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), announced today that the committee will, on Wednesday, January 31, hold votes to issue subpoenas for Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato and Merck CEO Robert Davis to provide testimony about why their companies charge substantially higher prices for medicine in the U.S. compared to other countries. If authorized, these would be the first subpoenas issued by the HELP Committee since 1981.Sanders was pleased that Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb, has agreed to testify in the HELP Committee alongside at least one of the other pharmaceutical CEOs.This follows a majority of senators on the HELP Committee, on November 21, 2023,inviting all three of the pharmaceutical CEOsto a committee hearing to explain why it is that one out of four Americans cannot afford to take the medicine their doctors prescribe while prescription drug companies make billions in profits and pay their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages.Sanders said: “It is absolutely unacceptable that the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson and Merck have refused an invitation by a majority of members on the HELP Committee to appear before Congress about the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. These CEOs may make tens of millions of dollars in compensation. The pharmaceutical companies they run may make billions in profits. But that does not give them a right to evade congressional oversight. It is time to hold these pharmaceutical companies accountable for charging the American people the highest prices in the world for the medicine they need. As the HELP Committee considers legislation to lower prescription drug prices, it is critical that these CEOs explain how they determine the price of medicine in the United States.”Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb sell some of the most expensive and widely prescribed drugs in the U.S. relative to the price of those drugs in other countries. For example:

In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made $17.9 billion in profit and its CEO, Joaquin Duato, received $27.6 million in compensation. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit and its CEO, Robert Davis, made $52.5 million in compensation; while Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits and its former CEO, Giovanni Caforio, made $41.4 million in compensation.This Congress, five CEOs have agreed to voluntarily testify in the HELP Committee. Four out of the five were pharmaceutical CEOs including the CEOs of Moderna, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. Last year, the CEO ofModernacommitted to Chairman Sanders during a HELP Committee hearing that Moderna would set up a patient assistance program so that no one in America would have to pay for their vaccine out of pocket. In a separate HELP Committee hearing last year, the CEO ofEli Lillycommitted to Chairman Sanders that his company would not raise prices on existing insulin products.

An overlooked tool of Congressional oversight, Section 502B(c) allows Congress to direct the State Department to provide a human rights report and other information on any country receiving U.S. security assistance.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:

M. President,

We will soon be voting on a resolution requesting information on Israel’s human rights practices under Section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act.

There has been some confusion as to what this resolution does and does not do, so I would like to say a few words about why it is critical that this resolution comes to the floor, why it’s imperative that this resolution be passed, imperative that we have this debate and this recorded vote, and why Congress must have the information requested in this resolution.

Very sensibly, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, requires that any security assistance or military equipment provided by the United States to any country must be used in line with internationally-recognized human rights. This is not a radical idea and something I hope we all agree with. This Act prohibits assistance to any government that engages in a consistent pattern of human rights violations. That is U.S. law. – established some 50 years ago. Not a new idea.

The Act also provides Congress with several oversight tools to ensure that this law is followed. One such tool is Section 502B(c), which allows Congress to direct the State Department to provide information on the human rights record of any country, any country, receiving U.S. military assistance.

M. President, that is what this resolution does – in line with 50-year-old existing law. It directs the State Department to provide any credible information it may have on potential violations of internationally recognized human rights by Israel in its military campaign in Gaza. It focuses on the denial of the right to life caused by indiscriminate or disproportionate military operations, as well as by restrictions on humanitarian access. It also asks for information on steps the U.S. has taken to limit civilian risk in this war, a certification that the Leahy Laws are being fully applied, and a summary of the arms and munitions provided to Israel since October 7th.

This is a simple request for information. That is all this resolution is about. This resolution does not alter aid to Israel in any way. It simply requests a report on how U.S. aid is being used. This is a very modest, common-sense proposal and frankly hard for me to understand why anyone would oppose it.

So, M. President, we will soon be voting on a very simple question: Do we support asking the State Department for information on whether human rights violations may have occurred using U.S. assistance in Israel’s military campaign? That’s it! That’s what this resolution is about. It is not controversial and should be passed in large numbers.

This is not the case today. The State Department will provide a report: the information requested in this resolution is straightforward to provide and is critical to Congressional oversight. The State Department should have it readily available, as required under current U.S. law and policy. Further, in the highly unlikely event the 30-day deadline is not met by the State Department, the law allows Congress to pass a measure continuing aid.

After the report is received, Congress may then consider any changes it deems necessary to security assistance to the country in question. Any such resolution must pass both Houses of Congress and be signed by the President.

But, again, what we are voting on today is simply a request for information.

M. President, let me say a few words as to why this resolution is necessary. These rather horrific photos behind me say it all.

First, it is necessary because of the scale of the destruction in Gaza, the indiscriminate nature of the military campaign, the humanitarian catastrophe that is now occurring and the limits on humanitarian access – food, water, medical equipment and fuel.

Second, because of the extensive use of U.S. weapons in attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. Much of the destruction that has taken place in Gaza has been done with U.S. weapons.

(And third, because of the extreme statements and unclear intentions of the Netanyahu government.)

M. President, it’s been more than 100 days since this war began with the horrific Hamas terrorist attack which killed 1,200 innocent Israelis and took more than 200 hostages, over 100 of whom are still being cruelly held in captivity.

And while there is no question in my mind that Israel has the right to defend itself and go to war against Hamas, who started this terrible situation, Isreal does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people and innocent men, women, and children in Gaza. Tragically, that is what we’re seeing.

As we all know, the military campaign being waged by the right-wing Netanyahu government has led to massive destruction and widespread civilian harm. This has been, far and away, the most intensive bombing campaign of the 21st century. And as President Biden has said repeatedly, and the press and human rights monitors have exhaustively documented, this bombardment has been largely indiscriminate.

The results of this bombing campaign have been catastrophic.

Since October 7th, over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombs and over 60,000 have been wounded. Seventy percent of these victims have been women and children. It is believed that thousands more lie buried under rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza.

Since the beginning of this war 1.9 million Palestinian men, women and children have been driven from their homes – 85% of the total population of Gaza. They do not even know today if they are going to be returned to their homes! These are impoverished people who have no idea as to what their future is or whether they will ever be able to return to their homes.

Despite the sharing of coordinates with Israeli forces, 40 UN facilities have sustained direct hits, 61 UN installations have suffered collateral damage and 150 UN workers have been killed.

The UN reports that over 234,000 housing units have been damaged and more than 46,000 homes completely destroyed in Gaza, amounting to nearly 70 percent of the housing stock, a figure confirmed by academic analysis of satellite radar data. That means, and this is rather an incredible reality, that the destruction of Gaza after 100 days has surpassed the destruction of Dresden during World War II, where half the homes in that city were destroyed, and is beyond the damage in dozens of other German cities subjected to years of bombing during that war.

Today, not only are the vast majority of people in Gaza homeless, but they lack food, water, medical supplies and fuel. A recent UN report indicates that half of the population of about 2.2 million are at risk of starvation and 90 percent say that they regularly go without food for a whole day. The parents then go out of their way to make sure that the children eat first. The chief economist at the World Food Program said the humanitarian disaster in Gaza was among the worst he had ever seen. Aid groups say that in the coming weeks, the entire population could face famine.

M. President. Let’s be clear. The reason as to why this resolution must be passed is that, today, right now, as we speak, hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza, innocent children,are starving right before our eyes. We cannot continue to turn away. We must act.

Tragically, despite the efforts of the UN and others, despite the growing humanitarian crisis we are seeing, it has actually gotten harder to get aid to people in need. Aid groups say humanitarian access actually deteriorated in January, compared to December. Trucks are crossing the border, much too slowly, much too few, but even these trucks can’t go beyond the immediate border area because the Israelis won’t let them proceed safely.

That’s the situation as it stands today. Humanitarian workers who’ve spent decades serving in war zones say that this catastrophe goes beyond anything they have ever seen before.

And, M. President, let me repeat. This is not some tragedy taking place in Asia or Africa, God knows there are tragedies happening all of the world. This is a tragedy in which we, the United States of American, are complicit. Much of what is happening right now is being done with U.S. arms and equipment. In other words, whether we like it or not, the U.S. is complicit in the nightmare that millions of Palestinians are now experiencing.

The Wall Street Journal reported on December 1st that the U.S. had provided at least 15,000 bombs and 57,000 artillery shells to Israel, including more than 5,400 huge 2,000-pound bombs that can flatten entire neighborhoods.

The Washington Post reported that, in just six weeks after October 7th, Israel dropped more than 22,000 American-supplied bombs on Gaza. CNN reported that nearly half these bombs were unguided so-called “dumb bombs”.

So. M. President. That’s where we are today. 24,000 Palestinians in Gaza are dead – 2/3 of whom are women and children and 60,000 have been wounded; 70% of the housing stock has been damaged or destroyed; and almost 2 million people are trying to survive with inadequate supplies of food, water, medical supplies or fuel. And the humanitarian situation is getting worse by the minute. Hundreds of thousands of beautiful children now face starvation.

M. President, given the scale of the destruction and the extensive use of U.S. arms in this campaign, Congress must act.

That is why we must pass this 502B resolution. We must ensure that U.S. aid is being used in accordance with international human rights and our own laws.

M. President, a vote for this resolution is simply to request more information on a tragic situation that the American people care deeply about. That’s it. Go back home I say to my colleagues. Red states, blue states, this suffering is on the minds of the American people. A vote against this resolution essentially says: “I don’t want more information. I don’t want to know how U.S. military aid is being used. I don’t want to know what responsibility the U.S. may have in this humanitarian disaster. I want to bury my head in the sand.” Frankly, M. President, no matter what you’re view on this war may be, even if you don’t agree with me, we cannot bury our heads in the sand.

The truth is that since that terrible day on October 7th when Hamas attacked Israel, the Senate has had little meaningful debate on this war, despite the horrific toll and the deep concerns of many Americans. We have passed symbolic resolutions, but we have not considered a single measure that grapples with the unprecedented destruction, the humanitarian crisis, or the use of American weapons in a military campaign that has left so many dead, wounded and displaced.

No matter what happens on this vote I know that this will not be the end of this debate. It is just the beginning.

Finally, M. President, I would like to say a word about this resolution’s broader importance.

Right now, we are focusing on Israel, as we should, given what’s going on in Gaza. But, in general, what this provision does is extremely sensible. It demands accountability as to how U.S. military aid is used, and whether the recipients of that aid abide by international law and our own human rights standards. That is true for Israel, for Saudi Arabia and for any country that receives U.S. military aid. Frankly, I hope this vote is the first of many as we take a hard look at how our military aid is being used.

Therefore, M. President, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2304 and in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976, I move to discharge the Committee on Foreign Relations of the further consideration of S.Res. 504, a resolution requesting information on Israel’s human rights practices pursuant to section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: HELP Committee to Hold Hearing on Addressing Long COVID in America
Date: January 16, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 – The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), will hold a hearing Thursday, January 18 at 10:00 a.m. ET titled, “Addressing Long COVID: Advancing Research and Improving Patient Care.”

“The impacts of this pandemic are still being felt by millions of families,” said Sanders. “We cannot turn our backs on the American people who continue to struggle with long COVID. At all levels of government, we must do more to address the health crises countless Americans are living through because of the coronavirus. Lives are at stake. I look forward to hearing from patients, experts, and researchers about what we must do to address this crisis, including the advanced research and patient care that so many Americans desperately need.”

Today, millions of Americans live with long COVID and its many symptoms. These include fatigue, cognitive impairment (commonly referred to as  brain fog), muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, sleep difficulties, mood changes, and more. With millions of Americans suffering each and every day, more must be done to address this crisis.

Symptoms of long COVID for many have interfered with childcare, exercise, the ability to work, and social activities – disruptions that can impact one’s mental health. According to estimates from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, 16 million working-age Americans reported having long COVID – and of those, 2 to 4 million are out of work due to long COVID. For some, the change in job status can affect health insurance, which can further complicate treatment options.DetailsWhat:Hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to consider “Addressing Long COVID: Advancing Research and Improving Patient Care”When:10:00 a.m. ET, Thursday, January 18, 2024Where:Room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Title: FACT SHEET: 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act and Senator Bernie Sanders’ Resolution on Israel and Gaza
Date: January 13, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, requires that any security assistance or arms provided by the United States to any country must advance internationally-recognized human rights and avoid identification of the United States with any violations of those rights. The Act prohibits assistance to any government that engages in a consistent pattern of human rights violations.

The Act also provides Congress with several oversight tools to ensure this law is followed. One such tool is Section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act, which allows Congress to direct the State Department to provide information on any country receiving U.S. security assistance and that country’s observance of internationally-recognized human rights. Following this report by the State Department, the U.S. Congress may consider any necessary changes to U.S. security assistance to that country in light of the information received.Since the addition of 502B(c) to the Foreign Assistance Act in 1976, Congress has never voted to request a human rights report under its provisions.

The question the Senate will be voting on is simply this:Do you support asking the State Department for information on whether human rights violations may have occurred using U.S. equipment or assistance in Israel’s current military campaign?

As a privileged resolution, any member of the U.S. Senate can invoke Section 502B(c) through the following Senate procedure:

Senator Sanders’ 502B(c) resolutionOn Thursday, December 14, 2023, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced a resolution under Section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act to force a debate on the indiscriminate bombing campaign being carried out in Gaza by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The floor vote on Sanders’ resolution is scheduled for Tuesday, January 16, 2024.

In aspeech givenon the Senate floor on January 10, 2024, Sanders said:

“That is what this resolution does – in line with existing law, it directs the State Department to provide any credible information it may have on potential violations of internationally recognized human rights by Israel in its campaign in Gaza. It focuses in particular on the denial of the right to life – a human right enshrined in U.S. and international law – caused by indiscriminate or disproportionate military operations, as well as by the denial of basic humanitarian needs and access. It also asks for additional information on steps the U.S. has taken to limit civilian risk in this war, a certification that the Leahy Laws are being fully applied, and a summary of the arms and munitions provided to Israel since October 7th.

“In essence, we will be voting on a very simple question: Do you support asking the State Department whether human rights violations may have occurred using U.S. equipment or assistance in this war? This resolution is not prescriptive – it does not alter aid to Israel in any way. It simply requests that the State Department report on how our aid is being used. The State Department then has 30 days to provide a report responding to the request. I hope it is not controversial to ask how U.S. weapons are being used.”

Sanders continued in his remarks, “This is information Congress should have and, whatever your views on this war, this resolution should be something you can support. If you believe that the campaign has been indiscriminate, as I do, then we have a responsibility to ask this question. If you believe Israel has done nothing wrong, then this information should support that belief.”

Title: NEWS: Following Calls from Vermont Delegation, Vermonters Working In State for the Federal Government Receive Pay Bump in 2024
Date: January 12, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Jan. 12 – Following a push from the Vermont Congressional Delegation, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is increasing pay for federal employees in Vermont who support Vermonters through their work at places like the White River Junction VA Medical Center.

The locality pay increase applies to federal employees in Addison, Lamoille, and Washington Counties in Vermont who will now receive the same locality pay as federal employees living in the Burlington Locality Pay area – and to Orange and Windsor counties in Vermont who will now receive the same locality pay as employees living in the Boston area. The classification changes will mean that more than 1,000 federal employees will now receive more competitive pay rates that took effect on January 1, 2024.

“Assuring Vermonters receive the best federal services requires supporting programs that attract and retain dedicated public servants,” said the delegation. “To do this, federal agencies must provide resources for prevailing wage issues and long-term cost of living increases. Ensuring the Department of Veterans Affairs can pay its employees a living wage to care for our nations’ veterans – as well as our federal employees who work for other critical agencies like Social Security – is the least we can do. This pay raise is good news for all those Vermonters in our federal workforce and for their fellow Vermonters who they serve.”

The announcement comes after the Vermont Congressional Delegationurged OPMto take this action, and will help increase efforts to hire and retain federal employees for critical efforts, including implementation of thePACT Act, which Sanders, Welch, and colleagues passed into law last year to help get veterans exposed to toxic substances the VA health care and benefits that they need.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders on the Humanitarian Disaster in Gaza and His Intention to Bring 502B(c) Resolution to the Floor Next Week
Date: January 10, 2024
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the horrific humanitarian disaster in Gaza and what Congress should do about it. He also announced his intention to bring his502B(c) resolution– that would require the State Department to provide any credible information on potential human rights violations in the Israeli campaign – to the floor for a vote next week.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watched livehere:M. President,I would like to say a few words on the resolution I have introduced under Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act, which I intend to bring to the floor next week. This resolution is privileged, and we will have a floor debate and a recorded vote on the measure.Let me tell you what this resolution is and what it is not.Very sensibly, the Foreign Assistance Act requires that, when the United States provides security assistance or arms to any country in the world, that assistance be used in line with internationally recognized human rights. The Act prohibits assistance to any government that engages in a consistent pattern of violations. That is the law of the United States of America.The Act also provides Congress with several oversight tools to make sure this law is followed. One of these tools is Section 502B(c), which allows Congress to direct the State Department to provide a report on any country receiving U.S. security assistance and that government’s observance of international human rights.That is what this resolution does – in line with existing law, it directs the State Department to provide any credible information it may have on potential violations of internationally recognized human rights by Israel in its campaign in Gaza. It focuses in particular on the denial of the right to life—a human right enshrined in U.S. and international law—caused by indiscriminate or disproportionate military operations, as well as by the denial of basic humanitarian needs and access. It also asks for additional information on steps the U.S. has taken to limit civilian risk in this war, a certification that the Leahy Laws are being fully applied, and a summary of the arms and munitions provided to Israel since October 7th.In essence, we will be voting on a very simple question:Do you support asking the State Department whether human rights violations may have occurred using U.S. equipment or assistance in this war?This resolution is not prescriptive—it does not alter aid to Israel in any way. It simply requests that the State Department report on how our aid is being used. The State Department then has 30 days to provide a report responding to the request. I hope it is not controversial to ask how U.S. weapons are being used.Let me say a bit about why this resolution is necessary.It’s no secret that we have long been very supportive of Israel, providing billions of dollars a year in military aid for many years. We have also provided a massive influx of arms and munitions since the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack.The Israeli military has made extensive use of these U.S. arms in its campaign, including the widespread use of 2,000-pound bombs, 1,000-pound bombs, and 155mm artillery.On December 1st, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. has provided at least 15,000 bombs and 57,000 artillery shells to Israel since October 7th, including more than 5,400 huge 2,000-pound bombs that can flatten entire neighborhoods.The Washington Post reported that, in just six weeks after October 7th, Israel dropped more than 22,000 American-supplied bombs on Gaza. And CNN reported that 40 to 45 percent of the bombs used in Gaza have been unguided “dumb bombs.”Let me be very clear, this aggressive military campaign has led to massive destruction and widespread civilian harm. There is extensive evidence showing that it has been, far and away, the most intensive bombing campaign of the 21st century.Independent human rights monitors and the press have extensively documented the use of U.S. arms in strikes leading to large numbers of civilian deaths and injuries.M. President, the Israeli military campaign is not just something that concerns me and millions of Americans, it is also something that has been troubling to the entire international community. The UN General Assembly and UN Security Council have voted repeatedly and overwhelmingly to try to secure humanitarian access, to stop the bombardment, and to enact a humanitarian ceasefire. The United States has voted against or vetoed most of these efforts.M. President, we all know that Hamas started this war with its brutal terrorist attack on October 7th. There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself and respond against the perpetrators of that attack. But while it is clear that Israel has the right to go to war against Hamas. It does not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people and innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.Israel has relied on widespread bombardment, including with massive explosive ordinance in densely populated urban areas. This bombardment and the severe humanitarian restrictions have led to a catastrophe that veteran aid workers say goes beyond anything they have ever seen.And this is what the devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza looks like today.Up to now, some 23,000 Palestinians have been killed, seventy percent of whom are women and children. More than 58,000 people have been wounded. 146 UN workers have been killed, more than in any previous war.In Gaza, 1.9 million people have been displaced by the bombing and the fighting, more than 85 percent of the population. Many of these people are homeless, and some 1.4 million are crowded into UN facilities. More than 100 of these UN facilities have been damaged in Israeli attacks. Tens of thousands of others are sleeping out in the cold as winter sets in.M. President, what is absolutely unbelievable is that over 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have now been damaged or destroyed. Let me repeat that rather incredible fact: in three months of war, over 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have now been damaged or destroyed.Unbelievably, according to a study by Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, that means the destruction of Gaza after three months of war has surpassed the destruction of Dresden, where two years of bombing during World War II destroyed half of the homes in that city.All of us who know a little bit about history, when we hear the name Dresden, know that it is synonymous with the destruction of WWII. But that destruction happened over two years. Gaza matched this in two months.And now, M. President, let me talk about another horrific reality that is taking place today in Gaza. One of the outrages of the Israeli military campaign has not only been the bombing, not just the displacement, but the fact that Israel has made it extremely difficult for food water medical supplies and equipment to come into Gaza.Starvation is now a reality in Gaza. The UN reports that more than ninety percent of the population faces “acute food insecurity,” and virtually every household is skipping meals many days. Gaza is at risk of widespread famine in the coming weeks and months. Hundreds of thousands of children go to sleep hungry each night, and desperate Gazans are mobbing the few UN relief trucks that can reach beyond the border crossing.Gaza’s healthcare system has collapsed, with little electricity, water, medicine, or fuel. Only 11 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are able to function at all, and those that remain open can barely care for all the patients. The lack of sanitation is leading to disease, and in overcrowded UN facilities thousands of people must share a single shower, with more than 220 people for each toilet.That is just a small piece of the horrible reality in Gaza.Some may say: well, this is war. There’s always collateral damage. But this is not just another war – this is wholesale destruction. And it is clear that Netanyahu’s right-wing, extremist government is waging this war in a deeply reckless and immoral way.Many senior figures in Netanyahu’s government have said things that only deepen the profound concern we all should feel about this war. Several have talked about re-establishing Israeli settlements in Gaza. The current intelligence minister – among other senior officials – openly talks of permanently displacing Palestinians from Gaza. The Defense Minister declared a “total siege” at the start of the war. The Heritage Minister posted a picture of the devastation, saying Gaza was “more beautiful than ever, bombing and flattening everything.” Another Israeli lawmaker said “the Gaza Strip should be flattened, and there should be one sentence for everyone there – death. We have to wipe the Gaza Strip off the map. There are no innocents there.” I could go on.Given all of this, the scale of the destruction, and the extensive use of U.S. arms in this campaign, including thousands of massive 2,000-pound bombs, Congress must act to conduct real oversight.That is why we must pass this 502B resolution.We are deeply complicit in what is going on, and we have to ensure the U.S. aid is being used in line with international human rights and our own laws.M. President, I have supported Israel for many years. My colleagues here have as well. We all believe Israel has a right to live in peace and security, as do the Palestinians. But we’re not doing Israel any favors by ignoring this destruction. Friends have to be prepared to tell friends the truth, and the truth is that Israel is being ostracized by the world because of their actions in Gaza.The United States government has urged Israel to change its tactics to be more targeted and protect civilians. We have asked again and again. But the Netanyahu government has not listened, and has continued their military approach. In my view, that approach is immoral and is in violation of international law. In my view, the United States must end our complicity in those actions.But you don’t have to agree with me to support this important resolution, which simply asks for more information from which Congress can debate its views. This is information Congress should have and, whatever your views on this war, this resolution should be something you can support. If you believe that the campaign has been indiscriminate, as I do, then we have a responsibility to ask this question. If you believe Israel has done nothing wrong, then this information should support that belief.We aren’t likely to all agree on Israel-Palestine anytime soon. We will have more chances to debate these issues if and when we consider a foreign aid supplemental bill. But asking for more information on how U.S. arms and security assistance are being used – particularly amid this level of death and destruction – should not be controversial. In fact, it’s our job.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Chair and current member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), alongside their colleagues Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Angus King (I-Maine), and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), on Wednesday sent aletterto Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough urging they address some important structural issues within the VA’s travel reimbursement program that is affecting the ability of veterans – especially low-income veterans and veterans in remote rural communities – to manage their VA Beneficiary Travel Pay reimbursements.

Under current federal law, most low-income veterans and veterans with a service-connected disability are entitled to reimbursements for travel to and from their VA medical appointments. For many veterans, especially low-income veterans in rural communities who have to travel long distances to access their VA health care, these reimbursements are essential. However, the current system for VA Beneficiary Travel Pay reimbursements has left too many veterans, who are entitled to travel reimbursement, waiting months with hundreds of dollars in unpaid claims at any one time – putting their financial stability at risk.

“Veterans who rely on this and other VA programs should have an easy way to ensure that they are receiving the benefits they are owed,” wrote the senators. “Our veterans deserve much better, especially when they are simply trying to receive the benefits they have earned.”

Many veterans across the country have complex health conditions and require numerous medical appointments each month. Under the current system, veterans who receive travel reimbursements via direct deposit are unable to reconcile travel claim payments with their bank statements. When veterans receive multiple reimbursements on varying timelines, it is exceptionally difficult to determine the status of each individual claim, leaving many veterans with outstanding claims they are unable to account for.

“The VA must provide the means for veterans to reconcile their travel claim benefits with their travel payments on their bank statements,” said Jeffery Hasslet, a Vermont veteran who has experienced this issue. “The VA’s medical care is outstanding, however the VA’s travel claim system has been broken for years, at both the national and local levels, and needs to be fixed as soon as possible!”

In the letter, the senators asked Yellen and McDonough to respond to the following questions by January 15, 2024: How can veterans currently track individual beneficiary travel reimbursements after they have filed the initial claim; which agency bears responsibility for determining what information is included in the Prearranged Payment and Deposit (PPD) or PPD+; and are VA and Treasury considering implementing a numerical identification system that veterans can use to track their individual claims and associated payments?

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Floor Speech on Mass Atrocity in Gaza and What Congress Must Do To Address This Crisis
Date: December 19, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday evening spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and what Congress should be doing to address this crisis.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:M. President,Let me begin by wishing all Americans and my colleagues a very happy and peaceful holiday season.Unfortunately, for the people in Israel and Palestine, that will not be the case. In Gaza, millions of people will end the year under constant bombardment, exposed to the winter or living in tents, wondering where they will find their next meal, or clean drinking water, or the medical supplies they need.This is an unmitigated humanitarian disaster, and we must not look away from it.We all know the current war was begun by Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack against Israel, which killed some 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, and took more than 240 hostages. Hamas is a corrupt terrorist organization which, before and after their attack on October 7th has made it clear that their goal is to destroy the state of Israel. There is no question in my mind that Israel has the right to defend itself and respond against the perpetrators of the October 7th attack.But while it is clear that Israel has the absolute right to respond militarily against a brutal terrorist attack, it is also clear that the Netanyahu’s right-wing, extremist government is waging that war in a deeply reckless and immoral way. A just cause for war does not excuse atrocities in the conduct of that war.Israel has the right to go to war against Hamas. It does not have the right to go to war against innocent men, women, and children in Gaza. Israel’s reliance on widespread and indiscriminate bombardment, including with massive explosive ordinance in densely populated urban areas, is unconscionable.Israel’s military campaign will be remembered among some of the darkest chapters of our modern history. Consider the toll thus far.As of today, nearly 20,000 people have been killed—seventy percent of whom are women and children—and more than 52,000 wounded since October 7th. More are likely trapped under the rubble. 135 UN workers have been killed, as well as dozens of other aid workers.M. President, unbelievably, nearly 1.9 million people, more than 85 percent of the population, have been driven from their homes across Gaza. Despite sharing their locations with Israeli forces, more than 100 UN facilities have been hit in the bombardment. The UN reports that over 60 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.To put this in historical perspective, this means the destruction in Gaza is now equivalent to that of Dresden, where two years of bombing during World War II destroyed half of the homes in that city and killed about 25,000 people. Gaza has matched this in two months.This massive bombardment has made it impossible for the UN and other aid groups to provide basic necessities to the people of Gaza. As we speak, some 1.4 million people are sheltering in 155 overcrowded UN facilities. There is little electricity, food, water, medicine, or fuel – and hundreds of thousands of children are going hungry. The shortage of clean water and adequate sanitation facilities is leading to disease. And that is not to mention the lasting psychological damage being done. The UN’s senior humanitarian official said that he fears a “breakdown in society” amid this desperation.This is not just a humanitarian cataclysm, but a mass atrocity.And it is being done with bombs and equipment provided by the United States and heavily subsidized by American taxpayers. Tragically, we are complicit in this carnage.The Israeli military has made extensive use of massive explosive munitions in its campaign, including 2,000-pound and 1,000-pound bombs, and 155mm artillery. These bombs and shells are manufactured here in America and supplied to Israel by the United States.The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. has provided at least 15,000 bombs and 57,000 artillery shells to Israel since October 7th, including more than 5,400 of the huge 2,000-pound bombs that can flatten entire neighborhoods.The Washington Post reports that, in just six weeks after October 7th, Israel dropped more than 22,000 American-supplied bombs on Gaza. And CNN reports that U.S. intelligence believes 40 to 45 percent of the bombs Israel has used in Gaza have been unguided “dumb bombs.”These munitions were provided with the full knowledge they would likely be used in Gaza, a densely populated urban area with a large civilian presence. Parts of Gaza are more densely populated than New York City.The press, human rights monitors, and U.S. officials have confirmed that U.S.-provided bombs have been used in attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.M. President, this campaign very likely violates U.S. law and policy. That is why I have introduced a privileged resolution under Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act.The resolution requests that the State Department provide information on any credible allegations of human rights violations in Gaza caused by indiscriminate or disproportionate military operations and the blanket denial of humanitarian access. It also requests a list of the arms provided to Israel since October 7th and a description of the steps taken to limit civilian risk caused by Israeli military actions.We will be voting on this resolution in January, and the basic question we will be answering is: do we support asking the State Department whether human rights violations may have been committed in the Israeli campaign in Gaza?I hope that is a simple yes vote for most of my colleagues. This should not be a controversial question. If you believe, as I do, that this campaign has been indiscriminate, then it is our responsibility to ask this question. If you believe Israel has done nothing wrong in Gaza, then you should want this information to support that belief.When we receive this information, we will then have a privileged vehicle to debate any necessary changes in U.S. security assistance to Israel.M. President, while I look forward to this debate, let me also mention that I have a clear view on this issue.The United States government has urged Israel to change its tactics with regard to their indiscriminate bombing. We have asked and asked and asked. Unfortunately, the Netanyahu government has not listened or been terribly interested in our perspective.Instead they have continued their current military approach which is immoral and is in violation of international law.In my view, the United States must end our complicity in those actions. To do so, we must make two critical changes in policy:First, while it is appropriate to support defensive systems like Iron Dome to protect Israeli civilians against incoming rockets, it would be irresponsible to provide an additional $10.1 billion in military aid beyond these defensive systems as contained in the proposed supplemental foreign aid package. We should not provide this money to allow Netanyahu to continue the indiscriminate bombardment.Second, the U.S. should support efforts at the UN Security Council to end the bloodshed, such as a resolution expected tomorrow that would demand an “urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” as well the unconditional release of all hostages. This should be something we strongly support.M. President, as we soon head home to our families, let us not forget the millions of people in desperate need, both here in the United States, and around the world. In Gaza, there is a horrific situation we can and must do more to address – a situation that U.S. arms and policy have helped create. It’s time we act.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Resolution to Investigate Israel’s Indiscriminate Bombing Campaign in Gaza
Date: December 15, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 – With nearly 19,000 people killed and more than 50,000 wounded in Gaza since October 7 – seventy percent of whom are women and children – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday introduced a resolution under Section 502B(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act to force a debate on the indiscriminate bombing being carried out by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.

The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits security assistance to any government “which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.” Section 502B(c) of this law allows Congress to request information on a country’s human rights practices – such requests are privileged, allowing the sponsor to force a floor vote on the requesting resolution. If the resolution passes, the Department of State must submit the requested report within 30 days, or all security assistance to the country in question is cut off. After the report is received, Congress may then enact changes to condition, reduce, or terminate the security assistance in question. Both the initial vote to request the information and any subsequent votes to alter security assistance are privileged and require a simple majority for passage.

“We all know Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack began this war,” said Sanders. “But the Netanyahu government’s indiscriminate bombing is immoral, it is in violation of international law, and the Congress must demand answers about the conduct of this campaign. A just cause for war does not excuse atrocities in the conduct of that war.”

The resolution acknowledges Israel’s right to respond to the horrific Hamas terrorist attack and details how Israel’s indiscriminate response, including the use of massive explosive ordinance in densely populated urban areas, has devastated Gaza and caused tremendous loss of civilian life. Nearly 19,000 people have been killed, including 135 UN aid workers, and 1.9 million people have been displaced, more than 85 percent of the population. Some 60 percent of Gaza’s housing stock has been destroyed, comparable to Dresden after two years of bombing during World War II, and more than 100 UN facilities have been hit. Israel has relied on U.S.-provided arms in this campaign, including widespread use of explosive ordinance like 2,000-pound bombs and 155mm artillery in well-documented strikes that led to large numbers of civilian deaths.

Sanders said: “The scale of the suffering in Gaza is unimaginable – it will be remembered among some of the darkest chapters of our modern history. This is a humanitarian cataclysm, and it is being done with American bombs and money. We need to face up to that fact – and then we need to end our complicity in those actions.”

Based on this reality, the resolution requests the State Department report on any violations of internationally recognized human rights caused by indiscriminate or disproportionate military operations in Gaza, as well as the blanket denial of basic humanitarian needs. It also requests information on actions the U.S. has taken to limit civilian risk caused by Israeli military action, a certification that Israeli security forces have not committed any human rights violations, a summary of arms provided to Israel since October 7, and an assessment of Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Biden Administration’s New Reasonable Pricing Policy
Date: December 14, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday issued the following statement after the White House announced that the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) would make “fair pricing” a standard part of contract negotiations for tests, treatments, and vaccines. InMarch, the HELP Committee held a hearing on Moderna’s decision to quadruple the price of the COVID-19 vaccine, which was developed through a partnership with the federal government.

“I welcome the Biden Administration’s new policy to require reasonable pricing when taxpayers fund the development of certain tests, treatments, and vaccines for public health emergencies,” said Chairman Sanders. “This is an important step forward in lowering the cost of prescription drugs.

“American taxpayers should not be thanked for the world-leading investments they have put into the research and development of prescription drugs by being charged, by far, the highest prices in the world for the medicine they need. In my view, the Administration must include strong reasonable pricing requirements for all prescription drugs sold in America that were developed at taxpayer expense. If the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response can include reasonable pricing clauses, so can the National Institutes of Health.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Leads HELP Committee Hearing on Diabetes Epidemic and Obesity Epidemic in America
Date: December 14, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led a committee hearing on the diabetes epidemic and obesity epidemic in America, what is fueling these crises, and what must be done to address them.Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.In America today we have a diabetes epidemic that is having a huge impact on our country and must be addressed.Diabetes is not only a serious illness unto itself, but it is a contributing factor to heart disease, stroke, amputations, blindness, and kidney failure.Type-1 diabetes is a major problem that impacts over 1.4 million Americans and we are going to be discussing that issue today. My understanding is that Senator Cassidy has brought two witnesses who are extremely knowledgeable about type-1 diabetes.But I’d like to focus my remarks on type-2 diabetes which impacts about 95% of Americans with diabetes.There is a whole lot that can be said about the diabetes crisis in America.Here are just a few of the questions I would like to raise:First, and most importantly, why have we seen a huge increase in the number of people in America who have developed diabetes over the last 50 years? What has changed?Second, how is diabetes impacting our healthcare system?Third, given the huge number of people who are struggling with diabetes, how can we make the treatments for this serious illness available to everyone who needs it regardless of income? Further, how can we save money in Medicaid, Medicare and other public health programs that pay for the treatment of diabetes as well as private health insurance?First, the problem. Today, in America over 35 million Americans – over 10% of our population – have type-2 diabetes.And the cost of treating that disease is staggering.According to the American Diabetes Association, the total cost of diabetes in the U.S. was nearly $413 billion last year – up 27% over the past six years. This amounts to about ten percent of our total health care expenditures.And when we talk about the type 2-diabetes epidemic, and the huge increase in new cases, we must also talk about the epidemic of obesity in America. Some 90% of people with type-2 diabetes are overweight or obese. These two epidemics go hand in hand.A key question that we must discuss: How did it happen that, according to the CDC, the rate of childhood obesity in America has tripled since the 1970s and has gotten so bad that one out of every five kids, and over 40 percent of adults, in our country today are now obese?Why is it that, according to the CDC, the number of children in America with type-2 diabetes is estimated to skyrocket by nearly 700% over the next 40 years unless we take action to reverse course?The answers to those questions are not complicated.For decades, we have allowed large corporations in the food and beverage industry to entice children to eat foods and beverages loaded up with sugar, salt and saturated fat purposely designed to be overeaten.The situation has gotten so bad that most of what children in America eat today consist of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods that doctors have told us lead to a higher risk of type-2 diabetes.Alarmingly, according to a recent study that will be discussed this morning, ultra-processed foods, which make up an incredible 73 percent of our nation’s food supply, can be as addictive as alcohol and nearly as addictive as cigarettes.While the diabetes and obesity rates in America soar, while we spend hundreds of billions to treat diabetes, the food and beverage industry spent $14 billion last year on advertising to make many of their unhealthy products appealing to the American consumer.Even worse, $2 billion of this money is used to directly market food predominantly high in sugar, salt and saturated fat to our children in order to get them hooked on these products at an early age.According to the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, children and teens view about 4,000 food and beverage ads on television every year, an average of ten advertisements each day.Another study found that children who watch Nickelodeon and Nicktoons are exposed to over ten unhealthy food and beverage ads every hour.Let me give you one example. Last year, for example, Coca-Cola spent $327 million on advertising in the United States alone. Not one of their ads will tell you that drinking one or two cans of Coke a day will increase your chances of getting type-2 diabetes by 26 percent. Nor will their tv ads tell you that one 20-ounce bottle of Coke contains over 15 teaspoons of sugar – more than twice the recommended daily limit for kids under the age of 18.Nearly 30 years ago, Congress had the courage to take on the tobacco industry whose products killed over 400,000 Americans every year. Congress did that then.Now is the time for us to seriously combat the type-2 diabetes and obesity epidemic in America. In order to do that, we must have the courage to take on the greed of the food and beverage industry which, every day, is undermining the health and well-being of our children.And, in my view, a good place to start would be to ban junk food ads targeted to children.This is not a radical idea.The NIH has estimated that if the US banned fast-food advertising marketed to children, we could cut the childhood obesity rate in our country by up to 18 percent.In the 1980s, Quebec banned junk food advertising to children. Today, Quebec has the lowest childhood obesity rate in Canada and the highest consumption of fruits and vegetables of any province in their nation.Ireland, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Spain, Portugal and several other major countries throughout the world have either seriously restricted or banned junk food ads targeted to children.In addition to addressing the causes of type-2 diabetes, there is another important issue that we have got to deal with. We have got to make certain that the treatments available to people with diabetes are affordable for all Americans, are not bankrupting federal health insurance programs, or raising the cost of private insurance.The very good news is that a new class of treatments for diabetes and obesity like Ozempic and Mounjaro (Moon-jar-o) have the potential to be a game changer with respect to this major epidemic.According to clinical trials, these drugs, which suppress appetites, have been estimated to help people lose 15 to 20 percent of their weight.The bad news is that these drugs also have the potential to bankrupt Medicare and the American people.According to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, if just 10 percent of people with obesity on Medicare took these drugs, it could cost Medicare up to $27 billion a year driving Medicare premiums way, way up.Further, incredibly, these drugs (Ozempic and Mounjaro) are up to 15 times more expensive in the United States than they are in other major countries.For example, Ozempic, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, costs $12,000 a year in the United States, but just $750 in Germany.Mounjaro, manufactured by Eli Lilly, costs $13,000 in the United States but just $2,000 in the United Kingdom.Incredibly, it has been estimated that Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and others in the pharmaceutical industry stand to make as much as $150 billion off of these drugs – each and every year – while charging the American people, by far, the highest prices in the world for these drugs.That is unacceptable to me and to the American people who are sick and tired of being forced to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while the pharmaceutical companies make tens of billions in profits.That is why I will be soon introducing legislation to prevent the pharmaceutical industry from charging the American people more for prescription drugs than they charge in other major countries like Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Japan.If this bill were signed into law it could cut the price of prescription drugs in the United States by more than 50 percent.And for obscenely expensive drugs, the savings could be far more.If this legislation were enacted, it has been estimated that the price of Ozempic could be reduced from $12,000 a year to just $1,200.In my view, we cannot continue to let pharmaceutical companies rip off the American people by charging whatever price they want for their products.A prescription drug is not safe or effective for a patient who cannot afford it.Senator Cassidy, you are now recognized for an opening statement.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 – The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), will hold a hearing Thursday, December 14 at 10:00 a.m. ET titled, “What is Fueling the Diabetes Epidemic?”The type-2 diabetes epidemic and the obesity epidemic are directly related and both epidemics are getting worse. In the United States today, more than 35 million Americans are struggling with type-2 diabetes – 90 percent of whom are overweight or obese. This crisis is not only negatively impacting the health of the American people, it is also very expensive. Last year alone, the total estimated cost of diabetes was nearly $413 billion in the U.S., according to the American Diabetes Association.This crisis is being fueled by large, profitable corporations in the food and beverage industry which spent$14 billionlast year on advertising products that are predominantly high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat – products that put more Americans at risk of type-2 diabetes. About$2 billionof this money is used to directly market unhealthy food to children. During the last presidential election cycle, the food and beverage industry spent a record-breaking$42.5 millionon campaign contributions to elect candidates who will protect their interests.While the food and beverage industry is fueling this crisis, the pharmaceutical industry continues to make it harder for millions of low-income and working class Americans to access life-saving prescription drugs to treat diabetes and obesity. People with diabetes face an average of $19,736 in medical expenses, approximately 2.6 times higher than expected costs for people without diabetes. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic costs $12,000 per year in the U.S., but just $2,000 in Canada, and $750 in Germany. Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro costs $13,000 per year in the U.S., but just $2,000 in the United Kingdom.“We have a diabetes epidemic in America and an obesity epidemic in America that are both directly related and getting worse each and every day,” Sanders said. “At this hearing, I look forward to hearing from some of the leading experts in America about the role that large, profitable corporations in the food and beverage industry have played in this crisis by directly advertising unhealthy products to our children, among other things. I also want to hear from our experts about what we can do to lower the outrageously high price of diabetes drugs like Ozempic. As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I intend to do all that I can to address the diabetes crisis in America.”DetailsWhat:HELP Committee hearing titled, “What is Fueling the Diabetes Epidemic?”When:10:00 a.m. ET, Thursday, December 14Where:Room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on White House Proposal to Consider Price As a Factor In Breaking Patent Monopolies on Some Taxpayer-Funded Prescription Drugs

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Thursday issued the following statement after the White Houseannounceda new framework to help guide the use of march-in rights to break the patent monopoly on some taxpayer-funded prescription drugs:The Administration’s proposal to, for the first time, consider high prices as a factor in determining whether to break the monopolies of taxpayer-funded prescription drugs is a step forward in the right direction. But, in my view, much more must be done. The American people are sick and tired of seeing hundreds of billions of their tax dollars going to the research and development of new treatments and cures only to end up paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In my view, the Administration should reinstate and expand the reasonable pricing clause to require the pharmaceutical industry to charge affordable prices for new prescription drugs developed with taxpayer support. It should also move to substantially lower the price of the prostate cancer drug Xtandi by allowing companies to manufacture generic versions of this treatment. This is a drug that was invented with taxpayer dollars by scientists at UCLA and can be purchased in Canada for one-fifth the U.S. price.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 – Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ranking Member Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) announced today that they have reached an agreement to markup legislation reauthorizing the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act and the Education Sciences Reform (ESRA) Act on Tuesday, December 12 at 10:00 a.m. ET.Said Chairman Sanders: “We have an opioid and substance abuse crisis in America that we have got to address. It is absolutely unacceptable that more than 100,000 people in America died from an overdose last year with fentanyl and other synthetic opioids playing a role in nearly 70% of those tragic deaths. I am pleased that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize and expand the SUPPORT Act to begin to address this epidemic in America. Let’s be clear: This is a very modest piece of legislation. Much more needs to be done to address this crisis. Over the long-term, we have got to substantially increase the number of substance abuse counselors and mental health professionals in America, among many other things. As Chairman of the HELP Committee, I will do everything I can to make that happen. I am also delighted that we have come to an agreement on bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Education Sciences Reform Act. This legislation will ensure that high-quality and timely research gets into the hands of teachers and principals so that they can improve teaching and learning in our nation’s schools.”“Thousands of Americans are dying each month from opioid and drug overdoses. Reauthorizing the SUPPORT Act is crucial to better address the opioid epidemic. Glad to see the Committee taking up this important legislation.” said Dr. Cassidy. “ESRA provides research and data to inform our nation’s education system. Reauthorizing and improving this legislation helps ensure our students receive evidence-based instruction to meet their unique educational needs.”In response to the opioid epidemic, Congress passed the SUPPORT Act in 2018 – legislation which focused on prevention, treatment, and recovery services for opioid misuse, including fentanyl. While many provisions of the SUPPORT Act expired in September 2023, Congress has continued funding these programs.ESRA, which is set to be reauthorized through the Advancing Research in Education Act (AREA), was enacted in 2002 and expired in 2008. In April of 2023, Sanders and Cassidyrequested inputfrom educators, school leaders, local and state educational agencies, education organizations, researchers, families, communities, and other interested parties on policies the HELP Committee should consider during the reauthorization of ESRA to improve education research and evidence use in the classroom.Thefour billsthat the Committee will be voting on are:

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday evening spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about some of his concerns regarding the $106 billion emergency foreign aid supplemental bill that may soon be considered in the Senate.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:M. President,Let me say a few words to express my concerns about the $106 billion emergency foreign aid supplemental bill that we may soon be considering. There are pieces of this bill I strongly support, but in its present form I do not think it serves the interests of the American people. Let me explain why.First, while I strongly support Ukraine’s valiant efforts to defend itself against Putin’s invasion, and Israel’s need to defend itself against incoming rocket and missile attacks, I am deeply concerned that this legislation has no investments to address the needs of working families in the United States – 60 percent of whom are living paycheck to paycheck. Let’s be clear: it is not only foreign countries that face emergencies. We face enormous emergencies in this country right now in terms of child care, primary health care, housing, and much more. The American people do not want us to continue to ignore these issues.Second, at a time when Congress will likely soon pass a $900 billion defense bill, this supplemental bill includes tens of billions that should be covered as part of the base defense budget and handled through normal appropriations, not allocated as “emergency” spending. We can save tens of billions of dollars in this bill and dedicate that money to some of the enormous domestic crises we face.Third, at a time when some 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last two months, two thirds of whom are women and children, and tens of thousands more injured.At a time when 1.8 million people have been displaced from their homes and are struggling every day to get the food, water, medical supplies, and fuel they need to survive.At a time when over 250 people have been killed in the West Bank since October 7th, and more than a thousand Palestinians have been driven off their land there.No, I do not think we should be appropriating $10.1 billion for the right-wing, extremist Netanyahu government to continue its current military approach. What the Netanyahu government is doing is immoral, it is in violation of international law, and the United States should not be complicit in those actions.We are all clear that Hamas, a corrupt terrorist organization, began this war with their barbaric attack against Israel on October 7. Given that reality, Israel has a right to defend itself. It does not, however, have the right to wage all-out war against innocent men, women, and children who had nothing to do with the Hamas attack.Therefore, I believe it is appropriate to support defensive systems that will protect Israeli civilians against incoming missile and rockets attacks, but I believe that it would be absolutely irresponsible to provide an additional $10.1 billion in unconditional military aid that will allow the Netanyahu government to continue its current offensive military approach.That approach has included indiscriminate bombing that has killed nearly 16,000 people, most of whom are civilians.Let me repeat that figure and put it into context: 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th, two-thirds of whom are women and children. Thousands more are missing under the rubble. 16,000 in a little less than two months.In Ukraine, meanwhile, which has seen the most intense fighting in Europe since the Second World War, according to the UN, at least 10,000 civilians have been killed since Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. 10,000 in a little less than two years. That’s right, according to the UN, more civilians have been killed in two months in Gaza than in almost two years in Ukraine.Israel’s indiscriminate approach is deeply offensive to most Americans, is in violation of U.S. and international law, and undermines the prospects for lasting peace and security.Israel must dramatically change its approach to minimize civilian harm and lay out a wider political process that can secure lasting peace. That must include: a guarantee that displaced Palestinians will have the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds; no long-term occupation or blockade of Gaza; an end to the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and a freeze on new settlements there; and a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a new two-state solution in the wake of this war.M. President, the Biden administration has, appropriately, been trying to get the Israelis to be more targeted in their approach, but there is little evidence that it has succeeded. Just today airstrikes hit two UN schools housing displaced people. More than 900 people have been killed since Friday. Israeli evacuation orders are delivered with little notice to people with no electricity and limited communications service, most of whom have already been displaced and lack basic necessities. And even then, Israel sometimes bombs areas people have been told are safe. How, then, does giving Netanyahu another $10 billion with no strings attached help advance the critical policy goal of the United States to protect civilians and allow for a lasting peace? The U.S. must use its substantial leverage to accomplish this, and any additional military aid to Israel must have conditions attached to secure the necessary changes in policy. We cannot be complicit in the current Israeli approach.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Floor Speech on Israel, Palestine, and the Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza as Congress Considers Supplemental Spending Legislation
Date: November 29, 2023

WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 –Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday evening spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about Israel, Palestine, and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

M. President, I rise to say a few words about the terrible situation in the Middle East.

As you know, and the American people know, there have been five wars in the last 15 years between Israel and Hamas. How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth war from happening, sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with the need to address the root causes of this conflict? And here is the sad truth, and it really is a very sad truth: for 75 years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians and government leaders all over the world, including Presidents of the United States, have struggled to bring peace to this region. And during that time, among many other things, an Egyptian president and an Israeli prime minister were assassinated by extremists. You know why? Because they tried to bring peace to the region. This is an incredibly difficult and complicated issue and nobody has any simple solution to it.

M. President, as one of the first members of Congress to call for a humanitarian pause to the bombing – I have been very encouraged to see that pause finally happen over the last five days, and to see its extension earlier this week. That is a very positive development.  This temporary ceasefire has brought some relief to Gaza and to the families of the more than 100 hostages released so far.  The break in fighting has let an average of 200 trucks per day to enter Gaza carrying desperately needed food, water, medical supplies, and the fuel necessary to distribute aid, pump water, and run hospitals and bakeries.  While this is only 40 percent of what Gaza received before Oct. 7 – and people must recognize this, before the war there were 500 trucks coming in a day, now 200 – it is still a very substantial improvement from where we were a few weeks ago.

M. President, it seems to me that our job now is to keep working to extend this window further and to get more aid in and to get more hostages out. More aid in and more hostages out. Right now, critical talks are underway that will hopefully provide the UN the time it needs to establish a sustained humanitarian operation that can meet people’s basic needs and provide shelter and medical care. And let us be clear, the needs in Gaza are beyond enormous.

M. President, for those of us who want not only to bring this war to end, but to avoid a future ones, we must first be cleareyed about facts. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, unleashed a brutal attack against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, and taking more than 200 hostages.  No one in the U.S. Senate—no one in Congress—denies that Israel has the right to respond to that murderous attack.

Unfortunately, however under the leadership of its right-wing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and whose cabinet includes outright racists, Israel unleashed what amounts to almost total war against the Palestinian people.  Israel’s widespread bombing has left nearly 15,000 people dead, that’s in a 7-week period. 15,000 people dead, two-thirds of whom are women and children, and tens of thousands of others wounded. Israel’s military campaign, according to UN estimates, damaged or destroyed 45 percent of the housing in Gaza—45 percent!—and displaced 1.8 million people. The Israeli attacks at this point have killed 109 UN workers and left millions of Gazans on the brink of starvation, lacking water, medical care, electricity, or fuel.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks, among other things, igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want this horror to end as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with the complexity of this situation.

First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after their Oct. 7, that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction of the state of Israel. Several weeks ago, a spokesman for Hamas told The New York Times: “I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.” And let me repeat it, this is a Hamas spokesman: “I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.”

So that’s the first point. The second point is if we go back a little bit in history we understand, Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope for a peaceful settlement — maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians. Massive poverty existed in Gaza before Oct. 7, something like 70 percent of the young people in Gaza were unemployed. How is that for a reality in terms of despair and hopelessness? Those were the conditions that existed before the Israeli attack.

Needless to say, M. President, I do not have all of the answers to this never-ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and for those of us who believe in justice, it is imperative that we do our best to provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today. And let me just share a few of my thoughts as to the best way forward and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for an oppressed Palestinian population.

To start with, in my view, we must demand an immediate end to Israel’s indiscriminate bombing, which is causing, and has caused an enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of international law. The main point here is that Israel is at war with Hamas, not the Palestinian people. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood just to take out one Hamas lieutenant. That is simply not acceptable and not something the United States should be complicit with.

We must extend the humanitarian pause so that the United Nations has the time to safely set up the distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation, and disease, to build shelters and to evacuate those who need critical care. Once again, we are looking at an unimaginable humanitarian crisis and the UN is going to need as much time as it can get to help people in desperate need. This window will also allow for talks to free as many hostages as possible, and I think we all would like to see every hostage returned to their loved ones. This extended pause must not precede a resumption of indiscriminate bombing. Israel will continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm.

If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no long-term Israeli re-occupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going to be removed from power, as they must be, and Palestinians given the opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. Imagine Israeli soldiers all over an occupied Gaza. For the sake of regional peace and a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.

President, to achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs, and Gaza desperately needs a political transformation, new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must make political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership committed to peace to build support.  But what I think people all over the world want to see and the people in Gaza want to see is leadership that will take care of their needs, provide for them and allow them self-determination. Not leadership in perpetual warfare with Israel. Israel must also guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. And I am very concerned by some of the remarks we hear from Israel, from some Israeli leaders, questioning that basic right for some people to return to their communities. People who have lived in poverty and despair for years, as people in Gaza have, cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze settlements there as a first step to permanently ending the occupation. Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim stabilization period under an international force.

Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future, there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a new two-state solution in the wake of this war. The United States, the international community and Israel’s neighbors must move aggressively toward that two-state goal. This would include dramatically increased international support for the Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with Israel.

Let’s be clear: and, M. President, this is the main point I want to make this evening: we should be clear that all of this is not going to happen on its own. Left alone, sad to say, Israel is not going to bring this about. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Likud party was explicitly formed on the premise that “between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only be Israeli sovereignty,” and the current coalition agreement reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. This idea that Israel has the right to control everything between the Sea and the Jordan River, that is not ideology: the Israeli government has systematically pursued this goal. The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have used state violence to back up this de facto annexation. Sadly, tragically, since Oct. 7, the United Nations reports that at least 230 Palestinians, including 56 children, have been killed by Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to continue.

Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical issues. Now is the time for us to make clear where we stand on these issues. The truth is that if asking nicely worked, we wouldn’t be in the position we are today. Asking nicely is not going to bring about the kinds of changes that are needed. The only way these vital and necessary changes are going to occur is if the United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel. And we all know what that leverage is.

For many years, the United States has provided Israel with substantial sums of money — with close to no strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year, no strings attached. President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum and asked Congress to waive normal, already-limited oversight rules. This blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate international law and our own sense of decency. And that, M. President, includes an end to indiscriminate bombing; a significant pause to military operations so that massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region; the right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes; no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza; an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion; and, maybe most importantly, a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.

M. President, over the years, people of good will around the world, including Israelis and Palestinians, have tried to address this conflict in a way that brings justice for Palestinians and security for Israel. Israel is entitled to security and to be free of terrorist attacks. I, and some other members of Congress, have tried to do what we could. Obviously, painfully, we did not do enough. Now we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give up.

It is clear that Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing government are not going to do this on their own, which is why the United States must use its leverage to force these necessary changes and push hard for a wider political process that leads to a two-state solution.  These should be the conditions of our solidarity, including in the supplemental spending bill which we will soon be considering.

Israel is a longtime friend and ally of the United States, and I respect that.  But when there is this level of destruction and bloodshed, and when tens of billions of dollars have been requested, it is more than reasonable for the United States to have a say in where our taxpayer dollars go and how they are spent. This is money that comes from the taxpayers of the United States.  Israel has a right to defend itself, but it does not have a right to use American taxpayer funds in violation of international law, with little regard for civilian casualties.

I know when we use the word ‘conditioning’ people become very alarmed. Oh my god! Terrible idea! Virtually every dollar that we appropriate has conditions attached to it. If you are on food stamps tonight, you’ve got conditions. If you are on unemployment, you’ve got conditions. You’re on section 8 housing, you have conditions. We put conditions on everything! We don’t give away money, we say you’ve got to be eligible for it. This is what you got to do, these are the requirements — that’s conditioning.

Conditioning aid, in fact, has been for a long time seen as a key to US policy tool regarding foreign governments, including Israel. It’s not a new idea. The United States has routinely conditioned aid to countries including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, to name a few.  Presidents Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Clinton all conditioned aid to Israel to secure changes in their policies.  President Reagan actually suspended certain arms deliveries and threatened to stop all military aid due to Israel’s approach to the war in Lebanon. That’s a condition, a pretty strong condition.  Sending $14.3 billion to Netanyahu’s government, on top of the $3.8 billion we provide every year and the billions in arms the US has already provided, with no strings attached, would be a huge mistake out of step with longstanding US policy and is not something I believe the American people want to see.

I have laid out what I believe some of these conditions should be, and that is: an end to indiscriminate bombing; a guarantee that displaced Palestinians will have the right to return to their homes; no long-term occupation or blockade of Gaza; a freeze on West Bank settlements there; and a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution. Those are some of the conditions that I think we have more than a right to demand when we provide money to Israel.

Finally, M. President, let me end this on a personal note. There is no question that people all over this country have strong disagreements on the war and some of the issues that I have been discussing tonight – that is part of the democratic process. And, in a democracy like ours, it is natural that these issues be debated and that people have different points of view.  But what we cannot do under any circumstances is turn to violence because of our differences. Not to violence and not to bigotry. I have to say that, tragically, in my home state of Vermont, in the city that I live — a city of 40,000 people, Burlington, Vermont — we have experienced this form of violent hate. As I’m sure you know, a few days ago three young men, lovely young men, going to college and celebrating Thanksgiving in Burlington, Vermont were shot. And one of them is in very serious condition.

So as we all hope and pray for the recovery of Hisham, Kinnan, and Tahseen, the three young men who were shot, and await the findings of the investigation into this terrible act, let me say this again loudly and clearly. Hate has no place in my state of Vermont, or anyplace else in America. With Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, anti-Semitism, and racism on the rise in this country, we must come together and remain resolute in our commitment to fighting all of forms of bigotry and intolerance.

President, I thank you and I yield.

MONTPELIER, Vt., Nov. 21 – Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Representative Becca Balint (VT-AL) today issued the following statement:

“The U.S. Postal Service’s failure to secure safe and stable postal service facilities in Vermont’s capital city following the catastrophic flooding that displaced their offices on State Street, along with an unwillingness to communicate with the local Montpelier community or their own employees, is a complete and total abdication of their responsibilities and emblematic of the nationwide crisis and total failure of leadership of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.

“The U.S. Postal Service provides essential services that individuals, families, small businesses, and older Vermonters alike rely on every day – not only for packages and letters, but for Social Security checks, deliveries of lifesaving prescription drugs, and the ability to pay their bills on time. The residents of Montpelier need and deserve restored service in their community, and we expect regional and national USPS management to work with our federal and state leaders – and with the community – to chart a speedy, robust return to the state capital.

“Anything less is unacceptable.”

On October 31, 2023, the Vermont Delegation sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the unacceptable response by USPS to worker safety concerns and service disruptions at the Montpelier post office. Read the letterhere. To date, the USPS has failed to respond to the delegation in writing or provide satisfactory information in a timely fashion to local USPS employees.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders and All Democratic Members of the HELP Committee Invite Big Pharma CEOs to Testify at Hearing on Outrageously High Drug Prices
Date: November 21, 2023

WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 – In letters signed by every Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) today invited CEOs from major pharmaceutical companies Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb to testify before the committee on the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs.

The hearing is titled “Why Does the United States Pay, By Far, The Highest Prices In The World For Prescription Drugs?” and is scheduled to take place Thursday, January 25, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

“Here are some of the questions that the American people would like answers to,” the senators wrote in their letter inviting the pharmaceutical CEOs to testify in the HELP Committee. “Why does the United States pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? How does it happen that one out of four Americans cannot afford to take the medicine their doctors prescribe while prescription drug companies make billions in profits and pay their executives exorbitant compensation packages? How does it happen that the median price of new prescription drugs in the United States was over $220,000 last year, while the pharmaceutical industry spent billions on stock buybacks and dividends?”

Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Bristol Myers Squibb sell some of the most expensive and widely prescribed drugs in the U.S. relative to the price of those drugs in other countries.

For example, Merck sells Januvia, a drug for diabetes, for $6,000 in the U.S. compared to just $900 in Canada and $200 in France

Johnson & Johnson sells Imbruvica, a drug for blood cancer, for $204,000 in the U.S. compared to just $46,000 in the U.K. and $43,000 in Germany.

Bristol Myers Squibb sells Eliquis, a blood thinner, for $6,700 in the U.S. compared to just $900 in Canada and $650 in France.

In 2022, Johnson & Johnson made $17.9 billion in profit and its CEO, Joaquin Duato, received $27.6 million in compensation. That same year, Merck made $14.5 billion in profit and its CEO, Robert Davis, made $52.5 million in compensation; while Bristol Myers Squibb made $6.3 billion in profits and its former CEO, Giovanni Caforio, made $41.4 million in compensation.

“The American people have a right to know why it is that they pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. makes hundreds of billions in profits and pays their CEOs tens of millions of dollars in compensation,” said Chairman Sanders. “I look forward to hearing from the CEOs of large pharmaceutical companies directly on this critical issue. I also look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. A life-saving drug is not effective if the patient who needs that drug cannot afford it.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Calls for Conditioning Aid to Israel Amidst the Growing Crisis in Gaza and the West Bank
Date: November 18, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 18 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement calling for the conditioning of U.S. aid to Israel amidst the growing crisis in Gaza and the West Bank:Hamas is a corrupt terrorist organization which began this war by slaughtering 1,200 innocent Israeli men, women, and children and taking over 200 hostages. Hamas has made clear, before and after October 7, that its goal is to destroy Israel. Under those circumstances, Israel absolutely has the right to defend itself.While Israel has the right to go after Hamas, Netanyahu’s right-wing extremist government does not have the right to wage almost total warfare against the Palestinian people. That is morally unacceptable and in violation of international law. Displacing 1.6 million people from their homes, cutting off food, water, medical supplies, and fuel, and killing some 12,000 Palestinians – nearly half of whom are children – is in violation of every code of human decency. It must stop.The U.S. provides $3.8 billion a year in aid to Israel and the Biden administration wants $14.3 billion more. The Netanyahu government, or hopefully a new Israeli government, must understand that not one penny will be coming to Israel from the U.S. unless there is a fundamental change in their military and political positions. Among other conditions that must be imposed upon any aid to Israel are:

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Israel, Palestine, and Growing Humanitarian Disaster
Date: November 16, 2023

BURLINGTON, Vt. Nov. 16 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement on Israel, Palestine, and the growing humanitarian disaster in Gaza:Since October 7th, there has not been a day that goes by that I am not deeply saddened and distressed by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. To see innocent young people slaughtered at a music festival, children and elderly people kidnapped, and then, thousands of civilians killed, including entire families being wiped out and thousands of children dead, torments me and millions of others who are watching this conflict unfold.But we cannot look away.I wish there was a simple solution to this conflict. There isn’t. Non-binding resolutions that Congress won’t pass can’t do that. The issue now is to act decisively to end the indiscriminate bombing by Israel, which has caused the deaths of an estimated 12,000 people, and secure a significant humanitarian pause so that the massive humanitarian aid that is needed – food, water, medicine, and fuel – can get into Gaza and save lives. That is the immediate crisis that must be addressed. The way to bring about real change in this horrific situation is to attach conditions to any supplemental spending bill for Israel that comes before Congress.The issues that must be addressed in that bill are: an end to indiscriminate bombing and a significant pause so that massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region; the right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes; no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza; an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion; and a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.Lastly, Hamas has been very clear, both before its barbaric attack on October 7th and after that attack, that their goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction of Israel. Just last week a spokesman for Hamas, Mr. Taher El-Nounou, told the New York Times, “I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.” I am not quite sure how you negotiate a ceasefire with a terrorist organization that is dedicated to perpetual war.If we are going to have a chance at saving innocent lives, Congress must take action, the Biden Administration must take action, the world must take action. We must find a way to break this cycle of violence.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Delivers Senate Floor Speech in Defense of Student Debt Relief
Date: November 15, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 – Ahead of a vote on Senate Joint Resolution 43, that would deny student debt relief to millions of Americans, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, gave remarks today on the floor of the U.S. Senate urging his colleagues to vote “no” and instead work to cancel student debt for millions more Americans.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:M. President: I rise in strong opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 43 that we will be voting on today.M. President: Let’s be clear about what’s happening in America today.Today, while the very richest people in America become much richer, over 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and many work for starvation wages and under terrible working conditions.In America today, while CEOs are making nearly 350 times as much as their average workers, tens of millions of our people are struggling to pay the rent, pay for childcare, pay for health care, pay for prescription drugs and to put food on the table.That is especially true for our young people who, if we don’t change course economically, may well have a lower standard of living than their parents.M. President: If we lived in a nation with rational priorities, we would not be giving more tax breaks to billionaires as my Republican colleagues want.We would not be tolerating the massive income and wealth inequality that currently exists in America where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our society.What we would be doing, just like a number of other countries have been doing, is understanding that the future of America rests with its young people. And we would be doing everything we possibly could to make sure that every single person in this country, regardless of income, had the highest quality education that our nation could provide.M. President: Our goal must be to make sure that we have the best educated workforce in the world.That’s not just important for the sake of individuals, it is vital to the future of our country.Just as a poorly funded, poorly armed and poorly trained military doesn’t win battles, a poorly educated population does not flourish in a competitive global economy.M. President: In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of young people between the ages of 25-34 with college degrees. Today we are in 15th place behind countries like South Korea, Canada, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium.Over 40 years ago, a federal Pell Grant paid for over 80 percent of tuition, fees, room and board at a four-year public college.But today, because of massive cutbacks in education, Pell Grants cover less than a third of those expenses.And that is a major reason why more than 45 million Americans are drowning in over $1.7 trillion in student debt.In America today, hundreds of thousands of bright young Americans are not going to college – not because they are unqualified, but because they cannot afford it.And let’s be clear: We don’t just need more 4-year college graduates. We need more plumbers, pipefitters, carpenters and electricians. That is why we need major investments in trade schools and that is why we need to substantially expand the number of apprenticeships in America – something that the HELP Committee is actively working on.In my view, what we need to do is to make all public colleges and universities tuition free and cancel all student debt.Unfortunately, that’s not what the President’s plan does.But this is what the President’s plan does do: It cuts student loan payments in half for Americans who have taken out undergraduate loans.In fact, under the President’s SAVE plan, student loan borrowers will be seeing their monthly payments reduced from 10 percent of their income down to just 5 percent.Further, it eliminates monthly student loan payments entirely for people who make $15 an hour or less.And it gives student loan borrowers the ability to wipe out – or to substantially reduce their student loan debt over a 10-year period.M. President: If Senator Cassidy’s resolution is enacted, it would repeal President Biden’s plan and it would eliminate student debt relief for more than 5 million Americans who desperately need it.That would be absolutely unacceptable.Why do the Republicans want to repeal the President’s student loan plan?They will tell you that it costs too much money. We just can’t afford it.Really? That’s funny.My Republican colleagues had no problem voting to give away over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations when Donald Trump was President – without paying for it.They had no problem voting for a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street when George W. Bush was president – without paying for it.They had no problem voting for an $886 billion budget for the Pentagon this year despite the fact that the Department of Defense is the only federal agency in America that cannot pass an independent audit and cannot account for trillions of dollars in spending.But now, my Republican colleagues want you to believe that we cannot afford to lower monthly student loan payments for working class Americans who are struggling to put a roof over her head, pay for child care, and put food on the table? Give me a break.M. President: Let me be as clear as I can be: If we can afford to provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks and corporate welfare to the wealthy and the powerful, we can and we must provide student debt relief to millions of Americans.A vote for this resolution would deny student debt relief to millions of Americans – across every state and across every Congressional district.A vote for this resolution would place millions of Americans at risk of eventual delinquency and default on their student loans.We cannot allow that to happen.I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution and I yield the floor.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Leads HELP Committee Hearing on Labor Movement Resurgence and the Fight Against Corporate Greed
Date: November 14, 2023

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led a committee hearing titled, “Standing Up Against Corporate Greed: How Unions are Improving the Lives of Working Families,” which heard testimony from UAW International President Shawn Fain, Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien, AFA-CWA International President Sara Nelson, and other experts.

Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.

The title of this hearing is “Standing Up Against Corporate Greed: How Unions are Improving the Lives of Working Families.”

I am delighted that Shawn Fain, the President of the United Auto Workers; Sean O’Brien, the President of the Teamsters; and Sara Nelson, the President of the Flight Attendants union are here with us today and I look forward to their testimony.

Ranking Member Cassidy has invited Diana Furchtgott-Roth (fur-cot roth) with the Heritage Foundation and Sean Higgins with the Competitive Enterprise Institute and we welcome them here this morning as well.

When we talk about the state of our economy and the working class of America there is a lot to be concerned about.

Today, despite massive increases in worker productivity and an explosion in technology, the average American worker is making about $50 a week less than he or she did 50 years ago after adjusting for inflation while the vast majority of our families need two bread winners to survive. When I was a kid, growing up in a working class family most families needed just one breadwinner to pay the bills. That’s very rare today.

In America today, we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the Gilded Age.

Today, three people in our country own more wealth than the bottom half of our society – over 165 million Americans.

Today, while the very richest people in America become much richer, over 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and many work for starvation wages and under terrible working conditions.

Today, while millions of ordinary people are struggling to pay the rent, pay for daycare and put food on the table, CEOs are making nearly 350 times as much as their average workers.

Over the last 50 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in America. Unfortunately, it has gone in exactly the wrong direction. According to a study by the RAND Corporation, since 1975, over $50 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent – primarily because corporations are spending a growing percentage of their profits on stock buybacks and dividends.

And it’s not just income and wealth inequality that we should be concerned about. It is also the maldistribution of economic and political power.

Today we have more concentration of ownership than at any time in the modern history of this country. In sector after sector – a handful of giant corporations control what is produced and how much we pay for it.

Unbelievably, just three Wall Street firms (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) control assets of some $20 trillion and are the major shareholders in about 95% of S&P 500 companies.

While there is much to be concerned about in today’s economy, there is also some very good news and that is what brings us to the topic of today’s hearing.

All over this country, we are seeing workers standing up and fighting back against the unprecedented corporate greed taking place in America in a way that we have not seen in decades.

This year alone, over 450,000 workers in America have gone on strike for better wages, benefits and working conditions – up more than 900% compared to just two years ago.

Last year, union membership in America increased by 273,000 – to a total of 14.3 million workers.

Last year, employees in nearly 2,600 worksites in America filed petitions with the National Labor Relations Board to form a union – up more than 50 percent from two years ago.

According to the latest Gallup poll 67 percent of the American people support labor unions.

In other words, in America today, more workers want to join unions; more workers are joining unions; and more workers are going out on strike to improve their working conditions than we have seen in a very long time – and many of those unions are winning strong contracts for their workers.

And what we are seeing is that these historic union victories are not only improving the lives of their members, they are beginning to improve the lives of non-union workers all over the country.

After the UAW negotiated a strong contract for its union workers, Honda announced that it would be increasing the wages of their non-union workers in the US by 11 percent, Toyota announced that their US workers will receive a 9-10 percent raise; and Hyundai announced that it will be increasing wages for their US workers by 25% by the year 2028.

After the Teamsters won a strong contract to increase wages and benefits for union workers at UPS, Amazon increased wages for its non-union warehouse and delivery drivers – even as it continued to spend millions of dollars to prevent its workers from forming a union.

And let’s be clear.

We’re not just seeing unionizing efforts in blue collar jobs, we’re seeing it in white collar jobs and on college campuses.

Just this year alone, the United Electrical workers have organized more than 20,000 graduate students to join unions. Well-educated students are waking up to the fact that despite their education and stature at prestigious Universities, they are NOT exempt from exploitation.

We’re seeing writers and actors in the entertainment industry, with enormous courage, go on strike and win better wages, benefits and working conditions.

This year we have seen more and more white collar workers take on corporate greed and demand a seat at the table at companies such as Apple, Sega (Say-Ga), Activision Blizzard, and Google.

Nurses are going on strike in record numbers not so much to increase their wages and benefits, but primarily to improve the lives and the well-being of their patients through safer staffing levels at large hospitals.

Even young doctors who, in some cases, are working 80 hours a week at major medical facilities have voted to form a union so that they can provide better medical care to the people they treat.

That is the good news. The bad news is that far too many corporations are doing everything that they can to intimidate, coerce, threaten and prevent workers from exercising their constitutional right to form a union and negotiate a fair contract.

Why is that?

Well, it’s not that complicated. What corporate America understands is that union workers earn nearly 20% more, on average, than non-union workers.

Corporate America understands that 64% of union workers have a defined benefit pension plan that guarantees an income in retirement compared to just 11% of non-union workers.

Corporate America understands that union workers are half as likely to be victims of health and safety violations compared to non-union workers.

And that is why major corporations all over this country are firing workers for the “crime” of supporting a union organizing campaign.

That is why major corporations like Starbucks, Amazon and other have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal union busting campaigns and anti-union law firms.

That is why over half of all employers in America threaten to close or relocate their businesses if workers elect to form a union.

That is why when workers become interested in forming a union, they almost always will be forced to attend closed-door meetings to hear anti-union propaganda; and their supervisors will almost always be forced to attend training sessions on how to attack unions.

And even when workers overcome all of these incredible obstacles and win union elections, over half of workers who vote to form a union don’t have a union contract a year later.

We have a responsibility to turn that around.

This summer, the HELP Committee passed the PRO Act to make it easier for workers to form unions and win first contracts. We passed the Healthy Families Act to guarantee every worker in America up to 7 paid sick days. And we passed the Paycheck Fairness Act to guarantee equal pay for equal work.

This is the first year since 1997 that the HELP Committee has passed labor legislation.

In my view, these bills need to be signed into law as soon as possible.

If we are going to rebuild the disappearing middle class in America we have got to make it easier for workers to form unions and negotiate strong contracts.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 – Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility (VBSR), a statewide, nonprofit business association with a mission to leverage local business for positive social and environmental impact, held the 16th Annual “Taste of Vermont” event on Thursday evening in Washington, D.C with special guest Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Over 30 local Vermont businesses from all across the state – including Montpelier, Burlington, Townshend, Barre, Westfield, Waitsfield, White River Junction, Middlebury, and Vergennes – made the trip to Taste of Vermont to showcase their Vermont-made products, like cheese, momos, beer and cider, spirits, samosa, coffee, ice cream, maple treats, chocolates, and more. Vermont-based band, Mal Maïz, performed for the hundreds of attendees.First established at the suggestion of Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Taste of Vermont has become well-known for providing an annual opportunity for local Vermont businesses and entrepreneurs to bring their foods, beverages, and agricultural products to Washington to meet with Members of Congress and discuss the issues that matter most to them. Earlier in the day, Sanders also held a roundtable discussion with many of the participating Vermont businesses to hear about their experiences, particularly after a very difficult season for farmers and local businesses due to the disastrous summer flooding. In addition to flood impact and recovery, topics discussed included struggles to recruit employees, the high cost of health care, the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of climate change, and more. Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) joined Sanders at the roundtable and the evening event.“These are tough times, and I must say it is nice to see so many friendly faces in Washington, D.C.,”said Sen. Sanders.“I know how much our small businesses have struggled since the devastating floods. You have shown resilience and resistance, and I am enormously proud of all the work you do in agriculture and in business. This event not only celebrates our state’s rich agricultural heritage, but it showcases the work ethic that exists all throughout Vermont. I want to give a huge thanks to VBSR for not only hosting the event, but for ensuring their business model is not only about making money, but about the environment, about how you treat workers, and about how we treat each other. I also want to thank every single Vermont business in attendance – this wouldn’t have been possible without you.”“This year’s event showcased not only Vermont’s rich agricultural heritage and strong food and beverage economies, but the socially responsible business practices that have helped Vermont producers grow into global markets,”said VBSR Executive Director, Roxanne Vought.“In our 33rd year, we are the oldest socially responsible business organization in the nation and home to the highest concentration of Certified B Corps per capita in the U.S. Bringing that leadership to Taste of Vermont alongside Senator Bernie Sanders represents an unparalleled opportunity to further our vision: a just, thriving, and transformative economy that works for all people and the planet.”“Whether it’s Vermont’s world-class cheese and dairy, our craft spirits and beers, our world-renowned maple, or other high-quality artisan goods and products, the Green Mountain State has so much to showcase. I was so proud to come together with the Delegation and businesses from across Vermont to highlight what makes our brave little state so special – the hardworking people who have pride in their work, their communities, and their state,”said Sen. Welch.“This year’s Taste of Vermont proves that Bernie Sanders can add ‘Best Party Host’ to his long list of accomplishments.”“Taste of Vermont showcases some of the best small businesses and farms the Green Mountain State has to offer,”said Rep. Balint.“High quality product and community centered values are the hallmark of our local businesses. I’m thrilled our colleagues in Washington could experience the outstanding local produce and brands from Vermont right here in the Capitol.”Participating vendors at Taste of Vermont this year included: Barr Hill, Ben and Jerry’s, Big Picture Farm, Butterfly Bakery, Butterworks Farm, Cabot Creamery, Champlain Orchards, Champlain Valley Apiaries, Daily Chocolate, Global Village Foods, Jenna’s Promise, Kalche Wine, King Arthur Baking Co., Lawson’s Finest, lu·lu Ice Cream, Maple Wind Farm, Monti Verdi Salumi, Monument Farms Dairy, Screamin’ Ridge Farm, Sherpa Foods, Stowe Cider, Strafford Creamery, Sugar Bob’s Finest Kind, Switchback, The Alchemist, The Tipsy Pickle, Vermont Creamery, Vermont Moonlight, Vermont Sugar Makers’ Assn., Westminster Bakery, and Wilcox Ice Cream.This year’s Taste of Vermont was held in the U.S. Senate’s Kennedy Caucus Room, where Supreme Court justices are confirmed and the Titanic and Watergate hearings were held, and the local business roundtable was held in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing room.Find photos from Taste of Vermonthere.Find photos from the roundtable discussionhere.Find the event flyerhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Veterans Day

Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Chair and longtime member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, today issued the following statement regarding Veterans Day:Today and every Veterans Day, we honor the service and sacrifices made by our nation’s veterans – our friends, family, and neighbors – who have put on the uniform to serve our country. Thank you to all the veterans and their families across Vermont and the nation for their bravery and sacrifice.Today and every day, we must recommit ourselves to keeping America’s promise to our nation’s veterans, just as they kept their promise to us. I believe that if someone takes an oath to serve their country, to go off to war, to risk their life, or risk coming home wounded – in body or in spirit – then that government has a duty to make good on its commitment. That means making certain that veterans and their families get all the benefits they earned through their service on time and without delay. That means ensuring access to the best quality health care this country can provide by protecting and strengthening the Department of Veterans Affairs, and that means ensuring no veteran goes hungry or is forced to sleep on the streets.As the former Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am proud to have worked closely with the VA here in Vermont to secure approvals for updating infrastructure at two Vermont VA locations, including a major renovation at the White River Junction Medical Center, providing veterans with greater access to care in modern medical facilities. In addition, last year, Congress passed the most comprehensive expansion of VA health benefits in years with the signing of the PACT Act, which provides millions of Vietnam, Gulf War, and Post 9/11 veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service with the health care and benefits they deserve. Since being signed into law, the VA has approved over 500,000 disability claims and has expanded health care to nearly 200,000 new veterans without disabilities under PACT Act authority.Once again. Thanks to all our veterans and their families for what they do for our country.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 – With growing reports of horrific anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and racism occurring on college campuses and in schools across the U.S. since October 7, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today released the following statement:Given the horrific war taking place in the Middle East, we are seeing a significant increase in bigotry and in hate crimes here in the United States. This is unacceptable, not what this country is about, and all of us have a responsibility to end this growing crisis.This afternoon I had a briefing with the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education who expressed her deep concerns about the growing number of instances of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia that we are seeing on college campuses and in schools all over America. That is why I strongly urge college and university presidents and school leaders to be firm about protecting the safety and well-being of all students, faculty, and staff, and to make it clear that bigotry on campuses and in schools will not be tolerated.That is why I have requested a classified briefing with the FBI, the U.S. Department of Education, and other government officials to learn more about the serious rise in hate crimes not only on college campuses and in schools but throughout the general public. I also look forward to their ideas as to the constructive role that Congress can play on this important issue.Lastly, I have written a letter to Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Chair Murray and Vice Chair Collins urging their support for the President’s request for a 27% increase in funding for the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education in the next emergency supplemental funding package.Read the full letter to leadershiphere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Stands with UVM Graduate Student Workers Moving to Unionize
Date: November 8, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today sent aletterto University of Vermont (UVM) President Suresh Garimella in support of the nearly 650 graduate student workers attempting to form a union and win a seat at the bargaining table.

“In my view, it is more than appropriate that graduate students exercise their constitutional right to organize and achieve long needed improvements to stipends, benefits, and working conditions,” wrote Sanders. “For far too long, the trend in our higher education system has been going in the wrong direction: student workers are required to work longer hours for lower pay with weaker job security, all while taking on more and more debt. Too many graduate student workers have to take on two or even three jobs just to get by. In my view, stronger unions and worker protections are a key part of solving this crisis in our colleges and universities.”

Over the last few years, graduate students all across the country have voted to organize and a number of them have signed contracts with their universities. Graduate student workers play a critical role in the financial success of a university and the academic achievements of its student body. While being relied upon by UVM to conduct research, teach courses, and provide other essential work – all while maintaining a full course load – student workers pursuing a Master’s degree currently receive minimum 12-month stipends of just $27,850, and PhD student workers receive just $32,000.

In the letter, Sanders requested that President Garimella remain neutral throughout the bargaining process and ensure that these workers, who dedicate each day to the mission of the University, are able organize together free of any attempts to disrupt, delay, discourage, or otherwise hinder the election process.

“Now is the time for the University of Vermont to show up for its people, rather than stand against them,” Sanders concluded. Last April, Sanders alsosenta letter to interns, residents, and fellows of the UVM Medical Center in support of their efforts to form a union.

The White House will then evaluate the senators’ recommendations and announce a nominee. The Advisory Panel is now accepting applications for the expected vacancy, the duty station for which will be in Rutland.

“Federal judges are not only an essential part of our everyday lives, but are a key pillar of our democracy,”said Sanders and Welch.“We must continue to ensure that our state has a full complement of highly qualified judges on the federal bench, and a selection process based on merit and transparency ensures just that. I look forward to the judicial selection process in our state, a high-standard process that is a model for the rest of the country.”

Candidates interested in being considered for appointment to fill the vacancy should provide the Committee with a completed questionnaire, which is available on the VBA website athttps://www.vtbar.org/.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Senate Floor Speech on the Need to Lower the Cost of Prescription Drugs and for Major NIH Reform
Date: November 7, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 – Ahead of the final Senate confirmation vote today on nominee Dr. Monica Bertagnolli to serve as the Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, spoke on the floor of the Senate on the need to lower the cost of prescription drugs and the need for major NIH reform.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedHERE.M. President: The American people understand, whether they’re Democrats, Republicans or Independents that our health care system is broken, dysfunctional and failing. We spend almost twice as much per person as any other industrialized country on health care.While the insurance companies and drug companies make hundreds of billions in profits, we have 85 million Americans who are uninsured or under-insured, and over 60,000 people who die every year because they can’t get to a doctor on time.We don’t have enough doctors, nurses, dentists or mental health specialists. And, our life expectancy is far lower than most other countries and getting worse.Health care is a human right. And we need major reforms to the system so that every man, woman and child in this country gets the quality health care they need regardless of their financial status.The responsibility for reforming our broken health care system rests with many agencies of government including HHS, CMS, the FDA, and the National Institutes of Health – which plays a very important role in the development of new prescription drugs.While the ten largest drug companies made over $112 billion in profits last year and pay their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages, one out of four Americans cannot afford to pay for the medicine they need and thousands of families face financial ruin as they pay outrageous prices for the prescription drugs that keep them alive.Think about that for a second. Millions of people get sick. They go to the doctor who writes out a prescription. And yet because of the exorbitant prices that we pay, one out of four cannot fill that prescription. How insane is that?But it’s not just the high cost of prescription drugs impacting individuals. In the largest hospital in my state of Vermont, and I don’t think it’s terribly different elsewhere, the high cost of prescription drugs account for 20% of the overall budget which is driving hospital costs up and insurance costs up.In other words, the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in America is a crisis situation that must be addressed.Adding insult to injury, not only has the federal government not effectively regulated the price of prescription drugs but the taxpayers of this country have, over the years, provided hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development into new prescription drugs that have provided enormous benefits to some of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in America.For example, in America today, the median cost of new cancer drugs has gone up by more than 300 percent over the past decade even though 85 percent of the initial foundational cancer research is funded by U.S. taxpayers.In June, the HELP Committee released a report that found that the average price of new treatments that NIH scientists helped invent over the past 20 years is $111,000.In virtually all cases, American taxpayers are paying far more than people in other countries for the exact same medicine that the NIH helped develop.Here are just a few examples from this report:Astellas and Pfizer charge Americans with prostate cancer over $165,000 for Xtandi while the exact same drug can be purchased in Japan for just $20,000.Johnson & Johnson charges Americans with HIV $56,000 for Symtuza while the exact same treatment can be purchased in the United Kingdom for just $10,000.Millenium Pharmaceuticals charges Americans with cancer $54,000 for Velcade while the exact same drug can be purchased in France for just $11,000.In other words, American taxpayers fund the research for these drugs, but can’t afford the product they helped create.And after receiving $12 billion from the federal government, Moderna has quadrupled the price of the COVID vaccine – a vaccine that was literally co-invented by NIH scientists – to $128, while the exact same vaccine will, through the power of negotiation, be sold in Europe for as little as $26.Does anybody think that this process makes sense? If American taxpayer dollars helped develop a drug, we should be paying the lowest prices in the world not the highest.That is unacceptable and that has got to change. No prescription drug, no matter how effective and life-saving it may be, is worth anything to the patient who cannot afford it.In my view, at this very difficult moment for American health care, we need an NIH Director who is prepared to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and use every tool at their disposal to substantially lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs.The 1,800 well-paid lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry here in DC may not like it, but that is precisely what the American people need.The status quo is not working. We need fundamental changes in the way that the NIH addresses the crisis of the high cost of prescription drugs.Dr. Monica Bertagnolli is an intelligent and caring person. But she has not convinced me that she is prepared to take on the greed and power of the drug companies and health care industry and fight for the transformative changes the NIH needs at this critical moment. That is why I will be voting no on her confirmation – which we will soon be voting on.

Title: NEWS: Amid Humanitarian Disaster in Gaza, Sanders Urges World to Act
Date: November 1, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 – As the humanitarian disaster continues in Gaza, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in a speech on the Senate floor today called for the United States and the world to take action to address the immediate need to save lives, stop the bombing, bring forth a humanitarian pause, bring in critical aid, and lay out a path to bring peace and stability to the region.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

M. President,

The situation in Gaza today is a disaster. Congress must take action. The administration must take action. The world must take action.

Today, three weeks after Hamas’ barbaric attack against civilians in Israel – which began this war – many hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza are on the brink.

Over the past three weeks, it is estimated that some 8,000 people in Gaza have been killed in bombings – including more than 3,000 children – and far more have been wounded. More than one million people in Gaza have been displaced from their homes and some 670,000 people are sheltering in UN installations, where they are down to one liter of water per person, per day. They lack sufficient food, water, medical supplies, and fuel. The hospitals and medical facilities there are in nightmarish condition, with hundreds of babies in incubators and patients on life-support at risk of death, should the generators that sustain them run out of fuel. Corridors are lined with injured and displaced people, and overwhelmed doctors must turn patients away or operate without anesthesia or antibiotics.

The humanitarian crisis is dire, and getting worse by the minute. There must be a humanitarian pause, NOW, so that sufficient supplies – food, water, medicine, fuel – can reach the people of Gaza. If not, thousands more will die needlessly. We cannot allow that to happen. A stop to the bombing is critical to save innocent lives and secure the safe return of hostages.

M. President, let us never forget: the lives of all children—all people—are sacred, whether they are Palestinian children, Israeli children, or American children, and we must do everything we can to protect them.

But M. President, if we are going to make any real progress in addressing this never-ending conflict between Israel and Hamas – there have been five wars in the last fifteen years – we need to understand how we got to where we are today. If peace is to come to that troubled region, and if the Palestinian people are ever going to be able to enjoy lives of security and dignity, there must be a vision of where we go in the future.

Let’s be clear: the living conditions in Gaza before October 7th were horrific and inhumane – that was before Hamas ignited the latest war. Before this conflict, in Gaza, nearly 80 percent of people lived in poverty, and two-thirds were reliant on humanitarian assistance. Almost half the population, and over 70 percent of young people, were unemployed in Gaza. What kind of life could they look forward to? Electricity was intermittent, with 11- to 12-hour blackouts every day. Water and sanitation systems were inadequate, and there were constant shortages of all basic necessities. Gaza was mostly cut off from the world, with Israel and Egypt severely limiting the number of people and the types of goods that could go in or out. In fact, many observers described Gaza as “an open-air prison.” All of that is before October 7th.

M. President, if we are serious about bringing freedom and dignity to the Palestinian people, that is a situation that can never be allowed to be returned to. Palestinian people are entitled to much more than that.

In Gaza, Hamas, an authoritarian terrorist organization, ruled by force, stockpiling arms and war material, taxing the desperately poor population, and stealing resources to build tunnels and rockets. Make no mistake: Hamas is a terrorist organization bent on the destruction of Israel, and long before this horrific attack they had killed countless innocent people, including Americans. They advance a fundamentalist ideology which treats women as inferior, second-class citizens, and which threatens to kill people who are gay. Hamas is an authoritarian nightmare, repressing dissent and stealing from Gazans not just many materials of life but the dream of a better future.

That was the situation before October 7th.

And what was going on in Israel before Hamas’ terrorist attack? What was going on there? That country had the most right-wing government in its history, a cabinet that included outright racist ministers who consistently dehumanized the Palestinian population. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, was under indictment for a litany of corruption charges, and many believe that Israel’s intelligence failure on October 7th had everything to do with his government’s preoccupation with his political problems.

Before the war, this right-wing Israeli government had systematically undermined the prospects of peace. Netanyahu and his extreme partners in the cabinet had worked to marginalize Palestinian voices committed to peace, pursued settlement policies designed to foreclose the possibility of a two-state solution, stymied economic development in Palestinian areas, and passed laws that entrench systemic inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel.

This last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas the United Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. Despite that, the Israeli government authorized thousands of new homes for settlers and opened up new areas to construction, while bulldozing thousands of Palestinian homes and schools and further restricting Palestinian movement. Legal experts agree these policies constituted nothing less than illegal annexation.

All of these policies and more greatly increased tension in the West Bank: before October 7th, 179 Palestinians had been killed in 2023, which made it the deadliest year in two decades. Since October 7th, 121 more Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including some by settlers. These tensions were part of why so much of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) was deployed in the West Bank, rather than the border with Gaza.

Then came the October 7th and Hamas’ atrocities that began this latest and horrific war.

The Hamas attack was unspeakable. Over 1,300 innocent men, women, and children in Israel were killed. Over 200 Israelis and Americans taken hostage, including young children and grandparents. Young people were gunned down in cold blood at a music festival, babies and older people brutally murdered in their homes. And let’s remember that Hamas did not primarily target the military – no, they intentionally targeted civilians. Their goal was to kill civilians. Their attack was designed to provoke a response. And in that they succeeded.

M. President, many Israelis are now understandably furious and they want to strike back forcefully. I think we can all understand that. But rage and revenge do not make useful policy. Here in the United States after the attack on 9/11 in this country, we acted with rage and revenge, and I think many people now understand that was a horrific mistake.

M. President, killing innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not bring back to life the innocent Israeli women and children who have been killed by Hamas.

Like any other country, Israel has the right to defend itself and destroy Hamas terrorism. But it does not have the right to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza. Israel does not have the right to endanger the lives of millions of Palestinians – half of whom are children – by shutting off water, food, fuel, and electricity. That type of action against a helpless and impoverished population is morally unacceptable and in violation of international law. Israel does not have the right to bomb an entire neighborhood to target one Hamas leader or installation. But that is what the Israeli government is doing. One need only look at the satellite imagery and photography of Gaza to see that this is not a carefully calibrated campaign. These are not surgical strikes.

Yesterday, Israel struck the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp and killed a Hamas commander. But they also killed some 50 other people and injured hundreds more, though the exact toll is not yet known. That was actually the fourth airstrike on Jabalia: an October 9th airstrike killed 60, an October 19th airstrike killed 18, and an October 22nd airstrike killed 30, according to respected outside researchers. UNRWA—the United Nations relief agency—reported yesterday that their Head of Security was killed along with his wife and eight children. In total, 67 UNRWA workers have been killed and 44 facilities damaged since October 7th.

M. President, the current Israeli strategy must end. Israel must begin the process of restoring water and electrical services in areas where they are still operable. The international community must also rush generators and solar capacity to Gazan medical facilities, to address acute needs and reduce Israeli fears of diversion to Hamas. Israel will not stop going after Hamas, but it must do it in a very, very different way, and additional pauses will be needed.

M. President, let me conclude by saying that Israel must also begin the process of laying out a political strategy – it cannot bomb its way to a solution. Such a strategy must include, as minimum first steps: a clear promise that Palestinians displaced in the fighting will have the absolute right to safely return to their homes; a commitment to broader peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war; an abandonment of Israeli efforts to carve up and annex the West Bank; and a commitment to work with the Palestinian Authority to build genuine governing capacity.

The United States must make it clear that these are the conditions of our solidarity. Just as we want justice for the Israelis murdered by Hamas, we also want justice for the Palestinian people. That is not going to happen with Hamas. Palestinians need a state of their own, contiguous, with the freedom of movement and access that can sustain a vibrant economy.

M. President, this will be a long and difficult road. It will take concerted U.S. and international support, and a doubling down of our political commitment to a two-state solution.

But the first step – right now – must be to stop the bombing and bring in as much humanitarian aid as possible. I think Secretary Blinken said it well and he said, “Providing immediate aid and protection for Palestinian civilians in the conflict is a necessary foundation for finding partners in Gaza who have a different vision for the future than Hamas – and who are willing to help make it real.”

M. President, this is a dreadful situation. It is part of a very, very long-term conflict between Israel and its neighbors. But the immediate need is to save lives and stop the bombing, to bring forth a humanitarian pause, and then go forward to bring peace and stability to the region.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Balint Demand Answers from Postmaster General DeJoy on Plan for Montpelier Post Office, Addressing Postal Worker Safety Concerns, and Restoring Agency’s Ability to Meet Vermonters’ Basic Needs
Date: November 1, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 – Following the closure of the Montpelier Post Office, which was caused by the devastating summer flooding in Vermont, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) on Tuesday sent aletterto Postmaster General Louis DeJoy regarding the unacceptable response by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to serious worker safety concerns – including a lack of heat – and service disruptions.

“Since July, the Montpelier Post Office has been operating out of a series of temporary locations, which most recently consisted of two mobile units positioned on River Street in Montpelier. Despite messaging to the contrary, these mobile units remain inoperable, with no power to sustain air conditioning in the summer, heat in cold fall temperatures, or lighting needed to work inside,” wrote the Vermont Delegation. “While these mobile units have been completely unacceptable in terms of providing a safe workplace for your postal employees, they allowed for continued service needed by Montpelier residents. Now, your agency intends to close these temporary mobile units by the end of this week with no stated plan to reopen services in Montpelier. This abandonment of your employees and customers is completely unacceptable and must be rectified immediately.”

Sanders, Welch, and Balint continued: “While these requests today center around the immediate crisis of the planned closure of the temporary location in Montpelier, our concerns do not end there. People are already suffering from so many other unavoidable tragedies stemming from Vermont’s summer flooding. We urge you to take the necessary steps to restore Vermonters’ faith in your agency and the critical federal government services you provide.”

The Delegation called on DeJoy to provide workers in Montpelier – as well as post office box owners/holders, retail customers, municipal leadership, and the Delegation – with a firm timeline for reopening services in Montpelier that are safe, heated, electrified, and indoors by Friday, November 3. They also called for the immediate notification of USPS employees of their options to be placed on paid administrative leave, reassigned to nearby post offices, or otherwise made whole; and that the retail and post office box operations in Montpelier be reopened no later than Monday, November 13 in a temporary location agreed upon with the American Postal Workers Union.

Sanders, Welch, and Balint also called on DeJoy to address the ongoing failure of his leadership under which Vermont has seen the intentional undermining and deterioration of service as well as the demoralization of postal workers.

“The problems in Montpelier reflect a failure of national management that has become a pattern in our state,” the Delegation wrote. “For years, the Postal Service has left many of our rural communities unheard and underserved. We have consistently expressed our concerns over ongoing staffing shortages and extreme mail delays across Vermont, as well as the lack of proper resources for the USPS sorting facility in White River Junction.”

“Under your leadership, we have seen a persistent deterioration of USPS service and an intentional undermining of the very mission of your agency, which has demoralized your workforce and undermined Americans’ faith in your ability to meet their most basic needs. The City of Montpelier, the State of Vermont, and the United States as a whole need a functioning Postal Service.”

WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) today sent aletterto President Biden expressing serious concern about what the invasion and potential occupation of Gaza could mean, both in terms of the long-term security of Israel and the well-being of the Palestinian residents of the territory.

“Israel suffered a barbaric attack and is well within its rights to defend itself in keeping with international law, including the protection of civilians,” the senators wrote. “As a response, Israel is contemplating a large-scale ground invasion targeting Hamas. Reports indicate Israeli ground forces are already active in Gaza. We note recent reports that senior U.S. officials – including Secretary of Defense Austin – have conveyed to the Israeli government their serious concerns about the risks associated with this course. We share many of these concerns, not just relating to the timing and difficulty of such an operation and its likely humanitarian toll, but also regarding the difficult questions about the political reality it will leave in its wake.”

As Congress considers the administration’s emergency funding request, the senators requested answers to the following questions:

“The United States must take a leading role in charting out a future that respects the lives of Palestinians and Israelis alike,” wrote the senators.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 – As the United States Senate prepares an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to respond to the ongoing humanitarian and military crises in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and elsewhere, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent a letter to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urging that an equal amount of funding is included in that appropriations bill to address the urgent and growing emergencies facing the American people at home.

“The supplemental cannot just be about responding to emergencies abroad,” wrote the senators. “In America today, working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor are struggling to deal with major crises at home that demand our immediate attention. How can we tell our constituents who are struggling to pay for the basic necessities of life that Congress can immediately provide tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer funding to deal with emergencies abroad, but we somehow cannot afford to respond to the severe economic pain that they are feeling at home?”

The senators highlighted the following emergencies at home that should be addressed in the supplemental:

“We have a responsibility to act boldly to respond to ALL of the major emergencies we face – both at home and abroad,” the senators wrote.

Title: NEWS: Vermont Delegation Announces More Than $20 Million in Funds for Affordable Fuel Assistance in Vermont
Date: October 26, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 – With winter around the corner and heating costs projected to increase this season, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) today announced that Vermont will receive more than $20.7 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds.

“As Vermonters prepare for colder months, we are proud to announce this critical funding for home heating,” the Vermont delegation said in a joint statement. “Heating costs are rising, and we must do more to make sure all Vermonters have everything they need to get through winter. These funds will also help many Vermonters who are beginning to rebuild and recover after the devastating summer floods.”

The funding will help low-income individuals and families pay their home heating costs and also help with cooling bills in the summer. LIHEAP can also be used to weatherize homes to make them more energy efficient, and used during disasters and extreme weather to mitigate energy emergencies. The funding released includes funds appropriated for this year from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These “early release” funds represent a down payment on Vermont’s total annual share of LIHEAP funding, which will be determined once Congress passes a final appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024.

Ensuring LIHEAP funds are released ahead of winter has been a longstanding priority of the Vermont congressional delegation to enable low-income Vermonters and the agencies who serve them to have the funding they need to prepare for the cold temperatures ahead.

In addition to this funding, which was announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Community Services announced the launch of aLIHEAP Eligibility Toolthat allows households in Vermont and across the country to quickly identify if they might be eligible for LIHEAP assistance by inputting basic information like income and household size.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Asks Hospital Executives to Reconsider Decision Not to Testify at Senate HELP Committee Field Hearing in New Jersey on America’s Nursing Crisis
Date: October 26, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 – Ahead of tomorrow’s Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee field hearing in New Brunswick, New Jersey on the national nursing crisis, Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked Mark Manigan, the CEO of RWJBarnabas Health, and Alan Lee, the CEO of the non-profit Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, to reconsider their decision not to attend.

“I am disappointed that the executives at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital system, Mark Manigan and Alan Lee, declined to testify at tomorrow’s hearing,” Sanders said.

“There are a number of questions that I wanted to ask them. I was particularly interested in having them explain to the committee how it happens that they could afford to spend some $90 million on traveling nurses, but somehow could not afford to sign a fair contract with their own nurses to increase patient safety at their nonprofit hospital. I was also interested in learning how they could afford to pay their CEO over $17 million in compensation in 2021, but apparently cannot afford to mandate the same safe nurse-patient ratios that have been in place in California for nearly 20 years.

“We have been pleased to receive the written testimony from the hospital and that will be part of the record. But it is far more important that Mr. Manigan and Mr. Lee show up in person to respond to questions. I hope they will reconsider their decision not to testify.”

The field hearing comes as nurses and other health care workers around the country stand together and go on strike, including 1,700 nurses at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. Nurses at the hospital went out on the picket line on August 4 after hospital leadership refused to establish safe staffing levels and improve dangerous working conditions that have put the health of patients at risk.

Meanwhile, in 2021, the top five executives in the hospital system made $40 million in compensation and, instead of bargaining in good faith, are paying traveling nurses up to $300 an hour to replace striking workers.

The nursing crisis is a major focus of the HELP Committee under Sanders. In February, the committee held ahearingon the topic and Sandersmadenurses amajor focusof his work on historic legislation to help solve the primary care crisis in America.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Calls for Humanitarian Pause in Israel and Gaza
Date: October 25, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 – Given the disastrous humanitarian situation taking place in Gaza, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in a speech on the Senate floor today called for a humanitarian pause so that critical aid, including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies, can reach hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in desperate need.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

Let me take a minute to share with you my thoughts regarding the horrific situation in Israel and Gaza.

On October 7th, Hamas terrorists waged a barbarous attack against Israel, killing over 1,400 innocent men, women, and children. Young people at a music festival were machine-gunned down in cold blood, babies and older people were brutally murdered, and over 200 Israelis and Americans are being held as hostages. Some people describe the October 7th attack on Israel as the equivalent to the 9/11 terrorist attack against the United States. That is wrong. Israel is a small country with under ten million people. On a per capita basis, the 1,400 Israelis killed by Hamas would be the equivalent of over 40,000 Americans killed if Israel had the same size population as we do. On 9/11, as everybody recalls, we lost 3,000 people.

Let us be clear: Israel suffered a major attack and has, as do all other countries under similar circumstances, the absolute right to defend itself.

But, having the right to defend your country against a terrorist attack, and a terrorist organization like Hamas, does not mean having the right to violate international law and wage indiscriminate warfare against innocent men, women, and children in Gaza. The people of Israel have gone through a horrific and traumatic shock. It is understandable that they are furious and want to strike back forcefully. Revenge, however, is not a useful policy. Killing innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not bring back to life the innocent Israeli women and children who have been killed. It will only make a terrible situation even worse and more intractable.

Let us be clear: The Palestinian people today are experiencing nothing less than a humanitarian disaster. Thousands are already dead, including many children, and more are wounded. Hundreds of thousands have been forced out of their homes. These people, deeply impoverished before this war, now lack food, water, fuel, shelter, medicine, and other basic necessities. Unbelievably, more than 400,000 Palestinians, driven from their homes, are now sheltering in densely crowded U.N.-run schools. Dozens of medical facilities have been damaged, and 35 U.N. aid workers have been killed. The aid trickling into Gaza is just a fraction of what is needed. In a few days, hospitals will run out of fuel, and ventilators and incubators will shut off. This is a desperate, desperate situation. I echo Secretary Blinken’s call for the immediate release of all hostages. He also called for the consideration of a humanitarian pause by all parties. To my mind, a pause is essential for the protection of civilians as required by the laws of war, as well as for the provision of robust supplies of food, water, and medical aid to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel suffered a terrible attack, but the response must be carefully thought through and be carried out in line within international law. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, we allowed anger and rage to drive our response. This resulted in us making grave mistakes, in terms of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which cost us thousands of members of the U.S. military and the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in those countries. Israel has a right to defend itself and go after Hamas. But innocent Palestinians also have a right to life, security, and peace. Please remember, the last election held in Gaza was in 2006, when a majority of people in Gaza today were not yet born or could not vote. Even then, a minority voted for Hamas. Hamas is an authoritarian organization that does not necessarily represent a broad swathe of the Palestinian people, and we must not conflate all Palestinians with this terrorist organization.

Further, Israel is apparently contemplating an invasion and occupation of Gaza. I have very serious concerns about what this could mean in terms of the long-term security of Israel, the well-being of the Palestinian residents of Gaza, half of whom are children, and the hope that peace, security, and justice will at some point come to that region. In Congress, we will soon be voting on a package including billions of dollars for Israel, above and beyond the $3.8 billion in military aid the United States sends there every year. The American people have a right to know if that money will be used to defend Israel or whether it will be used for an invasion and occupation.

Israel’s proposed invasion will likely bring difficult, street-by-street fighting against entrenched Hamas fighters in a dense urban environment still populated by many civilians. Hamas will continue to use human shields and its extensive tunnel network, and will likely resort to insurgent tactics. As two experts on the subject recently wrote, “the battle will not end when Israel has reoccupied the territory. There is no Palestinian entity that Israel trusts to govern Gaza in Hamas’s stead. As a result, a military victory could mean Israel has to administer the territory for the foreseeable future. Israeli officials, in other words, will have to govern an immiserated people who see them as their enemy and who may wage a guerrilla war.”

I have serious concerns about what this invasion and potential occupation of Gaza will mean, both in terms of the long-term security of Israel and the well-being of the Palestinian residents of Gaza. In Congress, as we consider a package including billions of dollars for Israel that could fund this invasion and occupation, we clearly need much more information about Israel’s long-term plans and goals, as well as the United States Government’s assessments of those prospects.

Some of the questions that need to be answered are:• How many innocent men, women, and children will be killed or wounded if Israel engages in an invasion and occupation?• How many Israeli soldiers will be killed or wounded in a ground operation?• How will many hundreds of thousands of civilians receive the food, water, fuel, and medical care they need in the midst of what could be extremely heavy urban warfare in a very densely populated area?• How long will it take to establish military control of Gaza, and what level of insurgent activity is anticipated from that point?• How will the success of the operation be measured?• Are there alternative approaches to a ground invasion that would be effective in assuring Israel’s long-term security?• What will this operation mean for the hostages still being held in Gaza?• What political force will administer Gaza after an Israeli operation?• Will the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have been driven from their homes be guaranteed safe return?• What impact will the invasion and occupation of Gaza have on the international community’s support for Israel?• How will the international community address the ongoing human needs in Gaza—and the rest of Palestine—when the shooting and bombs stop?• What political process will follow this conflict, and what is the desired end-state in Gaza?As Congress considers the administration’s emergency funding request, we need answers to these questions.

This is tragically the fifth conflict between Israel and Hamas in fifteen years. Clearly, a terrorist organization like Hamas cannot be the answer to the very serious problems facing the people of Gaza. Just a few months ago, thousands of people defied Hamas’ authoritarian rule to protest on the streets of Gaza. Their voices are silenced now, but there can be no long-term solution to this ongoing crisis without a serious effort to address Palestinian demands for peace, legitimate political representation, and a vibrant economy. The United States must take a leading role in charting out a future that respects the lives of Palestinians and Israelis alike.

We can start by answering the questions laid out above. And I very much look forward to receiving a briefing from the administration, in a classified setting as needed, in order for members of Congress to understand what an invasion and occupation would look like.

We are living in a horrifically difficult moment in the Middle East. I can understand the outrage that many people in Israel are feeling following the attack that killed 1,400 of their people. Now is the time in Israel and the United States for us to not allow revenge and rage to dictate our policy, but to really think this complex issue through.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today released the following statement ahead of tomorrow’scommittee markupof Dr. Monica Bertagnolli’s nomination to serve as Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH):Our health care system is broken and dysfunctional. We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, while over 60,000 Americans die every year because they can’t get to a doctor when they should. Despite our huge health care expenditures, our life expectancy, especially for working families, is below most other wealthy nations – and is declining. Further, the taxpayers of this country provide over $45 billion a year to the NIH for research and development that leads to prescription drugs and treatments. Yet, we pay the highest prices in the world for the drugs U.S. taxpayers help to develop and one out of four Americans cannot afford to buy the drugs their doctors prescribe.Dr. Monica Bertagnolli is an intelligent and caring person, but has not convinced me that she is prepared to take on the greed and power of the drug companies and health care industry and fight for the transformative changes the NIH needs at this critical moment. I intend to vote NO at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday. I have not asked any member of the Committee to follow my lead. This should be a vote of conscience.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Sends Letter to HHS Inspector General Urging Investigation of Exclusive Patent License for NIH-funded Cancer Therapy
Date: October 23, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today sent a letter to Christi Grimm, Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), urging a thorough investigation into the National Institutes of Health (NIH) after the NIH proposed, in the Federal Register, granting an exclusive patent license to an obscure company linked to a former employee for a treatment for cervical cancer that could potentially be worth hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.

Under the Bayh-Dole Act, the NIH is only supposed to provide an exclusive license to a private company on government-owned inventions when the monopoly would be a “reasonable and necessary incentive” to help advance the product.

“There does not appear to be anything reasonable and necessary about granting a monopoly for a treatment that was invented, manufactured and tested by the NIH, is already in late stage trials and could potentially enrich a former NIH employee who was one of the major government researchers of this treatment,” Sanders wrote. “Based on current law and the best interest of U.S. taxpayers who paid for this cancer therapy, it would seem to make more sense for the NIH to offer non-exclusive licenses so that multiple manufacturers can produce this important cancer therapy at reasonable and affordable prices. The apparent abuse of the system by the NIH with respect to the exclusive patent license for this cancer therapy is so egregious that it has been characterized as a ‘how-to-become-a-billionaire program run by the NIH.’”

“If accurate,” Sanders wrote, “that would be absolutely unacceptable. The NIH should be doing everything within its authority to lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. It should not be granting a monopoly on a promising taxpayer-funded therapy that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for cancer patients in a way that appears to exceed its statutory authority.”

As stated in Chairman Sanders’ letter, this treatment for cervical cancer was invented, manufactured, and tested by the NIH. Alarmingly, one of the leading NIH researchers of this cancer treatment appears to have a direct relationship with the company, Scarlet TCR, and may gain a massive financial windfall as a result of this exclusive patent license.

Sanders requested that the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services immediately initiate an investigation into this matter.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Opening Statement in Hearing to Consider NIH Nominee
Date: October 18, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led the committee in a hearing to consider the nomination of Dr. Monica Bertagnolli to serve as Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.

This morning we will be considering the nomination of Dr. Monica Bertagnolli to serve as the Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Let me begin by welcoming Dr. Bertagnolli to our committee. We look forward to hearing from you and we thank you for being here today.

The NIH, with a budget of more than $47 billion, is the largest funder of medical research in the world.

This research has led to new treatments and prescription drugs that have significantly improved the lives of the people in America and throughout the world. Every American should take great pride in those accomplishments.

But, having said that, let me say a few words about my concerns. The American health care system is broken and failing. We spend almost twice as much as any other industrialized country per capita on health care. Yet, we have 85 million Americans who are uninsured or under-insured, we don’t have enough doctors, nurses, dentists, or mental health specialists. And, very relevant to this hearing, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – sometimes ten times more than the people of other countries.

While the ten largest drug companies made over $112 billion in profits last year and pay their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages, one out of four Americans cannot afford to pay for the medicine they need and thousands of families face financial ruin as they pay outrageous prices for the prescription drugs that keep them alive.

Think about that for a second. Millions of people get sick. They go to the doctor who writes out a prescription. And yet because of the exorbitant prices that we pay, one out of four cannot fill that prescription. How insane is that?

But it’s not just the high cost of prescription drugs impacting individuals. In the largest hospital in my state of Vermont, and I don’t think it’s terribly different elsewhere, the high cost of prescription drugs account for 20% of the overall budget which is driving hospital costs up and insurance costs up.

In other words, the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in America is a crisis situation that must be addressed.

Adding insult to injury, not only has the federal government not effectively regulated the price of prescription drugs but the taxpayers of this country have, over the years, provided hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development into new prescription drugs that have provided enormous benefits some of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in America.

For example, in America today, the median cost of new cancer drugs has gone up by more than 300 percent over the past decade even though 85 percent of the initial foundational cancer research is funded by U.S. taxpayers.

In June, this Committee released a report that found that the average price of new treatments that NIH scientists helped invent over the past 20 years is $111,000.

In virtually all cases, American taxpayers are paying far more than people in other countries for the exact same medicine that the NIH helped develop.

Here are just a few examples from this report:

Astellas and Pfizer charge Americans with prostate cancer over $165,000 for Xtandi while the exact same drug can be purchased in Japan for just $20,000. In other words, American taxpayers fund the research, but can’t afford the product they helped create.

Johnson & Johnson charges Americans with HIV $56,000 for Symtuza while the exact same treatment can be purchased in the United Kingdom for just $10,000.

Gilead charges Americans with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma $424,000 for Yescarta while the exact same therapy can be purchased in Japan for just $212,000.

Millennium Pharmaceuticals charges Americans with cancer $54,000 for Velcade while the exact same drug can be purchased in France for just $11,000.

Sobi is charging Americans with severe mouth sores $19,000 for Kepivance while the exact same drug can be purchased in Italy for just $5,000.

And after receiving $12 billion from the federal government, Moderna has quadrupled the price of the COVID vaccine – a vaccine that was literally co-invented by NIH scientists – to $128, while the exact same vaccine will, through the power of negotiation, be sold in Europe for as little as $26.

Does anybody think that this process makes sense? If American taxpayer dollars helped develop a drug, we should be paying the lowest prices in the world, not the highest.

That is unacceptable and that has got to change. No prescription drug, no matter how effective and life-saving it may be, is worth anything to the patient who cannot afford it.

In my view, at this very difficult moment for American health care, we need an NIH Director who is prepared to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and use every tool at his or her disposal to substantially lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs.

The 1,800 well-paid lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry here in DC may not like it, but that is precisely what the American people need.

The status quo is not working. We need fundamental changes in the way that the NIH addresses the crisis of the high cost of prescription drugs.

We need an NIH Director who is prepared to reinstate and expand the reasonable pricing clause to make sure that pharmaceutical companies set reasonable prices for new prescription drugs developed with taxpayer support.

We need an NIH Director who is prepared to use march-in rights to allow companies to manufacture low-cost generic versions of prescription drugs like Xtandi that were also developed with taxpayer support.

There is a lot of discussion about how “divided” our nation is and, on many issues, that is absolutely true.

But on one of the most important matters facing our country, the American people outside the beltway – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Conservatives – could not be more united. They want Congress and the Administration to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and to substantially lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs – period. And a new director of the NIH can play a very important role in making that happen.

Dr. Bertagnolli, I look forward to hearing your testimony and asking you questions in a few moments.

Senator Cassidy, you are recognized for your opening statement.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on the Field Hearing on the Nursing Crisis in New Jersey and Throughout the Country

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, issued the following statement today on next week’s committeehearingin New Jersey:As the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I look forward to a very important hearing in New Brunswick, New Jersey on Friday, October 27th to discuss the issues of national significance being raised by the nurses’ strike at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital which has now gone on for over two months.This country faces a major workforce crisis in health care. We do not have enough doctors, dentists, mental health practitioners, and pharmacists. Perhaps most disturbingly, we have a major and growing shortage of nurses – the people who are on the frontlines of our health care system.As Chairman of the Committee, I am working hard, in a bipartisan way, to increase the number of nurses in this country and to retain the nursing workforce we have.Tragically, we are losing hundreds of thousands of qualified nurses who are no longer comfortable in doing their jobs. Many of them feel that their working conditions are deplorable and that they are unable, because of inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios, to provide the quality of care their patients deserve.When nurses at Robert Wood Johnson tell me that their hospital has become a dangerous place for both patients to seek care and nurses to do their jobs because of totally inadequate staffing levels, it is imperative that the Senate HELP Committee pursue this issue – because this is a crisis facing not just one hospital, but hospitals throughout the country.At this hearing, I look forward to hearing from the nurses as well as the hospital management. I am especially interested in hearing from Mark Manigan, the President of RWJBarnabas Health which owns the Robert Wood Johnson University nonprofit hospital. I look forward to hearing how his health care system could afford to spend over $17 million on CEO compensation in 2021 and how his hospital could afford $87 million on traveling nurses since the strike began, but somehow cannot afford to mandate safe staffing ratios to improve the lives of patients and health care workers.I am also curious to know why nurses are on strike for better nurse-patient ratios at a hospital system that made over $4 billion in revenue over the first six months of this year and over $7.5 billion in revenue last year. To my mind, that is more than enough money to treat its nurses and frontline health care workers with the dignity and the respect they deserve.What nurses in New Jersey, Vermont, and all over this country have told me is that they have been stretched to the breaking point. They tell me that they are stressed out, burnt out, and are leaving the profession they love in droves because they are overworked, undervalued, and are forced each and every day to do more with less.This is a crisis that must be dealt with, and I look forward to the Committee shining a light on this crisis and how we can best address it.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: As Nurses Strike for Safer Working Conditions at Hospitals, Sanders to Hold Senate HELP Committee Field Hearing in New Jersey on America’s Nursing Crisis

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, announced today that on Friday, October 27 the committee will hold a field hearing in New Brunswick, New Jersey entitled “Overworked and Undervalued: Is the Severe Hospital Staffing Crisis Endangering the Well-Being of Patients and Nurses?”The field hearing comes as health care workers around the country stand together and go on strike, including 1,700 nurses at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. Nurses at the hospital went out on the picket line on August 4 after hospital leadership refused to establish safe staffing levels and improve dangerous working conditions that have put the health of patients at risk.Meanwhile, in 2021, the top five executives in the hospital system made $40 million in compensation and, instead of bargaining in good faith, are paying traveling nurses up to $300 an hour to replace striking workers.In addition to hearing directly from striking nurses and nurses who won safe staffing protections, the HELP Committee has invited executives from the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital to testify.“Nurses in New Jersey and all over America have been stretched to the breaking point as a result of unsafe and totally inadequate staffing levels that threaten the health of patients and cause massive burnout among health care workers,” Sanders said. “That has got to change. What the nurses at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital are asking for is not radical. For the sake of patient safety, they need strong nurse-to-patient staffing ratios.”The nursing crisis is a major focus of the HELP Committee under Sanders.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Sends Letter to Federal Call Center Contractor on Worker Demands for Better Pay
Date: October 5, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 – After Maximus, a major contractor that operates call centers for the federal government, failed to respect its workers constitutional right to organize, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today sent a letter to the company’s CEO Bruce Caswell requesting information on Maximus’s failure to respond to workers’ demands as they continue to fight for better compensation and working conditions.

Maximus currently holds contracts with dozens of federal agencies as well as state and local governments in all 50 states. Approximately 47 percent of Maximus’s 2022 revenue came from federal government contracts and 35 percent from state and local government contracts. Nearly 18,000 workers fulfill Maximus’s federal government contracts alone. Of these, approximately 10,000 work in 11 call centers, fulfilling Maximus’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contract, which it initially acquired from General Dynamics Information Technology in 2018. Maximus, operating as Advantage, is also the largest student loan servicer in the world, managing loans of over 13 million borrowers and totaling nearly $450 billion.

“Maximus’s failure to provide sufficient compensation and workplace protections for its workers has been the source of widespread reporting and worker discontent, even as the company has received many lucrative federal contracts,” Sanders wrote. “Maximus must commit to better wages and working conditions for workers, and to follow the law and respect workers’ right to organize.”

In 2022, Maximus spent $96 million in stock buybacks and $69 million on stock dividends. That same year, Caswell received over $6.2 million in total compensation and the other four top executives at Maximus received over $1 million each in total compensation. Meanwhile, Maximus workers make an average $16.20 an hour. The median employee received total compensation of $39,019, for a CEO-to-median-employee compensation ratio of 161 to 1.

Workers at Maximus CMS call centers have been organizing to form a union with Communications Workers of America Union (CWA) since 2019. They went on their first-ever strike in March 2022 to protest Maximus’s union busting and to demand paid sick leave, pay parity with other federal contractors, and better health insurance. CWA has filed several complaints with the National Labor Relations Board related to the call center organizing actions, including two charges following the August 2022 strike, claiming Maximus disciplined and intimidated striking workers and one alleging Maximus offered $200 bonuses to workers who worked on November 1 rather than striking.

In May 2020, Sanders signed on to a letter seeking information on steps Maximus was taking to protect its call center workers from COVID-19 following call center closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks and reports that Maximus employees were unable to socially distance and provided with inadequate sanitation supplies.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Kaine, Ocasio-Cortez, Castro, Casar, Velázquez Introduce Resolution Commemorating Coup in Chile
Date: September 21, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 – Following the 50th anniversary of the bloody U.S.-backed coup d’état against democratically-elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), and Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.) on Thursday introduced a Congressional resolution commemorating the coup, apologizing for the role the United States played, and calling for more transparency and further declassification of remaining U.S. records relating to events leading up to, during, and after the military coup.

The 1973 coup in Chile ushered in decades of military rule by General Augusto Pinochet, during which some 40,000 Chileans were killed, disappeared, tortured, or exiled. According to reports, President Richard Nixon ordered the CIA to “make the economy scream” and covertly block Allende’s inauguration through instigation of a military coup. Under the supervision of security adviser Henry Kissinger, the CIA continued its efforts to foster a “coup climate” and, in Kissinger’s own words to Nixon, “created the conditions as great as possible” for the military takeover.

Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) co-sponsored the resolution.

“Let me be clear: we must stand up for democracy here in the United States and beyond,”said Sanders.“And that means we must also acknowledge that the United States has not always defended democracy abroad, and in fact, has sometimes done the opposite. As we mark the 50th anniversary of the horrific coup in Chile, we must make clear that we regret our involvement and commit to supporting Chilean democracy. To build the lasting partnerships we need in this hemisphere, we will need to establish a basis of trust and respect. Part of that process includes full accountability for the coup and its aftermath.”

“This year marks 50 years since the 1973 coup in Chile. The Pinochet regime was responsible for horrendous human rights abuses and political suppression, including the murder of American citizens in Chile and targeted assassinations of political opponents within the United States,”said Kaine.“It is important that we acknowledge the United States’ role in the coup, but also learn from the U.S. Congress’s crucial role in ultimately bringing the regime’s atrocities to light, in order to strengthen our foreign policy in the future and be a better voice for human rights at home and abroad.”

Ocasio-Cortez said:“The U.S. cannot credibly show up as trustworthy partner that can help advance democracy in the present if we don’t own up to our complicated past. While we appreciate President Biden listening to our call and declassifying two relevant documents, there are still many outstanding questions. The people of Chile and the victims of Pinochet’s violence deserve answers.”

“Last month, I visited Chile with one of the first Congressional delegations led by leaders who came of age with a clear-eyed understanding of how America’s Cold War policy affected our neighbors. The legacy of American involvement in the region loomed large over our trip, but there was also a real willingness to build a relationship with the United States that looks beyond the Cold War,”said Castro.“If the United States is serious about building trust in Latin America, we have to be honest about our past. We need to help Chile heal by providing as much transparency as possible about the 1973 coup – and our role in Pinochet’s rise.”

“Fifty years ago the U.S. government supported a violent coup that toppled democracy in Chile and brought years of mass murder and authoritarianism to the country,”said Casar.“We should apologize and be transparent about the role that the U.S. government and major economic interests played in supporting the coup and the following years of authoritarian rule. Together, we can build a new relationship based on mutual respect and a commitment to peace.”

“U.S. involvement in the bloody overthrow of democracy in Chile in 1973 helped usher in an era of horrific violence and authoritarianism. Last month, I traveled to Santiago, where the coup and resulting Pinochet dictatorship have left deep scars on Chilean society. For Chile to heal and the relationship between our two countries to prosper, we need complete transparency about the role of the U.S. in overthrowing President Allende,”said Velázquez.

Earlier this month, Chilean President Gabriel Boric issued a fervent defense of democracy, stressing that the problems of democracy must be addressed through more democracy. The U.S. must always stand firmly on the side of those committed to democracy and the rule of law.

The resolution expresses profound regret for the U.S. contribution to destabilizing Chile’s political institutions and constitutional processes and recognizes the decades-long effort of Chile’s pro-democracy forces, applauding the Chilean people for rebuilding a strong and resilient democracy. It also vows that Congress will continue to engage with the Chilean people to participate in truth and reconciliation efforts, emphasizing that support for human rights is and should remain a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy not only in Chile, but across the globe.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Corporate Media Coverage of Pending UAW Strike
Date: September 12, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Tuesday issued the following statement on the corporate media’s coverage of the negotiations between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the Big 3 carmakers:One of the major crises facing our country is that eight large media conglomerates control 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, and read. And that kind of corporate ownership is now being seen clearly in the coverage of the labor conflict between the United Auto Workers and the Big 3 automakers.I find it interesting that the major reasons as to why autoworkers might go out on strike have been rarely, if ever, the focus of the corporate media’s coverage of the conflict, so let me list some of them.In the first half of 2023, the Big 3 automakers made a combined $23 billion in profits – up 80 percent from the same time period last year. But if you’ve watched any corporate news coverage of the pending strike by 150,000 autoworkers, you’ve heard more about the strikes’ potential negative effects on the economy and a litany of excuses why very well-compensated CEOs just can’t make a fair deal.You won’t hear that last year the CEO of General Motors raked in about $29 million in total compensation, the CEO of Ford made approximately $21 million, and the CEO of Stellantis pocketed over $25 million. In fact, over the last four years pay for those CEOs has increased by more than 40 percent.You won’t hear that over the past decade these same companies made some $250 billion in profits in North America alone.You won’t hear that the average starting wage at the Big 3 today is around $17 an hour – less than a number of non-union auto plants around the country – and that the top wage is $32.32 an hour.You won’t hear that, unbelievably, over the last 20 years, the average wage for American autoworkers has decreased by 30 percent after adjusting for inflation.You won’t hear that autoworkers at the Big 3 are earning less today than they did 15 years ago.Of course, none of this is new. The corporate media will always side with CEOs and shareholders. Every time working Americans stand up and demand what is just and fair, the corporate media is there to tell viewers that workers are asking for too much.Despite what you might hear in the corporate media in the coming days, what the UAW is fighting for is not radical. It is the totally reasonable demand that autoworkers, who have made enormous financial sacrifices over the past 40 years, finally receive a fair share of the record-breaking profits their labor has generated.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Balint Urge Congressional Leadership to Support More Aid for Vermont Flood Recovery in Supplemental Bill
Date: September 12, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (VT-AL) on Monday sent aletterto majority, minority, and Appropriations Committee leadership in the Senate and House of Representatives urging them to ensure that Congress passes federal funding for essential recovery and long-term disaster mitigation work in Vermont following the devastating flooding that hit the state this summer. In the letter, the delegation also called for increasing the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) cap for hazard mitigation, making Small Business Administration (SBA) loans forgivable in order to save small businesses, renters, and homeowners from taking on additional debt after experiencing a disaster, and expanding the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) emergency grant relief for impacted Vermont farmers, as well as opening eligibility for retroactive enrollment in the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program.“As Vermont continues to respond to, and begins the recovery from, ongoing catastrophic flooding, we urge you to pass federal funding that meets the needs of our state, with a significant focus on funding for long-term disaster recovery and mitigation work. We ask you to move this funding expeditiously, so important federal resources for disaster response and recovery become available to states like Vermont as quickly as possible,” wrote the Vermont congressional delegation to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Vice Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chair of the House Appropriations Committee Kay Granger (R-Texas), and Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).The flash flooding Vermont experienced from July 7 through August 8 impacted more than 5,000 individuals and families, led to over 200 water rescues, nearly 90 road closures along major routes, and damage to over 200 miles of rail in the state-owned rail system. The initial estimate from the state on flood-related damages is currently totaling in the many hundreds of millions of dollars. Small businesses, farming and rural communities, and individuals all suffered heavy losses, including anywhere between 145,000 and 686,000 acres of agricultural land across the state. Water and wastewater infrastructure was also severely damaged, including the wastewater facility in Johnson, which was completely destroyed and will likely cost upward of $10 million to replace. State inspectors have classified five dams as high hazard and 22 as significant hazards — leaving the state at significant risk for loss of life and property during future storms.Vermont’s congressional delegation also urged for support in investments in mitigation activities to build long-term resiliency against future disasters and the increasingly dangerous effects of climate change.Sanders, Welch, and Balint concluded: “While the damage assessments and needs are ongoing, we appreciate your support for the authorization and appropriation of all additional federal disaster recovery and mitigation dollars that Vermont will need for years to come. Thank you for your consideration of our request and for your support of Vermont’s response and recovery process.”Read the letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Balint Announce $9.9 Million Investment Championed by Leahy for New Aviation and Aerospace Manufacturing Workforce Training Center in Burlington School District
Date: September 11, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 11 – Secured by former Senator and Chair of theSenateAppropriations Committee Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) through the Congressionally Directed Spending Process, the Vermont Congressional Delegation today announced $9.9 million will be invested in the Burlington School District to educate and train the next generation in aviation and aerospace manufacturing. Administered by the United States Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal funds will build a new aviation and aerospace manufacturing workforce training center that aims to serve up to 150 Vermont high school students and adults each year.This investment will strengthen the local economy, create new career opportunities for young people and adult Vermonters, and help retain and propel forward Vermont’s combined $2 billion aerospace and aviation industry which supports over 9,500 jobs in the state.“I was proud to include funding for this Burlington aviation workforce training center in the FY22 Appropriations bill,”said Leahy.“The center will offer students and adults interested in aerospace careers the skills they need for aviation jobs, a growing industry in Vermont that I have always been proud to support. In recent years, we have seen an explosive growth in job opportunities at Burlington Airport – in large part thanks to BETA which is leading the way in the development and production of eVTOL aircraft.”Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (Vt.-AL) said: “Burlington School District’s new training center will open up job opportunities in Vermont and show our next generation of aviation technicians and manufacturers that the sky is the limit. Training young people in new and emerging technologies, and reskilling workers in the field are equally essential to fostering a strong workforce in Vermont. The Vermonters trained here will play an important role in securing Vermont’s sustainable future through the growth of electric aviation. This investment is thanks to the dedication of Senator Leahy and his staff, the Burlington School District, and our forward-thinking, community-based aviation and aerospace industries in Vermont.”The new center will train Vermonters in avionics, maintenance, repair and overhaul, and airframe and power plant skills – helping to close the skills gap and workforce labor shortage in the aviation and aerospace manufacturing industries, and create jobs in Vermont. Graduates will be able to enter careers in commercial, military, government, and private aviation, and use connections with the Vermont college system to gain higher degrees and qualifications in these fields.

BURLINGTON, Vt., Aug. 29 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday issued the following statement after the Biden Administration announced the first ten prescription drugs that will be subject to price negotiations between Medicare and drug manufacturers:“While the pharmaceutical industry makes huge profits every year, the American people pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And that situation is getting worse. Last year, the median price of new drugs approved by the FDA was over $220,000.“The Inflation Reduction Act will enable Medicare to negotiate prices for ten major drugs in 2026, and will save Medicare many billions of dollars. This is not a radical idea. It is something the Veterans Administration has been doing for 30 years, and what every major country on Earth does.“While this is an important step forward in taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and their 1,800 paid lobbyists in Washington, D.C., much more has to be done to protect the American people. Bottom line: We should not be paying any more for prescription drugs than other countries around the world. As the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues to make that happen.”

Manigan urging him to bargain in good faith with United Steel Workers (USW) Local 4-200 and come to an agreement on a fair contract for nurses at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) – one that provides for safe staffing standards, living wages, and quality, affordable health care. Since August 4, nearly 2,000 nurses at RWJUH, one of the largest hospitals in New Jersey, have been forced to resort to striking over unfair labor practices.“Let’s be clear: If RWJBH can afford to hire these replacement nurses and pay their executives millions each year, they can afford a contract that keeps nurses safe and provides living wages and good benefits,” wrote Sanders. “These workers have been on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19 and have risked their lives to save patients under challenging conditions. They deserve better.”While RWJBH continues to make millions in revenues, the wages for RWJUH nurses are not keeping pace with the rising cost of living. The nurses have also reported unfair restrictions on their health care plans and reduced staffing to the point that nurses across the hospital are now caring for unsafe numbers of patients.Instead of negotiating in good faith, the hospital offered $1 an hour raises for on-call shifts only, which, after adjusting for inflation, would amount to a significant pay cut. Rather than agreeing to safe staffing ratios, the hospital’s most recent offer instead effectively penalizes nurses for using the sick time to which they are legally entitled.Concluded Sanders: “I urge RWJUH to return to the negotiating table and bargain in good faith and end its unfair labor practices. This is your opportunity to do the right thing and work with your employees to improve your hospital for workers and patients. I look forward to your response.”Read the full letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Vermont Delegation Urges President Biden to Support More Aid for Vermont Flood Recovery in Disaster Supplemental Bill
Date: August 9, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Aug 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (VT-AL) today sent aletterto President Joe Biden urging him to work closely with Congress to secure supplemental disaster aid for urgent flood recovery and long-term disaster mitigation in Vermont. This letter comes as Congress must act to provide additional federal funding for agencies that respond to disasters and follows Sanders and Welch’sletterto Senate colleagues to approve such additional aid for the state.In the letter, Sanders, Welch, and Balint wrote: “As Vermont continues to respond to, and begins the recovery from, ongoing catastrophic flooding, we urge you to request ample funding from Congress for a disaster supplemental appropriations bill that meets the needs of our state, with a significant focus on funding for long-term disaster response and mitigation work. We ask you to work closely with Congress to move this funding bill expeditiously, so important federal resources for disaster response and recovery become available to states like Vermont as quickly as possible.”From the damage done to homes, businesses, farms, drinking water systems, wastewater infrastructure, roads, bridges, and dams, to the more than 4,000 individuals and families impacted by the disaster, the letter also outlined the terrible impact the floods have had on Vermonters across the state. To date, damage is still being reported and state and federal partners are working diligently to conduct damage assessments and loss estimates. This work will help individuals, small businesses, and non-profits begin to rebuild, as well as ensure the state of Vermont can make investments in recovery efforts that will make its infrastructure more resilient to future disasters. The delegation continues to work closely with the Scott Administration on these efforts, and is grateful to all the federal, state, and municipal employees who have been a part of this effort, as well as countless volunteers.In addition to Vermont’s immediate recovery needs, the Congressional Delegation urged President Biden to support investments in mitigation activities to build long-term resiliency against future disasters and the increasingly dangerous effects of climate change.“Vermont experienced severe flash floods beginning on July 7 that have continued to this day,” continued Sanders, Welch, and Balint. “The immediate impacts were nothing short of catastrophic, requiring over 200 water rescues, nearly 90 road closures along major routes, and damage to over 200 miles of rail in the state-owned rail system. We greatly appreciate your support in moving quickly to approve the Major Disaster Declaration and to get Vermont the initial funding needed for immediate response, without which we believe the state would have experienced significantly more destruction. Unfortunately, the long-term impacts of the disaster are proving to be just as catastrophic…While the damage assessments and needs are ongoing, we appreciate any support you may offer for the authorization and appropriation of all additional federal disaster recovery and mitigation dollars that Vermont will need for years to come.”According to reports, the White House is expected to formally announce their funding request for domestic disaster relief in the coming days.Read the full letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Markey, Merkley, and Warren Send Letter to Attorney General Urging DOJ to Bring Lawsuits Against the Fossil Fuel Industry
Date: July 31, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 31 – Amid record breaking heat levels, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Monday sent a letter to United States Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to bring lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry for its longstanding and carefully coordinated campaign to mislead consumers and discredit climate science in pursuit of massive profits.

“The actions of ExxonMobil, Shell, and potentially other fossil fuel companies represent a clear violation of federal racketeering laws, truth in advertising laws, consumer protection laws, and potentially other laws, and the Department must act swiftly to hold them accountable for their unlawful actions,” the senators wrote. “The fossil fuel industry has had scientific evidence about the dangers of climate change and the role that burning fossil fuels play in increasing global temperatures for more than 50 years.”

In 1959, Edward Teller warned the American Petroleum Institute that carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels would raise global temperatures. In 1975, Shell-backed research concluded that increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations could cause global temperature increases that would drive “major climatic changes” and compared the dangers of burning fossil fuels to nuclear waste. Beginning in the late 1970s, Exxon – now ExxonMobil – conducted extensive research on climate change that predicted current rising temperatures “correctly and skillfully.”

As stated in a lawsuit filed by the State of Minnesota, the fossil fuel industry “spent millions on advertising and public relations because they understood that an accurate understanding of climate change would affect their ability to continue to earn profits by conducting business as usual.”

The fossil fuel industry’s illegal, coordinated campaign of misinformation has proven tremendously profitable. From 1990 to 2019, the six largest private fossil fuel companies made $2.4 trillion in profits. In 2022, Exxon alone made $56 billion in profits – a record high for a western oil company. Shell reported record earnings of $39.9 billion. Chevron made a record $36.5 billion and BP made a record $27.7 billion.

This summer, over 100 million Americas have beenunderheat alerts. States such as Texas, Florida, and Arizona haveseenrecord heat temperatures shattered. June was the hottest ever in NOAA’sclimate record, and the year 2023 is expected to be the warmest year on record.

Title: NEWS: More Than 13,000 Vermonters Join Telephone Town Meeting on Flood Disaster Response with Sanders, Welch, Balint, Scott, and Agency Leaders
Date: July 28, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 28 – On Wednesday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders hosted a statewide telephone town meeting on Vermont’s flooding disaster with Sen. Peter Welch, Representative Becca Balint, and Governor Phil Scott, as well as federal and state agency leaders playing a critical part in the response and recovery process. Nearly 12,000 Vermonters from across the state joined the town meeting by phone, while thousands more listened in bylivestream.Before opening it up to questions, Sanders, Welch, Balint, and Scott, as well as leaders from FEMA, SBA, and USDA in Vermont, gave opening remarks and updates on the response and recovery process. During the town meeting, news was also announced that Orleans County has been added by FEMA to the federal Individual Assistance DisasterDeclarationsigned by President Biden earlier this month. This means that residents of Orleans County are now able to apply for federal assistance for personal losses incurred during the flooding. Caledonia, Chittenden, Lamoille, Orange, Rutland, Washington, Windham, and Windsor counties had previously been approved.Some additional updates that were shared during the town meeting by FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) for Vermont Will Roy, District Director of the Small Business Administration (SBA) Darcy Carter, State Director of USDA-Rural Development Sarah Waring, and State Executive Director of USDA-Farm Service Agency (FSA) John Roberts, include, to date at the time of the town meeting:

The Congressional Delegation also spoke about legislation they are expecting to come before Congress to address many of the gaps in federal disaster relief, as well as the work they’re doing to ensureinsurance companiesin the state treat impacted Vermonters fairly.Nearly 200 questions were sent in ahead of the town meeting and hundreds more were submitted during the call itself. While all questions will receive follow ups from Senator Sanders’ office, questions taken live reflected common themes, including: recovery assistance for renters, business owners, employees, farmers, homeowners and local governments. Callers asked how to account for lost days of work, how to file claims with FEMA and insurance companies; as well as what resources are available for rebuilding roads and bridges, for addressing the trauma and mental health needs of impacted Vermonters, for cleaning out damage, and for financial support for farms and small businesses to enable them to reopen. Callers who went live during the town meeting were from some of the most impacted towns across Vermont, including Johnson, Londonderry, Barre, Berlin, and many more. And while many questions focused on specific needs, many callers recognized the need for investments in building back in a way that will be more resilient and urged the government officials to keep fighting for policies to address the existential threat of climate change.“I don’t have to explain to anyone who has been impacted by the flooding as to what that means,”said Sen. Sanders.“It has disrupted people’s lives – driven them out of their homes and businesses and run up huge bills which many people simply cannot afford. Pure and simple: This has been a disaster for thousands of Vermonters. Let me just thank everybody who got on the line for this town meeting – the Vermonters who have asked the questions, the Governor, Sen. Welch, Congresswoman Balint, and all the folks at the federal and state agencies. Bottom line here is that we are going to have to all stick together, work together, and get out of this crisis as best we can and as soon as we can.”Said Governor Scott:“I appreciate Senator Sanders for putting the call together. My team and I will continue to work closely with him, Senator Welch and Congresswoman Balint as we transition to the recovery phase of our response. We have a long road ahead, but I’m confident that working together, we will get through this and build back better than before. We are Vermont strong, and tough too.”“It’s been incredibly inspiring to see how Vermonters have come to the aid of other Vermonters,”said Sen. Welch.“But at the end of the day, there’s a reality that folks face about their homes, about their businesses, about their farms. Can they hang on and keep going? Our job — all of us, the Governor, and the Congressional delegation — is to do everything that we possibly can to get you to the other side and to come out of this. We’re going to work together to do just that and to get you the support you need. I encourage everyone to document their losses and report damages to 2-1-1 so we can better understand your needs, and I’m grateful to Sen. Sanders, Gov. Scott, Rep. Balint, and our federal partners for coming together for this important event.”Rep. Balint said:“Collaboration between federal and state government when our state is in need is so critical to get our communities to the other side of recovery. Thank you to Senators Sanders and Welch, Governor Scott, and the State officials for coming together to keep Vermonters up to date and informed. We will get through this together and the delegation will work tirelessly to make sure no Vermonters fall through the cracks as we rebuild.”For flood resources, please see below:

Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 27 – Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday issued a joint statement signaling a commitment from both Finance and HELP to partner and work towards legislation aimed at addressing primary care and other health care workforce shortages across the country:“In our country today, tens of millions of Americans are unable to access the primary care, dental care, maternity care, long-term services and supports, and behavioral health care that they desperately need, in large part because of massive shortages of health care workers. Addressing health care workforce shortages across the country is going to require fresh, big-league ideas that leave no stone unturned. The HELP and Finance Committees are responsible for federal health care policy that touches every part of the country, and we are confident that together our committees can find solutions to pass the Senate that ensure health care providers are able to give communities and patients the care they need and expect.“On September 30th, mandatory funding for community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers is set to expire. These programs are vital to supporting a robust health care workforce in the United States and should be substantially expanded to meet today’s challenges.“It is estimated that our country faces a shortage of more than 120,000 doctors – including an acute shortage of primary care doctors. We cannot grow the number of doctors in America without addressing the reality that thousands of applicants for a residency position don’t match with a residency program due to a lack of funding. It is vitally important that we expand funding for the GME program – and dedicate a substantial portion of those slots to primary care and psychiatry residents where the greatest shortages of physicians exist.“In addition to building up the physician workforce through GME programs, we are also focused on incentivizing health care providers to partner with schools to train and develop health care professionals, from medical assistants to advanced practice nurses. We will also continue to prioritize expanding the number of behavioral health providers, improving access to maternal health providers in rural areas, and investing in the direct care workforce to ensure the health and safety of older Americans and people with disabilities.“Virtually every major medical organization in America understands that an investment in building the health care workforce is crucial to ensuring the health of all Americans. They understand that focusing on these shortages will enable disease prevention and provide Americans with medical care that will not only save lives, but will save money. This effort is going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to get across the finish line.“As the Chairs of the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee, we are committed to working with our committee members on legislation to bring forward in the fall to significantly expand primary care and the health care workforce in America.”

Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 25 – The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Thursday, July 27 will hold a markup of critical bipartisan legislation to expand high-quality economic opportunities for workers across the country through apprenticeships and other workforce development programs.

Currently, there are nearly 27,000 registered apprenticeship programs in the United States serving more than 600,000 apprentices. This package of legislation would create up to 1 million new earn-as-you-learn opportunities that help apprentices receive a nationally recognized portable credential and gain workplace-relevant skills and mentorship in the field of their choice. Apprentices have a 93 percent employment retention rate and average a $300,000 lifetime earning advantage over other workers. They also often take on marginal if any debt, as most training costs are covered by an employer or union, while 65 percent of students graduating with a bachelor’s degree have student loan debt averaging $34,100.

In particular, this package would expand high-quality apprenticeship programs for young people, allowing them to begin programs while they are in high school. American apprentices are, on average, 29 years old – much older than other countries like Germany and Austria where most apprentices begin at age 16.

The four bills that the committee will be voting on are:

Title: In Letter to Secretary Buttigieg, Vermont Congressional Delegation Urges U.S. Department of Transportation to Activate Emergency Funds for Vermont Flood Recovery Efforts
Date: July 24, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, VT— Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Peter Welch (D-VT) and Representative Becca Balint (VT-AL) sent a letter to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this past Friday, calling on the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support the State of Vermont’s request for immediate and robust assistance to help Vermont rebuild and recover from the recent devastating flooding. The congressional delegation urged Secretary Buttigieg to activate aid through DOT’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Emergency Relief (ER) program to help fund repairs and improvements to roads, bridges, culverts, and other impacted infrastructure across the state, including the 93-mile Lamoille Valley Rail Trail.“We are grateful for the show of support provided by your Department and the rest of the Biden Administration and urge a speedy approval of flexible FHWA ER funds requested by Vermont — so that the state and individuals impacted by the floods can begin to rebuild,” the letter read. “We are confident that, with your support, Vermonters will come through this stronger and more resilient.”Funding from the Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief program can support repairs to roads and other federal-aid infrastructure damaged during natural disasters. In Vermont, where roads, bridges, and trails remain closed across the state due to damage from recent flooding, landslides, and mudslides, funds would provide essential support for the state’s recovery efforts. The program also supports improvements to protective features that will minimize future damage from natural disasters, improve resilience to climate change, and ensure greater reliability of local infrastructure in the future. The letter also asked DOT to allow a longer timeline to grant Vermont 100% federal reimbursement for project costs under the FHWA ER program than the current 270-day period, given that the state cannot undergo construction in the winter season.Said Governor Phil Scott: “The damages to the State Highway system from the July storms are substantial. Financial assistance from the Federal Highway Administration through the Emergency Relief Program is essential to ensure we’re able to rebuild our highway network stronger and more resilient. I appreciate the continued support from the Department of Transportation, Secretary Buttigieg, and the hard work of our congressional delegation on behalf of Vermonters.”

Secretary Buttigieg traveled to Vermont to survey flood damage on July 17.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Balint Call On Federally-Backed and Private Insurers to Act Quickly and Fairly During Vermont Flood Recovery
Date: July 24, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., July 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) today sent letters to 95 insurance companies holding federally-backed and private insurance policies across Vermont – including the top flood, homeowner, and auto insurance companies – calling on them to act quickly and fairly when assessing what damage from the recent floods can be covered under their individual policies. While most individuals and small businesses in Vermont have no flood insurance, the vast majority of those who do are covered through the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). NFIP is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with policies operated by private insurance companies.In the letters, the congressional delegation called on these companies to take specific and critical steps to help insured Vermonters get back on their feet, including temporarily suspending premium payments, promptly processing all claims, providing advanced payments when possible, and properly investigating all claims to determine if coverage exists. They also asked them to respond to the delegation no later than July 31, 2023, to confirm whether their respective companies are taking these steps and to detail any additional actions they have planned to help impacted Vermonters recover from this crisis.“It is imperative that impacted Vermonters know how to best avoid incorrect insurance claim denials,” Sanders, Welch, and Balint wrote in the letters. “To achieve this, we are counting on your company to take the steps outlined below to ensure that Vermonters receive all the help to which they are entitled to rebuild their lives following this catastrophic flooding. This is the time for showing compassion and flexibility for working families and small business owners so that disaster survivors in Vermont can get back on their feet as quickly as possible. As an insurance provider, you play an important role in this recovery process, and your actions today will decide the state’s trajectory for years to come.”Sanders, Welch, and Balint concluded the letters by making clear to the insurance companies that each of their offices are in continuous and direct contact with impacted Vermonters, and that the delegation will be notifying the Department of Financial Regulation of any problems that arise, as well as following up directly with the insurers to address them.Sanders, Welch, and Balint wrote: “We are closely tracking incoming correspondence from Vermonters regarding their insurance claims and payments by company, insurance type, and monitoring specific issues that constituents are experiencing. Should we notice any problematic patterns, we will be notifying the Department of Financial Regulation, as well as contacting your company directly to talk through possible solutions. Thank you in advance for doing the right thing by those Vermont families and businesses you insure as they, and our state, recovers from catastrophic flooding.”Read the full letter,here.

WASHINGTON, July 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Thursday issued the following statement after the committeefavorably reported outthe Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Response Act:“Over 1 million Americans died from COVID. In fact, we lost more Americans as a result of COVID than we did in World War II. In my view, virtually every public health official in America tried their best, but it would be an understatement to say that we were tragically unprepared to respond to this crisis.“Common sense dictates that we have got to do a much better job to either prevent or be much better prepared for the next pandemic. That is a major part of what this legislation does. This legislation will help us make sure that we have a capable workforce in place – not just nurses and doctors, but also public health workers, our ‘disease detectives’ – who can figure out where an outbreak is happening and set up vaccination clinics among many other things. This legislation will help make sure that we have accurate public health data to know who is getting sick. This legislation will help make sure that we have enough medical supplies for our health care workers.“The legislation that we passed today will not only help us in our efforts to prepare and respond to the next pandemic, it will also help us respond to natural disasters as well as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. We will improve data collection for infectious diseases and monitor new pathogens through wastewater surveillance. Under this bill, we will require drug manufacturers to report more information to the FDA about drug shortages so that the federal government can take action more quickly to respond to these shortages. This legislation will require drug manufacturers to notify FDA if there is an increase in demand that they will not be able to meet – like we saw with children’s Tylenol this winter. This legislation also directs HHS to work with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to study prizes – a transformative new way of paying for the development of prescription drugs. This study will take a serious look at how we can create new treatments and cures, without the burdens of monopolies and high prices.“I want to thank Sen. Casey and Sen. Romney, as well as Ranking Member Cassidy, for working closely together to move this legislation forward.”

The senators strongly affirmed their support for workers exercising their right to strike if an equitable collective bargaining agreement cannot be reached, and committed to not intervening in the collective bargaining process between Teamsters and UPS.

“We understand that UPS Teamsters recently announced their overwhelming authorization of a strike—which would be the largest work stoppage at a single employer in American history—if the two parties cannot reach agreement on a contract by August 1,” wrote the senators. “We are hopeful that both sides can negotiate in good faith and reach a consensus agreement that addresses basic human needs and allows workers to do their jobs safely and with dignity. However, in the event a fair and equitable collective bargaining agreement cannot be reached, we commit to respect our constituents’ statutory and constitutional rights to withhold their labor and initiate and participate in a strike.”

The Teamsters-UPS contract is the largest private collective bargaining agreement in North America, covering nearly 350,000 workers. UPS Teamsters play an essential role every day in delivering necessary products across the country, including food and medicine, and play a critical role in keeping the American economy afloat. UPS made more than $11 billion in profits in 2022 and could afford to return $8.6 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.

WASHINGTON, July 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Wednesday issued the following statement after he introduced major legislation to overhaul the primary health care system in America:

“As every American knows, our country faces a major crisis in primary care and a massive shortage of doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, and dentists. Tens of millions of Americans live in communities where they cannot find a doctor while others have to wait months to be seen. At the end of the day, this crisis not only increases human suffering and unnecessary deaths, but wastes tens of billions a year as Americans flock to expensive ER rooms or hospitals because they could not access the primary care they need. The HELP Committee is in a unique position to address these long-standing issues, and that is precisely what we will do on July 26th.

“The legislation being introduced today will invest $20 billion a year over a five-year period to expand community health centers and provide the resources necessary to recruit, train, and retain tens of thousands of primary care doctors, mental health providers, nurses, dentists, and home health care workers. It will be paid for by cutting a fraction of the enormous waste and abuse in our health care system and reduce what Americans pay for some of the most expensive prescription drugs on the market.

“Every major medical organization agrees that our investment in primary health care is woefully inadequate as we invest less than half of what other major countries spend on primary health care. They understand that investing in disease prevention and providing Americans with a medical home will not only save lives, it will save money.

“I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on the HELP Committee to pass a bipartisan primary care bill on July 26th.”

Themarkupof the legislation will occur at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 26, 2023 in the HELP Committee.

Tess Stack Kuenning, President and CEO of Bi-State Primary Care Association, said in a statement: “We applaud Senator Sanders for his vision to expand and deepen essential workforce initiatives and comprehensive team based primary care including medical, dental, and oral health services provided through Community Health Centers across our nation. Senator Sanders proposes to greatly expand the number of doctors, dentists, nurse practitioners, and nurses, as well as expanding loan repayment and teaching health center opportunities to begin to fill our nations primary care gap. At this time, our nation’s health care system is under significant stress, and these resources will begin to alleviate and meet the need. We extend our sincere gratitude to Senator Sanders for this proposal.”

Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of Advocates for Community Health (ACH), said about the bill: “We are deeply grateful for Senator Sanders’ continued commitment to making a bold investment in community health centers. Support of these hyper-local health care hubs has historically been bipartisan, and we are eager to see champions on both sides of the aisle come together to ensure health centers can fulfill their mission to bring critical, comprehensive care to underserved communities nationwide. This funding would enable vital support and pathways to expand a severely strained health care workforce in rural and underserved communities. It also positions 1,400 community health centers across the country to not only navigate the unprecedented challenges they currently face, but also bolster resources to provide care to millions who lack access in addition to the more than the 30 million patients they currently serve each year. Health centers are a proven solution to the health inequities in our nation, and we stand ready to work with leaders in Congress to design a bipartisan agreement that will empower the community health center program for years to come.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Once Again Urges Biden Administration to Act to Lower Outrageous Price of Alzheimer’s Treatment and Costly New Prescription Drugs
Date: July 10, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 10 – Following the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) full approval of the Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, on Monday sent a follow-upletterto U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra once again urging the Biden Administration to act to substantially reduce the price of this treatment and to develop a plan to lower the price of all new prescription drugs. Sanders previouslywroteto Becerra last month on the outrageous cost of Leqembi before the FDA’s approval.

“Alzheimer’s is a horrible disease,” Sanders wrote. “We must do everything possible to find a cure for the millions of people who suffer from it today, and the millions more who will be afflicted in the coming years. But, as we grapple with the huge number of Americans who will be seeking medical treatment for Alzheimer’s, we must develop policies now that prevent pharmaceutical companies from bankrupting Medicare and our entire health care system.”

In his letter, Sanders asked Secretary Becerra why the price of Leqembi could not be lowered to $8,900, which is the price independent experts believe it should cost based on its effectiveness. Sanders also asked Secretary Becerra how much Leqembi will cost Medicare, how much Medicare premiums will go up for all seniors as a result of the cost of this one drug, how many seniors with Alzheimer’s will not be able to receive treatment because they cannot afford to pay the more than $5,000 co-payment for Leqembi, and what strategy, if any, HHS is developing to lower the price of new prescription drugs coming onto the market.

Sanders requested that Secretary Becerra provide a written response to his questions no later than July 21. If Sanders does not receive a timely and adequate response to these questions, he will be inviting Secretary Becerra to attend a HELP Committee hearing to “explain to the American people why we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and how those outrageous prices threaten Medicare beneficiaries and patients throughout the country.”

Leqembi was developed by Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and Biogen, an American company that in 2021 wanted to charge U.S. taxpayers $56,000 for a different Alzheimer’s treatment called Aduhelm. After public pressure from Sanders, Biogen backed down and lowered the price to $28,200. Biogen and Eisai have set the price of Leqembi at $26,500 even though the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent non-profit organization, estimated in March that this drug should be sold for as little as $8,900 per year based on its effectiveness.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, if only 10 percent of the 6.7 million older adults with Alzheimer’s disease take Leqembi at Eisai and Biogen’s proposed price, it would cost Medicare $17.8 billion, which is nearly half of what Medicare Part B spent on all drugs in 2021.

In early December of 2021, Sanderssenta letter to President Biden urging him to instruct Medicare to delay expanding coverage of Aduhelm until the scientific community determined that it was safe and effective and to reverse a record-breaking increase in Medicare premiums attributable to the $56,000 price of this drug. Sanders first spoke out about Biogen’s outrageous greed when the original $56,000 price tag for the treatment was released. As a result, the Administration limited access to Aduhelm for clinical trials and reduced Medicare premiums by 3 percent this year.

BURLINGTON, Vt., July 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today issued the following statement on the extreme flooding hitting Vermont.

“In the midst of the terrible flooding we are seeing, I want to thank all the emergency crews who have been working tirelessly to protect the lives and property of Vermonters during this very difficult time. I also want to thank the federal crews who are on their way from around our region and as far away as North Carolina.

“We continue to see dangerous and life-threatening rain and flooding across sections of our state, causing significant damage to homes, public buildings, dams, and roads. It is imperative that Vermonters stay safe as the flash flood risk continues through today and a flood watch remains in effect until 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday. Vermonters should monitor media reports, follow instructions fromVermont Emergency Management, never attempt to walk or drive through flood waters, and familiarize yourself with your best flood evacuation routes.

“Today, and in the coming weeks and months, my office will be working hard with state and federal agencies to make sure that Vermont gets all the support it will need from the federal government.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Supreme Court Overturning Student Debt Cancellation
Date: June 30, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., June 30 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, issued the following statement Friday after the right-wing majority of the U.S. Supreme Court moved to block President Biden’s action to cancel student debt for 40 million Americans:Today’s 6-3 Supreme Court decision is a devastating blow for tens of millions of low-income and working class Americans who were hoping for relief from the severe financial stress they face due to a mountain of student debt.Thirteen years ago, in the disastrous Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court ruled that billionaires can legally buy elections. Today, the Supreme Court has made it clear that they will continue doing everything possible to protect the big money interests against the needs of struggling working families. This right wing ideology is consistent with their recent decisions: denying women the right to control their own bodies, ending affirmative action, attacking LGBT rights and limiting the government’s ability to address climate change.Justice Kagan is absolutely correct when she wrote in her dissenting opinion that “this case should have been open-and-shut” in favor of the Biden Administration, the “Court’s first overreach in this case is deciding it at all,” and that the Supreme Court should “stay away from making this Nation’s policy about subjects like student-loan relief.”In my view, if right-wing Supreme Court justices want to make public policy they should quit the Supreme Court and run for political office. Frankly, I do not think their extremist views will gain much traction with the average American voter.Today, I am urging the Biden Administration to implement a Plan B immediately to cancel student debt for tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay the rent, put food on the table, and pay for the basic necessities of life.Despite this legally unsound Supreme Court decision, the President has the clear authority under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cancel student debt. He must use this authority immediately.If Republicans could provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and profitable corporations, if they could cancel hundreds of billions in loans for wealthy business owners during the pandemic when Trump was President and if they could vote to spend $886 billion on the Pentagon, please don’t tell me that we cannot afford to cancel student debt for working families.The American people understand that we cannot continue to crush our young generation with a mountain of debt for doing the right thing – getting a college education.As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I will do everything I can to make sure that the more than 40 million Americans who are drowning in student debt get the relief that was promised to them as soon as possible.Lastly, the time is long overdue for the Supreme Court to do what every other branch of the judiciary does. They must establish a code of ethical standards so that justices cannot secretly accept lavish financial gifts from billionaire patrons.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Sen. Sanders, Sen. Welch, and Rep. Balint to Hold Town Meeting on Youth Mental Health Crisis
Date: June 27, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., June 27 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, with Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.), will hold a town meeting on the youth mental health crisis on Thursday, June 29.

Together, the Vermont Congressional Delegation will give an update on the actions being taken at the federal level to combat the mental health crisis, and will hear from young people, parents, educators, physicians, mental health professionals, and community members about the challenges young people are facing. This community conversation will focus on how we can work together to address the needs of young people and the needs of their families.

In 2021, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Children’s Hospital Association – which collectively represent more than 77,000 physicians and more than 200 children’s hospitals – joined together to declare a “national emergency” in the mental health of children and young people in the United States. The effects of that crisis is also being felt in Vermont. According torecently releaseddata from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 35 percent of high schoolers and about 20 percent of middle schoolers in Vermont during 2021 reported experiencing poor mental health “most of the time, or always.”

Today, suicide is one of the leading causes of death for young people in the U.S. and estimates show more than 60 percent of children who are struggling with depression do not get any mental health care. Meanwhile, as record numbers of young people are in need of mental health care, some 158 million Americans – nearly half the country’s population – live in a mental health care desert and about 80 percent of the country faces a severe shortage of child psychiatrists.

Earlier this month, as Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, Sanders held ahearing on the youth mental health crisis. In the past year, Sanders also held alivestream discussionwith U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy on youth mental health and has met with more than 5,000 Vermont students both virtually and in-person through town meetings and roundtable discussions. In April, Balint introduced thePeer Education and Emergency Response for Mental Health Actto establish a grant program that supports training for teachers, school personnel, parents, caregivers, and students in mental health first aid. In May, Balint introduced theProtecting Young Minds Online Actand Welch reintroduced theDigital Platform Commission Act. Both bills look to address the effects of new technology and social media on consumers.

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders Opens Sweeping Investigation into Amazon Warehouse Safety and Calls for Amazon Workers to Share Their Stories
Date: June 20, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 20 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), sent alettertoday to Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy initiating a HELP Committee investigation into the abysmal safety record in Amazon’s warehouses and the company’s treatment of workers who are injured in those warehouses. Sanders also published awebsitewhere Amazon workers can submit stories about their experiences at the company to help inform the Committee’s investigation.In the letter, Sanders wrote, “The company’s quest for profits at all costs has led to unsafe physical environments, intense pressure to work at unsustainable rates, and inadequate medical attention for tens of thousands of Amazon workers every year.”“Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world worth $1.3 trillion and its founder, Jeff Bezos, is one of the richest men in the world worth nearly $150 billion,” Sanders wrote. “Amazon should be one of the safest places in America to work, not one of the most dangerous. If Amazon can afford to spend $6 billion on stock buybacks last year, it can afford to make sure that its warehouses are safe places to work. If Amazon can afford to pay you $289 million in total compensation over the past two years, it can afford to treat all of its workers with dignity and respect, not contempt. The time has come for Amazon to stop willfully violating workplace safety laws with impunity and commit to changing its operations to protect the health and safety of its workers.”Sanders emphasized that the immense wealth amassed by the company and its executives is directly tied to the decisions to force workers into these unsafe environments, writing, “In its endless pursuit of profits, Amazon sacrifices workers’ bodies under the constant pressure of a surveillance system that enforces impossible rates. When faced with worker injuries, Amazon provides minimal medical care… This system forces workers to endure immeasurable long-term pain and disabilities while Amazon makes incredible profits from their labor.” Those decisions also contribute to the company’s turnover rate, which has regularly been as high as 150 percent per year.Congress cannot allow this to continue. Sanders is demanding that Amazon provide information about the high injury and turnover rates at Amazon’s warehouses, the connection between the extremely fast pace of work demanded of Amazon’s workers and these injury rates, and the inadequate medical care provided at Amazon’s on-site medical clinics.Amazon’s warehouses remain uniquely unsafe even as regulators have repeatedly cited the company for violations of federal workplace safety laws. The company’s employees suffered more serious injuries than all of the other warehouse workers in the country combined in 2022, despite Amazon only employing approximately a third of the country’s warehouse workers. Amazon’s serious injury rate is double the warehousing industry’s average. The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and state regulators have provided Amazon with measures it could adopt to comply with workplace safety laws and make its warehouses safer. Amazon has chosen to disregard the vast majority of those recommendations.When Amazon workers are inevitably injured, the letter notes, the company has a documented history of failing to provide adequate medical care. Instead, significant reporting indicates that the company’s on-site medical clinics under-treat and underreport injuries in an effort to push workers back onto the warehouse floor as quickly as possible and downplay the number of serious injuries employees suffer.Sanders is also asking Amazon workers to submit stories about their time at the company through a webpage availableHERE. The submissions are confidential and will help the HELP Committee investigate how the company fails to protect workers and evades responsibility for their necessary medical care.Read the full letter,here.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the chairman of the HELP Committee, will be on the floor of the Senate Tuesday afternoon to discuss this legislation in detail.The three bills that the Committee will be voting on are:The Paycheck Fairness Act would end the absurdity of women earning substantially less than men for doing the same work. This legislation would make it easier for women to come together, file, and win lawsuits against unscrupulous employers who commit wage discrimination.The Healthy Families Act which would end, once and for all, the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid sick days to workers. This legislation would guarantee that every worker in America receive up to seven paid sick days by their employers.The PRO Act would make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions and successfully secure a first union contract.

Washington, D.C–Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) issued the following statement condemning the targetedincidentat LGBTQI+ poetry event at Lyndonville Library earlier this week:

“Hate should have no place in Vermont. It’s disturbing to see homophobia and racism loud and present here in Vermont. Extremism and hate must be answered. We cannot allow it to take root in darkness or hope it will disappear if we ignore it. We affirm, loudly and with pride, our commitment to an equitable, welcoming, inclusive Vermont.

“As this incident sadly reminds us, Vermont is not immune from the challenges of our time. But we have also seen and lived the best of Vermont, one that is welcoming and courageous. In a healthy democracy we should embrace diversity, not protest it, and try to shut it down. That is the Vermont we must all continue to strive for, with courage, kindness, and an unceasing belief in community.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Brownley, and 11 Senators Introduce Legislation to Establish Dental Care Pilot Program for Veterans with Chronic Health Conditions
Date: June 14, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 14 – In a continued effort to expand and strengthen access to dental care for veterans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) joined with Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.) to introduce legislation yesterday that would establish a new pilot program to provide comprehensive dental care to veterans diagnosed with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Funded for four years, the program would also study the health outcomes and cost effectiveness of such care, as well as provide loan reimbursement opportunities for qualified dental care professionals who agree to serve for the duration of the pilot at a VA dental clinic deemed high need.Joining Sanders and Brownley on the Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act are Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).“The goal of this legislation is really pretty simple: To improve and expand access to dental care for veterans throughout the country,”said Sen. Sanders, who is a longtime member and former chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.“Today, millions of veterans have access to timely, high-quality health care through the VA. However, very few of these veterans have access to dental care through the VA and many also struggle with chronic health conditions made worse by that lack of dental care. To my mind, this doesn’t make sense. The evidence is very clear that a person’s oral health is directly linked to a person’s general health. This pilot program would be an important step toward delivering essential dental care to veterans who really need it, so that no veteran is left behind.”“Poor dental care is directly associated with poorer overall health,”said Congresswoman Brownley.“We simply cannot address veterans’ whole health without also addressing the critical and dire need for dental care. I am proud to author the House companion to Senator Sanders’ bill, and I look forward to working with him and our colleagues on the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees to expand dental coverage to more veterans.”Study after study shows that poor dental hygiene is directly linked to other chronic health care conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. According to theAmerican Diabetes Association, diabetes triples the risk of getting periodontal disease, a severe gum infection that can lead to tooth loss, bone loss, and other serious health complications. An individual withdiabetes and periodontal diseaseis also three times more likely to develop cardiorenal mortality, a fatal combination of ischemic heart disease and diabetic nephropathy. Anotherstudyhas found that people with periodontitis, or gum disease, have a greater risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke.However, out of the 9.2 million veterans enrolled in VA health care, only 1.4 million are eligible for comprehensive dental care. According to the VA, in 2020, more than 3 million veterans with diabetes and heart disease went without access to affordable, comprehensive dental care, increasing their exposure to the fatal risks associated with these chronic health conditions.Studies estimate that if 50 percent of veterans are treated for gum disease, over six billion dollars would be saved annually in heart disease and diabetes treatments. In 2020, the VA spent an average of $86,000 per veteran per year on health care for veterans with heart disease, while it spent an average of $11,000 on veterans with diabetes. Compare that with the $1,132 it costs the VA annually to provide a veteran with comprehensive dental care. Additionally, the VA has spent over $124 million in the past four years on emergency room care for veterans with oral health problems who do not have access to affordable dental care. According to theAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, of the 2 million Americans who visited the Emergency Room in 2018 for dental emergencies, 1.9 million could have been treated by a dentist, reducing associated ER expenses by 78 percent.The Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act is endorsed by American Institute of Dental Public Health (AIDPH), American Dental Hygienists’ Association, American Heart Association, Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors, Care in Action , CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, Common Defense, Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Minority Veterans of America (MVA), National Domestic Workers Alliance, Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), National Council on Aging, Public Citizen, Save our VA (SOVA), SMART Recovery, Social Security Works, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW).“Denying dental care to veterans most vulnerable to dental problems makes no sense. This legislation would guarantee such care to veterans with diabetes and heart disease – chronic conditions that put them most at-risk,”said Sen. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.“Expanding care means investing in our veterans’ health and wellbeing. I’m proud to join my colleagues in this legislation.”“Many of America’s veterans are unable to access dental care due to current VA eligibility restrictions,”said Sen. Booker.“Dental care is important to our overall health and well-being. I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation to establish a pilot program that would work towards providing comprehensive dental care to veterans. We owe it to our veterans, who risked their lives in service of our nation, to ensure they have the comprehensive care they deserve.”“Our veterans honorably served our country, and they deserve quality, accessible health care after their service,”said Sen. Durbin.“The VA has provided this care for decades, but not many veterans are eligible for dental care despite studies that link poor dental health to other chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. I’m signing on to the Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act to research and study the health care outcomes of offering comprehensive dental care to veterans with these conditions. My hope is that this legislation will be a steppingstone to making dental care accessible for all veterans using the VA’s health care system.”“Our veterans have laid their lives on the line for our country, but too often they are left behind despite their sacrifices,”said Sen. Fetterman.“Pennsylvania is home to one of the nation’s highest population of veterans, yet many Pennsylvania veterans cannot get dental care coverage through the VA. Our veterans and their families deserve the best health care this country can offer. This bill to expand dental care eligibility and provide the VA with the resources it needs will help serve our veterans wherever they are, regardless of their zip code.”“Access to high-quality dental care is integral to one’s overall physical health and should be part of the whole spectrum of care we offer our veterans,”said Sen. Menendez.“I have long-championed expanding health care for our veterans and this pilot program will ensure that dental care is part of comprehensive health care at the VA.”“We cannot fully address veterans’ health care by leaving out dental services – Congress must ensure the VA has the resources necessary to reach all of our veterans no matter the services they require,”said Sen. Merkley.“This bill is a critical step in ensuring the VA can recruit top flight dental professionals so our veterans have the accessible and quality health care services that they have earned.”“We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude and support after they return home, and that includes ensuring they have access to a full range of health care benefits,” saidSen. Whitehouse.“Our legislation will launch a pilot program to provide comprehensive dental care to veterans and better support the overall health of those who served.”“Quality comprehensive dental care to veterans in Oregon and nationwide is a crucial and earned benefit,”Sen. Wyden said.“Any good dentist will tell you that poor dental hygiene can lead to diabetes and heart disease, which is why access to quality affordable care is critical. I’ll always fight tooth and nail to get veterans the care they deserve.”Annaliese Cothron, co-founder and executive director for the American Institute of Dental Public Health:“Veterans deserve equitable oral health. Our data and research are very compelling: For every dollar invested in expanding dental care, the VA could be saving one dollar on diabetes management and two dollars on heart disease management. An expansion for high-risk, high-cost veterans would not only save taxpayer dollars but save veterans the inescapable pain that comes with chronic poor oral health. We commend Senator Sanders’ focus on fiscally viable policy solutions that ensure veterans have their dental needs met.”“Poor dental hygiene is linked to many ailments afflicting disabled veterans,”DAV National Commander Joe Parsetich said.“But with the VA providing dental services to only a fraction of those they serve, far too many are left to search for such care on their own, or worse, not look at all. The Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act would take a big step in the right direction by temporarily expanding dental care to veterans suffering from heart disease and diabetes. We thank Sen. Sanders for his leadership in introducing this necessary legislation.”AMVETS National Commander Don McLean said:“AMVETS believes in granting our veterans additional opportunities to access treatments and care that could prevent more severe conditions from manifesting. We support the Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act that will provide dental care for veterans with certain conditions that could be made worse by lack of access to this resource.”“As a grassroots organization, Common Defense and our members strongly support the Improving Whole Health for Veterans with Chronic Conditions Act,”said Naveed A. Shah, Political Director at Common Defense.“Expanding access to dental care for veterans who are suffering from diseases which amplify the risk of potentially fatal complications is a commonsense measure. Not only does this fit with the VA’s Whole Health mission, but also will help to reduce health care costs overall, and save lives. We applaud Senators Sanders, Whitehouse, Welch, Merkley, Wyden, Blumenthal, Booker, and Fetterman for bringing this important legislation forward. We hope Congress will take it up swiftly.”“The need for dental care to lessen the complications of diabetes and cardiovascular heart disease is obvious to experienced health care providers,”said Dr. James Martin, National Representative of the American Federation of Government Employees and National VA Council.“This bill gives the VA the opportunity to demonstrate that providing dental care to veterans, will improve their overall health and well-being, lessen their risk of complications from cardiovascular heart disease and diabetes, and accomplish this at impressive cost savings. These savings will be apparent when historical costs and outcomes of those who did not have dental benefits are compared with those who will have dental benefits.”Read the bill summary,here.Read the section-by-section,here.Read the bill text,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Booker Introduce Legislation to Close Eligibility Gaps in Health Care Access for Millions of Veterans, the National Guard, and Reserve Service Members
Date: June 14, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and current Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, along with his colleagues in the Senate, yesterday introduced two pieces of legislation that would close eligibility gaps to ensure millions more veterans regardless of income, as well as the National Guard and Reserve service members, can access health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) joined Sanders on the Department of Veterans Affairs Income Eligibility Standardization Act, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Welch joined Sanders on the National Guard Health Care Access and Expansion Act.“As a longtime member and former Chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have seen up close the pain, death, and despair caused by war and its aftermath,”said Sanders.“Honoring the extraordinary sacrifice and bravery of our veterans, Guard and Reserve service members is one of the most important commitments we have as a country. It’s time to stop making veterans jump through bureaucratic hoops to get the health care and benefits they have earned and were promised. These two pieces of legislation will go a long way in cutting through the red tape so that millions more veterans, National Guard and Reserve service members, and their families receive the best and most comprehensive health care our country can provide.”“The cost of the war must include the cost of caring for the warrior. Too often that’s not the case, and veterans and National Guard and Reserve service members struggle to access the benefits they’ve earned and deserve,”said Welch.“This legislation will help service members and veterans cut through red tape and secure the support they need. I’m proud to join Senators Sanders and Booker to support these essential bills.”“Many of America’s veterans are unable to access health care due to eligibility gaps that entangles them in bureaucratic red tape,”said Booker.“This barrier to services is unjustifiable, and it goes against one of our most sacred responsibilities as a nation: providing accessible and quality health care for our veterans. We owe it to our veterans, who risked their lives in service of our nation, to ensure they receive the comprehensive care they deserve.”Currently, 4.7 million veterans across the U.S. cannot access health care through the VA because of inconsistent enrollment policies for a category titled Priority Group 8 – a grouping currently determined by whether the veteran’s gross household income is above the VA national income threshold of $43,834. The Veterans Affairs Income Eligibility Standardization Act simplifies the unnecessary complexity of Priority Group 8 to ensure that the millions of veterans who fall into this grouping are not denied access to quality, affordable health care through the VA.Regarding the National Guard Health Care Access and Expansion Act, in recent years, the National Guard and Reserve service members have experienced the highest number of activations since World War II. However, under current law, members of the National Guard and the Reserves are not allowed to access health care through the VA, and many members of the Guard and Reserve have no health insurance when not active under federal orders. In 2019, approximately 60,000 members of the National Guard, 14 percent of the force, reported having no medical or hospitalization insurance – many due to cost.For example, a drilling E-4 earns roughly $351 per month in basic pay, while TRICARE Reserve Select premiums cost $46.70 a month for an individual or $229.99 monthly for family coverage, plus copays/coinsurance. Additionally, Guard and Reserve members are only eligible for TRICARE Prime – which provides them and their families with no-cost health care – if they serve on federal orders for more than 30 days.With the expanding scope of their missions, a significant increase in activations, and the need to recruit and retain a talented, skilled, and ready workforce, the National Guard Health Care Access and Expansion Act will ensure that members of the National Guard and Reserve have the health care needed to maintain force readiness by allowing them to access VA health care when not on active orders.In public testimony given to Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Defense on June 1, 2023,Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, said: “As I begin my final year as chief, there are still many things we must accomplish to ensure the National Guard remains always ready…There are many things we can surge in times of emergency, but medical readiness is not one of them. Access to care is critical to medical readiness and the number one concern I hear from our guardsmen and recruiters when I visit our states and territories. To help recruit and retain the most talented skilled and ready force, all National Guard service members regardless of status need medical coverage. This is a matter of readiness, a matter of duty to the guardsmen who serve and sacrifice for our nation.”The National Guard Health Care Access and Expansion Act is endorsed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Business Leaders for Health Care Transformation, Center for Health & Democracy, Center for Popular Democracy, Coalition of Veteran Organizations, Common Defense, For All, Health Care Voices, Honor the Earth, Hunger Free America, National Rural Health Association, Save our VA (SOVA), SMART Recovery, and Sojourners.AMVETS National Commander Don McLean said:“AMVETS strongly supports the National Guard Health Care Access and Expansion Act, which will provide specialized health care resources to members of the National Guard and Reserve. Whether on active orders or not, these men and women require consistent access to health care to remain ready to defend our country.”The Department of Veterans Affairs Income Eligibility Standardization Act is endorsed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Business Leaders for Health Care Transformation, Center for Health & Democracy, Center for Popular Democracy, Coalition of Veteran Organizations, Common Defense, Disabled American Veterans (DAV), For All, Health Care Voices, Honor the Earth, Hunger Free America, Justice in Aging, Save our VA (SOVA), SMART Recovery, Sojourners, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW).“Because AMVETS strongly supports access to health care for all veterans, regardless of background or income, we are proud to support the Department of Veterans Affairs Income Eligibility Standardization Act,”continued Commander Don McLean.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces $1 Million in Federal Funding for Solar and Other Sustainable Energy Projects in Vermont Schools, Libraries and More
Date: June 9, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., June 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the Vermont Department of Public Service today announced $1 million in federal funding will soon come to Vermont to establish sustainable energy projects at elementary, middle, and high schools across the state – as well as municipal buildings such as public libraries and town halls. The funds were secured by Sanders through the Congressionally Directed Spending process through the U.S. Department of Energy, and will be administered by the Vermont Public Service Department.“To my mind, the future of our planet and the future of our young people go hand in hand,” said Sanders. “As we take on the existential threat of climate change for future generations, we must make sure we are also fighting for the students and young people growing up today, right now. These solar and sustainable energy projects in Vermont schools and public buildings are a critically important step toward building clean, affordable, and renewable energy systems in our communities. Projects like these are exactly what the Congressionally Directed Spending process is all about – bringing federal dollars into our state in a way that directly meets the needs of our local communities in innovative and sustainable ways.”June Tierney, Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service, said, “We are eager to work with Senator Sanders and the U.S. Department of Energy in bringing sustainable energy solutions to our towns and public schools, especially those that are struggling economically to afford clean energy solutions for their buildings.”The funding will deliver solar panels and other sustainable energy projects to at least ten Vermont elementary, middle, and high schools, with an emphasis on schools with a high percentage of low income students. The solar arrays will not only generate electricity and reduce the schools’ carbon footprint, but also help to lower their costs. Schools will also be able to use these clean energy projects for hands-on learning about the importance of sustainable energy. The funding will also be used to develop and build sustainable energy projects at municipal buildings, including town halls and public libraries.Vermont has already seen success in bringing solar energy to schools. In 2010, Crossett Brook Middle School was one of ten schools awarded $50,000 in federal funding secured by Sanders to install solar. Following this initial investment, Crossett Brook has gone on to install an additional 157 kilowatts of ground-mounted solar. Altogether, these solar projects generate the equivalent of roughly one-third of the school’s electrical needs.

Today, the care workforce at large represents millions of workers across the country, including 2 million child care workers. Despite their important work, on average, child care workers make less than parking lot attendants and pet sitters at just $13.31 per hour, and more than 50 percent rely on public assistance programs.

Meanwhile, child care is increasingly unaffordable and hard to find for working families, who rely on child care to ensure their children are safe and cared for while they go to work each day.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Braun, Grassley, Warren, Wyden Send Letter to Secretary of Defense Urging Investigation of Price Gouging by U.S. Defense Contractors
Date: May 25, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., May 25 – Following a CBS Newsinvestigationthat uncovered repeated instances of defense contractors overcharging the Department of Defense (DOD) to secure excess profits of 40 to 50 percent, costing the U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Wednesday sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III urging a thorough investigation.

“These companies have abused the trust government has placed in them, exploiting their position as sole suppliers for certain items to increase prices far above inflation or any reasonable profit margin,” wrote the senators.

The CBS News report found that the DOD would often negotiate fixed price contracts providing for private profits of 12 to 15 percent, only for Pentagon analysts to find overcharges that boosted total profits to nearly 40 percent or more. Massive overcharges from defense contractors accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars were uncovered in the investigation. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, and TransDigm are among the offenders, dramatically overcharging the DOD and U.S. taxpayers while reaping enormous profits, seeing their stock prices soar, and handing out massive executive compensation packages.

The letter comes after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report earlier this year showed that the DOD accounting systems cannot generate reliable and complete information and are unable to even capture and post transactions to the correct accounts, in violation of statutory requirements. In 2021, a separate GAO report showed that the DOD had failed to implement a comprehensive approach to combat department-wide fraud, despite regularly awarding contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

“The DOD can no longer expect Congress or the American taxpayer to underwrite record military spending while simultaneously failing to account for the hundreds of billions it hands out every year to spectacularly profitable private corporations,” the senators continued. “We ask that you please provide us an update on the Department’s efforts to implement outstanding GAO recommendations related to financial management and fraud risk reduction, as well as your efforts to investigate the price gouging uncovered by CBS’ recent reporting.”

Currently, only 25 percent of U.S. workers have access to paid family leave through an employer and 34 million workers lack any paid sick time at all – including 25 percent of the private sector workforce and 9 percent of the public sector workforce. Things are worse for low-income workers and households, and reached a breaking point for millions of Americans during the pandemic. Less than a third of private sector workers in the bottom 10 percent of income have access to paid sick leave. Nearly one in four employed mothers return to work within two weeks of giving birth and one in five retirees have left the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member. Estimates report more than 2 million women left the U.S. workforce since the start of the pandemic, many forced to leave to care for their family.DetailsWhat:Rally for Paid Sick Days & Family and Medical LeaveWho:

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Sanders and Jayapal to Hold Town Hall on Medicare for All at U.S. Capitol
Date: May 12, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 12 – At a time when 68,000 Americans die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need and more than 1.1 million people in the United States have lost their lives to the pandemic – at least one third of which have been linked to lack of health insurance – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) will hold a town hall at the U.S. Capitol with nurses, doctors, other health care workers, and patients on the need for Medicare for All and health care as a human right for all people across this country.“The American people understand, as I do, that health care is a human right, not a privilege,” said Sanders, Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. “It is not acceptable to me, nor to the American people, that over 85 million people today are either uninsured or underinsured. As we speak, there are millions of people who would like to go to a doctor but cannot afford to do so. This is an outrage. In America, your health and your longevity should not be dependent on your wealth. After this terrible pandemic that took so many lives, it is clearer now, perhaps more than it has ever been before. It is long past time that Congress acts to save lives. It is long past time to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its citizens.”“We live in a country where millions of people ration lifesaving medication or skip necessary trips to the doctor because of cost,” said Jayapal. “Sadly, the number of people struggling to afford care continues to skyrocket as 15 million people lose their current health insurance as pandemic-era programs end. Breaking a bone or getting sick shouldn’t be a reason that people in the richest country in the world go broke. There is a solution to this health crisis — a popular one that guarantees health care to every person as a human right and finally puts people over profits and care over corporations. That solution is Medicare for All — everyone in, nobody out. I’m so proud to fight for this legislation to finally ensure that all people can get the care they need and the care they deserve.”Today in the U.S., tens of thousands of people die each year because they cannot afford health insurance and millions more suffer unnecessarily because of delayed treatment. About 44 percent of the adult population, some 112 million Americans, are struggling to pay for the medical care they need, and more than 85 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured because of high deductibles and premiums. In addition, life expectancy in the U.S. continues to be much lower than most other industrialized countries and infant mortality rates are much higher. During the pandemic, the crisis that is the American health care system only worsened. And yet, the U.S. continues to spend twice as much per capita on health care than virtually any other major nation.Sanders and Jayapal along with their colleagues in the Senate and House will introduce the legislation next week.Town Hall DetailsWhat:Health Care Is A Human Right: A Town Hall on the Need for Medicare for AllWho:

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Omar, Gillibrand, Heinrich, McGovern, Moore and Colleagues in House and Senate Seek to Permanently End Child Hunger in Schools

WASHINGTON, May 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), and Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), along with 15 colleagues in the Senate and 68 in the House of Representatives, today introduced legislation that provides a permanent solution to end child hunger in schools by offering free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack to all students, preschool through high school, regardless of income, eliminating all school meal debt, and strengthening local economies by incentivizing local food procurement.

The Universal School Meals Program Act of 2023 builds on the highly successful universal free school meals program that Congress funded to combat the spike in child and youth hunger brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. While various efforts were made to bolster and extend the program since 2020, it expired in September 2022 leaving nearly 30 million children who rely on free or reduced-price lunch in a state of uncertainty and strain.

The legislation is cosponsored by Sens.

“It is an international embarrassment that today, in the richest country in the history of the world, we are seeing record numbers of children and youth struggling with hunger on a daily basis,”said Sen. Sanders.“We cannot continue to prop up a grossly unjust economy in which the very rich get richer while millions of working families struggle to afford the most basic necessities of life, from paying for rent and medications to feeding their children. Kids cannot learn if they are hungry and every child deserves a quality education free of hunger. What we’ve seen during this pandemic is that a universal approach to school meals works. We cannot go backwards. It is time for Congress to pass this legislation to ensure no student goes hungry again.”

“No child should be forced to learn on an empty stomach,”said Rep. Omar.“At the outset of the pandemic, I authored and passed the MEALS Act to make sure every school district had the flexibility to continue providing school meals to every student. As a result, nearly 30 million children were fed. Five states, including my home state of Minnesota, have now addressed child hunger in their states by passing free and universal school meals for all, and over a dozen others support similar policies. Universal school meals is not just commonsense policy; it is also extremely popular. Nearly 75% of Americans support permanent universal school meals—including majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It’s time to listen to the demands of our constituents and at long last make school meals free and universal for all kids.”

“In the richest country on earth, it is unacceptable that millions of kids go hungry each day,”said Sen. Gillibrand.“The Universal School Meals Program Act would provide funding for free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack for students who need them and slash burdensome red tape for school administrators. It would make our families and communities healthier and stronger, keep kids in school, and work to fight the stigma too often associated with meal programs. I’m proud to be introducing this critical legislation today and look forward to getting it passed.”

“Every child deserves a quality education and a fair shot at success. No child deserves to go hungry. I am working hard to deliver resources for our kids’ education, and I am going to work equally hard to make sure our kids are fed – so that the pangs of hunger aren’t undercutting the opportunities ahead of them,” saidSen. Heinrich, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing USDA nutrition programs.“This legislation would take New Mexico’s recent universal school meals and make it permanent nationwide, while also helping to save our state up to $30 million annually. When we invest in our children, we invest in our future.”

“No child in America should be hungry—period, end of story,”said Congressman James P. McGovern.“In the richest country in the history of the world, every child that does not have enough to eat is a policy failure and a moral outrage. We have a responsibility not just to teach kids reading and math, but to ensure they have healthy, nutritious food at school. I’m proud to work with Senator Sanders and Congresswoman Omar on this important legislation to continue building the political will to end hunger once and for all. Our kids deserve nothing less.”

Rep. Moore said:“Providing free school meals is a crucial investment in the health, education, and well-being of America’s children. It ensures that all students, regardless of their family’s financial situation, have access to nutritious meals that support their physical and mental development. Additionally, free school breakfasts and lunches have been shown to improve academic performance, reduce absenteeism, and decrease food insecurity. This legislation is a crucial step in creating a more equitable educational system by ensuring that all students have the nourishment they need to succeed, as well as lifting the financial burden and stigma off families struggling to afford food. By investing in our children’s future through free school meals, we are also investing in the future of our communities and our nation.”

More than 34 million Americans today, including 9 million children, are food insecure, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. By offering universal school meals during the pandemic, schools across the nation helped to reduce food insecurity in struggling households with children by about 7 percent from 2020 to the summer of 2021. However, without a permanent solution to provide free meals to all students, schools eventually reverted to the complicated myriad of paperwork, programs, and social stigma that leave out or discourage too many young people from accessing meals throughout the day. Upon the expiration of the pandemic meal waivers, many students from homes with incomes just above 130 percent of the poverty line, $34,450 for a family of four, were no longer able to receive free meals at school.

However, again and again, studies show that students with access to free breakfast have improved attendance rates and perform better in school. Free and accessible school meals have also shown to reduce financial stress for students and families, improve health outcomes in students, reduce stigma associated with the programs, and lead to fewer behavioral incidents and lower suspension rates. Teachers, principals, and school leaders across the country have also ranked hunger as a top issue affecting their students’ learning and health.

The Universal School Meals Program Act of 2023 provides the most cost-effective and inclusive model for students, families, teachers, public schools, childcare providers, and communities by ensuring all students have access to nutritious meals throughout the day. In addition to providing free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack to all school children and youth regardless of income, this legislation:

The Universal School Meals Program Act of 2023 is endorsed by nearly 100 organizations, including Aki’s Kitchen, American Heart Association, Appetite For Change, Association of State Public Health Nutritionists (ASPHN), Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, Church Women United in New York State, City Harvest, Climate Reality Project SWPA, Community Kitchen Pittsburgh, Food Research and Action Center, Fruit Belt Advisory Council, Galway CSD, GRACE/End Child Poverty California, Grassroots Gardens WNY, Guilford Public Schools, Hawaii Children’s Action Network Speaks!, Health and Welfare Council of Long Island-Kierste, HOPE, Hunger Free America, Hunger solutions minnesota, Idaho Hunger Relief Task Force, Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Minneapolis, Just Harvest, Lettuce Turnip the Beet Sustainability Collective, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Macedon Public Library, MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, Mid-South Foodbank SNAP Coordinator, Middlebury Natural Foods Co-op, MidSouth Food Bank, National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter, National Education Association, National Family Family Coalition, NEA-NM, New York School Nutrition association, Norwich Public Schools, Our Community Cares Camp, Parent Voices CA, Partners for a Hunger-Free Oregon, Pittsburgh food policy council, Plant it Further, School Nutrition Association, Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee, Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, Shriver Center on Poverty Law, Sierra Harvest, Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior, Soul Fire Farm, South Carolina Appleseed Legal Justice Center, St. Peter RC School, Tennessee Justice Center, University District Food Bank, and Vernon Public Schools.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: HELP Committee Brings CEOs of Major Insulin Manufacturers and PBMs Together for Historic Hearing to Discuss the Need to Lower Insulin Prices and the Cost of Other Prescription Drugs
Date: May 10, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, today led the committee in a hearing titled “The Need to Make Insulin Affordable for All Americans,” which heard testimony from the CEOs of major insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, and top executives from the major pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) of CVS Health, Express Scripts, and OptumRX.Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.First, let me begin by thanking the CEOs of Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk – the three major manufacturers of insulin – as well as the heads of CVS/Caremark, Express Scripts, and Optum Rx – the three major Pharmacy Benefit Managers – for being with us today. You all had to juggle busy schedules and I appreciate your willingness to be here today.I also want to take this opportunity to thank Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk for, in recent months, substantially lowering their lists prices for some of their insulin products. That’s an important step forward.And as we gather today to discuss the insulin crisis, I want to acknowledge those whom we have lost because they could not afford the insulin that they needed to keep them alive.Alec Smith, was 24 years old and dreamed of opening a sports bar. He is dead.Antavia Lee-Worsham was 22-years old and worked two jobs. She is dead.Allen Rivas was 20 years old and had already lost his home because of insulin costs. He’s dead.And these are just a few of the many Americans who have needlessly lost their lives because of the unaffordability of insulin.Further, we must also acknowledge the thousands who wound up in emergency rooms and hospitals suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis – a very serious medical condition as a result of rationing their insulin.This committee is convening today for two major reasons – and one of those is a little bit personal for me. Three years ago I took a busload of American diabetics from Detroit, Michigan to Windsor Ontario to purchase the life-saving insulin that they needed for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States. One-tenth of the price for the exact same product. At that time I promised them that I would do whatever I could to end that insanity, and I intend to keep that promise. That’s one reason for this hearing.Secondly, this committee is determined to end the outrage in which Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for virtually every brand name prescription drug on the market – whether it is a drug for cancer, heart disease, asthma, or whatever. We want to know why there are Americans who are dying, or are becoming much sicker than they should, because they can’t afford the medicine they need. Why, in the richest country on Earth, do 1.3 million Americans ration insulin because of the cost? Why are 1 out of 4 Americans not able to afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe?And let’s be clear. The high cost of prescription drugs not only impacts the health of individual Americans, but the budget of the United States. If we paid the same prices for prescription drugs as major countries around the rest of the world were paying, we could save over a trillion dollars over 10 years. Further, we would drive down the cost of healthcare in America which is now double the cost of almost any other major nation.And let’s also be clear. While Americans pay outrageously high prices for prescription drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and the PBMs make enormous profits.In 2021, 10 major pharmaceutical companies in America made over $100 billion in profits – a 137% increase from the previous year. The 50 top executives in these companies received over $1.9 billion in total compensation in 2021 and are in line to receive billions more in golden parachutes once they leave their companies.Last year, the 3 major PBMs in America made $27.5 billion in profits – a 483% increase over the past decade. These PBMs manage 80 percent of all prescription drugs in America.In other words, Americans die, get sicker than they should and go bankrupt because they cannot afford the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, while the drug companies and the PBMs make huge profits. That has got to change and this committee is going to do everything possible to bring about that change.Let’s get back to insulin. Importantly, and not discussed very often, a vial of insulin costs less than $10 to manufacture.Meanwhile, Eli Lilly increased the price of Humalog 34 times since 1996 from $21 to $275—a 1,200 percent increase. The same exact product. No changes at all. The only reason for the huge increase in price during that period was that there was no legislation to stop them. In America, the drug companies could charge any price they want.But it’s not just Eli Lilly.Novo Nordisk increased the price of Novolog 28 times from $40 in 2001 to $289—a 625 percent increase.And then there is Sanofi – a company that increased the price of Lantus 28 times from $35 in 2001 to $292—a 730 percent increase.In every instance it is the same exact product that rose astronomically.And let’s be clear. This is a problem that is unique to the United States. In France, 20 years ago, the cost of Lantus was $40. Today, it has gone down to just $24.Meanwhile, as insulin manufacturers continued to increase prices, PBMs signed secret deals to increase their profits by putting insulin products on their formularies not with the lowest list price but the ones that gave PBMs the most generous rebates.The good news is that as a result of public outrage, a strong grassroots movement and government action, major pharmaceutical companies have announced that they will be substantially reducing the price of some insulin products.Eli Lilly announced it would reduce the price of Humalog by 70 percent later this year—from $275 to $83. Eli Lilly also decreased the price of its generic Humalog to $25 per vial.Novo Nordisk announced it would reduce the price of Novolog by 75 percent beginning next year—from $289 to $72.Sanofi announced it would reduce the price of Lantus by 78 percent beginning next year—from $292 to $64.Our job today, as I see it, is twofold.First, we must make sure that these price reductions go into effect so that every American with diabetes gets the insulin they need at an affordable price. This committee intends to hold a hearing early next year to make certain that happens.But lowering the cost of insulin is only one part of what we must accomplish.This committee must do everything possible to make sure that the American people no longer pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.And we’ve got to ask some hard questions.If Eli Lilly can lower the price of Humalog by 70 percent, why is it still charging the American people about $200,000 for Cyramza (CYR-AMZA) to treat stomach cancer – a drug that can be purchased in Germany for just $54,000?If Novo Nordisk can lower the price of Novolog by 75%, why is it still charging Americans with diabetes $12,000 for Ozempic when the exact same drug can be purchased for just $2,000 in Canada?If Sanofi can reduce the price of Lantus by 78%, why is it still charging cancer patients in America over $200,000 for Caprelsa – a drug that can be purchased in Japan for just $37,000.We have got to ask how does it happen that nearly half of all new drugs cost over $150,000?How does it happen that cancer drugs which, in some cases, cost just a few dollars to manufacture are selling on the market for over $100,000?Now I know that our guests from the drug companies will tell us how much it costs to develop a new drug and how often the research for new cures is not successful. I get that. But what they are going to have to explain to us is why, over the past decade, 14 major pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, spent $747 billion on stock buybacks and dividends.The truth is that these 14 major drug companies have spent $87 billion more on stock buybacks and dividends over the past decade than what they spent on research and development.They will also have to explain how as an entire industry pharma spent $8.5 billion on lobbying and over $745 million on campaign contributions over the past 25 years to get Congress to do its bidding.Unbelievably, last year, drug companies hired over 1,700 lobbyists including the former congressional leaders of both major political parties – that’s over 3 pharmaceutical industry lobbyists for every Member of Congress.Maybe I’m wrong, but I think that could well explain why we pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world and why today drug companies can set the price of new drugs at any level they wish.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces More Than $3 Million in Federal Funds for Affordable Housing in Vermont
Date: May 10, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced today that Vermont will receive more than $3 million from the National Housing Trust Fund.Sanders first introduced legislation to create the National Housing Trust Fund in 2001, based on the success of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust Fund. Sanders succeeded in establishing the program nationwide in 2008. This year’s more than $3 million award is the second largest for Vermont in the fund’s history. The purpose of the fund is to build, preserve, rehabilitate, and operate affordable housing for low-income people in Vermont and across the country.“Simply put, a decent, safe, and affordable place to live is a fundamental human right, not a privilege” Sanders said. “And yet, here in Vermont and across the country, we are in the midst of a housing crisis that is completely unacceptable. Built from Vermont’s own model, the National Housing Trust Fund plays an important role in addressing that crisis by putting federal funding to work to ensure safe, affordable, and accessible housing for Vermonters most in need, including the nearly 3,000 people experiencing homelessness across our state. But it is not enough. We must do more to make sure all Vermonters have a place to call home.”One in five Americans spendat least halfof their incomes on housing and utilities. The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s annual Out of Reach report hasVermont rankedas the 19th most expensive state in the country overall – and the 9th most expensive for state nonmetropolitan areas – when comparing the cost of a modest two-bedroom apartment with wages. Today, a minimum wage worker in Vermont must work 75 hours a week to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.Gus Seelig, Executive Director of the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board, which administers the National Housing Trust Fund in Vermont, said: “National Housing Trust Funds play a large part in helping to create and rehabilitate housing serving Vermont’s most vulnerable households, especially for the many individuals and families that are experiencing homelessness. We appreciate Senator Sanders’ leadership over many years in helping to establish and ensure continued funding under the program.”Over the last year, Vermont’s share of the National Housing Trust Fund has helped jumpstart important projects across the state, including transforming a historic 1920s era building in Bellows Falls into 27 high-quality and affordable homes, and redeveloping a three-story residential building with apartments and a shared community space in Windsor. The Windsor project also received a Congressionally Directed Spendingawardthrough Sanders.

BURLINGTON, Vt., April 28 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Friday joined the Scoopers of Ben & Jerry’s Burlington Scoop Shop as they announced that they are organizing a union and that Ben & Jerry’s has agreed to sign the Fair Election Principles, a code of corporate conduct for union elections to ensure that every worker can exercise their right to join a union without intimidation or harassment.

Sanders’ remarks in support of the workers, as prepared for delivery, are below.

Let me first congratulate every worker at the Church Street Ben and Jerry’s for unanimously taking the courageous step of forming a union.

You have joined the wave of union organizing across the country where tens and thousands of workers are coming together, and I’m proud to see workers right here in Burlington becoming part of this historical moment.

At the same time, we are seeing major corporations engage in vicious and illegal union busting behavior – we have seen this from Starbucks, Amazon, and many more.

That’s why, it is very good news that here in Burlington, Ben and Jerry’s have listened to their workers and have agreed to the Fair Election Principles that the “Scoopers” have asked for.

These fair election principals ensure that every worker can exercise their right to join a union without intimidation or harassment.

Ben & Jerry’s has a long and proud history of being a progressive and socially conscious company. I am encouraged to see the company respond in a positive way to workplace organizing and I hope very much that they will now negotiate a fair first contract.

This sets an important example for what all companies can and should do. I hope that Starbucks and other companies who are so aggressively engaging in anti-union behavior, follow the lead of Ben & Jerry’s and live up to their “progressive values.”

And I hope that Starbucks will sit down with South Burlington workers and bargain a fair first contract.

Let me once again congratulate you all for standing up and fighting for fair wages, decent benefits, and dignity on the job.

WASHINGTON, April 21 – Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Friday that the committee will hold a hearing entitled “The Need to Make Insulin Affordable for All Americans” on Wednesday, May 10 at 1:00 p.m. ET.The CEOs from the major insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, and top executives from the major pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) of CVS Health, Express Scripts, and OptumRX, will testify.“As a result of public outrage and strong grassroots efforts, major pharmaceutical companies recently announced that they would be substantially reducing the price of insulin,” Sanders said. “That’s an important step forward. We must make certain, however, that those price reductions go into effect in a way that results in every American getting the insulin they need at an affordable price. But that’s not all. We have got to substantially lower the price of all prescription drugs. The United States cannot continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while drug companies and PBMs make billions in profits. That’s what this hearing is all about.”In 1923, the inventors of insulin sold their patent for $1 to save lives, not to make pharmaceutical executives extremely wealthy. While researchers estimate a vial of insulin costs just $8 to manufacture, the price has gone up by over 1,000 percent since 1996. Sanofi’s Lantus costs $292 per vial. Novo Nordisk’s Novolog is listed at $289. Eli Lilly’s Humalog can be purchased for $275. People with diabetes face nearly $17,000 per year in medical expenses, more than half of which is directly attributable to their diabetes. In the U.S., health care for people with diabetes accounts for one in four health care dollars.Meanwhile, 1.3 million Americans were forced to ration insulin last year because of the unaffordable cost of this lifesaving drug. In 2019, Sanders took a busload of people with diabetes from Michigan to Canada, where they were able to purchase the same insulin products they bought in the U.S. for one-tenth the price.Following a majorpublic pressure campaign, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi – which together make up 90 percent of the insulin market in the U.S. – recently announced they would cut the prices of their most popular insulins by 70 percent or more.

Title: NEWS: As Republicans Move to Provide a $1.8 Trillion Tax Giveaway to Billionaires, Sanders Introduces Bill to Make the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share
Date: April 18, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 18 – While 41 Senate Republicans recently introduced legislation to permanently repeal the estate tax – which would provide a $1.8 trillion tax giveaway to billionaires in America and would only provide relief to the top one-tenth of one percent – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, today introduced a progressive estate tax bill that would make sure that the wealthiest people in America pay their fair share.

Joining Sanders on The For the 99.5 Percent Act is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Senate, while Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) today introduced the companion bill in the House. The legislation is also endorsed by Americans for Tax Fairness, a coalition of more than 420 national, state, and local endorsing organizations, including AFL-CIO, AFSCME, Patriotic Millionaires, and Public Citizen.

“Over and over again, Republicans in Washington have professed their deep concern about the national debt and yet virtually all of them have signed onto legislation that would provide a $1.8 trillion tax giveaway to billionaires by repealing the estate tax,” Sen. Sanders said. “How absurd is that? At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we need to make sure that people who inherit over $3.5 million pay their fair share of taxes. We do not need to provide a huge handout to multi-millionaires and billionaires. It is unacceptable that working families across the country today are struggling to file their taxes on time and put food on the table, while the wealthiest among us profit off of enormous tax loopholes and giant tax breaks. The legislation that I am introducing today will begin to reform our rigged tax code that has benefitted the wealthy and powerful for far too long.”

The For the 99.5 Percent Act establishes a new progressive estate tax rate structure on the top 0.5 percent of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million in wealth. It also imposes a 45 percent tax rate on estates worth $3.5 million and a 65 percent tax rate on the value of an estate worth over $1 billion. This is not a radical idea. In fact, from 1941-1976, the top estate tax rate was 77 percent on estates worth more than $50 million.

This legislation would also end tax breaks for dynasty trusts, close other loopholes in the estate and gift tax, and provide protections for family farmers by allowing them to lower the value of their farmland by up to $3 million for estate tax purposes.

“For too long, the ultra-rich have abused our tax code to acquire enormous amounts of wealth while working Americans, especially those of color, fall further behind. The 50 wealthiest individuals in our country right now own more wealth than the poorest half of all Americans combined, while the poorest 40 percent of Americans have hardly any savings at all,” said Rep. Gomez. “Our legislation strengthens the estate tax and helps restore fairness and equity to our nation’s tax code. I’m proud to partner with Senator Sanders on this legislation to uplift America’s working class.”

“For years, billionaires and multi-millionaires have gotten away with paying little to nothing in taxes,” said Sen. Warren. “This legislation will help us fix our broken tax system by closing loopholes that the ultra-wealthy use to dodge paying their fair share. Congress should pass this bill so we can invest in working families and build a brighter future for all of our children.”

More than a century ago, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt fought for the creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous concentration of wealth that existed during the Gilded Age. Roosevelt’s efforts are even more relevant in today’s America where the billionaire class pays a lower effective tax rate than the working class.

Under this legislation, 99.5 percent of Americans would not owe a penny more in taxes. However, the families of all 735 billionaires in America – who have a combined net worth of more than $4.5 trillion – would owe up to $1 trillion more in additional estate taxes. In contrast, the Republican’s so-called “Death Tax Repeal Act” would provide these billionaires with a tax break of up to nearly $1.8 trillion while it would not provide one penny to 99.9 percent of families who inherit less than $12.92 million. For example:

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a previous version of the For the 99.5 Percent Act would raise $430 billion over its first 10 years of enactment.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Sanders, NDWA, SEIU to Hold Town Hall on the Child and Home Care Worker Crisis in America
Date: April 13, 2023

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Tuesday, April 18, will be joined by Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), chairman of the HELP Subcommittee on Children and Families, Ai-jen Poo, President of National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), and Mary Kay Henry, International President of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for a town hall at the U.S. Capitol on the crisis facing care workers across America.“Care work is the work that makes all other work possible,” said Sanders. “Our economy does not function as we know it without the millions of workers who provide child care, home health care, direct care, and long-term care throughout this country. Yet still, in the year 2023, these skilled, dedicated, and essential workers too often go unseen, undervalued, and unprotected. That must change so that all care workers can have fair wages and the basic rights and dignity on the job that they deserve.”Excluded from the protections of many employment and labor laws drafted throughout U.S. history, countless home care workers still go without basic workplace standards like overtime pay, safe working conditions, and protections against sexual harassment. Today, the care workforce at large represents millions of workers across the country, including 2.6 million home care workers, 2 million child care workers, and 2.1 million additional direct care workers. However, 40 percent of direct care workers live in or near poverty, 43 percent rely on public assistance programs to make ends meet, and more than 90 percent are women – disproportionately immigrants and women of color – who earn a median wage of $14 per hour. On average, child care workers make less than doggy daycare workers and pet sitters at just $13.31 per hour, and more than 50 percent rely on public assistance programs.From 2011 to 2021, the home care workforce more than doubled in size, while nearly 60,000 child care workers left the sector during the pandemic and haven’t returned.DetailsWhat:Standing with Care Workers: A Town Hall on the Child and Home Care Worker Crisis in AmericaWho:

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Questions Howard Schultz in HELP Committee Hearing and Calls on Starbucks to End the Illegal Union Busting
Date: March 29, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 29 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, today led the committee in a hearing titled, “No Company Is Above the Law: The Need to End Illegal Union Busting at Starbucks.”Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.Let me get to the point of this hearing. Today in America, over 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, and millions are working for starvation wages. Unbelievably, despite an explosion in technology and increases in worker productivity, the average worker is making over $50 a week less today than he or she made 50 years ago – after adjusting for inflation. Unless we change the nature of our economy, it is likely that the younger generation will have a lower standard of living than their parents.What that means is that workers throughout our country are struggling to pay for housing, struggling to pay for healthcare and prescription drugs, struggling to put food on the table, struggling to pay off their student debt and deal with other basic necessities. And while that is the reality for the working class of our country, here is another reality. And that is that the people on top have never had it so good. Today in America, we have more income and wealth inequality than we’ve ever had with the top 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, with CEOs now making 400 times more than their workers, and with 3 people on top now owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That’s the economic reality that exists today. The rich get much richer, working families struggle.And, as a result of that reality, what we are now seeing is a major increase in trade union organizing. Throughout our country, in blue collar jobs and in white collar jobs, workers are standing up and fighting back and are forming unions in order to improve their wages, their benefits, their working conditions.These workers know, as I do, that union workers earn nearly 20% more, on average, than non-union workers. These workers also know, as I do, that union workers have better health care benefits, better paid family and medical leave policies, are much more likely to have a pension and are less likely to be victims of health and safety violations compared to non-union workers.At a time when 71% of the American people now approve of unions – the highest level since 1965 — there has been a major revitalization of the trade union movement in our country. Between 2021 and 2022, the number of union elections taking place in America has gone up by 53% and since 2020 workers have voted to form a union in over 70 percent of union elections.That’s the good news for those of us who understand that strong unions are a vital part of rebuilding the declining middle class in this country.The bad news is that in order to combat this increase in union organizing, corporations have engaged in an unprecedented level of illegal union busting activities.Which takes us to the focus of today’s hearing.Over the past 18 months, Starbucks has waged the most aggressive and illegal union busting campaign in the modern history of our country. That union busting campaign has been led by Howard Schultz, the multi-billionaire founder and director of Starbucks who is with us this morning only under the threat of subpoena.Let’s be clear about the nature of Starbucks vicious anti-union efforts. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed over 80 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor law, there have been over 500 unfair labor practice charges lodged against this company and judges have found that Starbucks broke the law 130 times across six states since workers began organizing in the fall of 2021.These violations include the illegal firing of more than a dozen Starbucks workers for “the crime” of exercising their right to form a union and to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.Since the first Starbucks union was certified more than 450 days ago in Buffalo, workers at more than 360 stores across nearly 40 states have held union elections. 83 percent of these elections have resulted in a union victory and today nearly 300 Starbucks coffee shops employing more than 7,000 workers have a union – despite Starbucks aggressive anti-union campaign. But with nearly 300 shops voting to form a union, Starbucks has refused to sign a single first contract with the union. Not a single one. Think about it.A multi-billion dollar company, with unlimited resources, with all kinds of lawyers, advisors, consultants, has not yet signed one contract with any of their nearly 300 unionized shops.Just a few weeks ago, on March 1st, an Administrative Law Judge found Starbucks guilty of “egregious and widespread misconduct” which showed “a general disregard for the employees’ fundamental rights.”In a 220-page ruling, this judge found that Starbucks illegally retaliated against employees for unionizing; promised improved pay and benefits if workers rejected the union; conducted illegal surveillance of pro-union workers; refused to hire prospective employees who supported the union; relocated union organizers to new stores and overstaffed stores ahead of union votes – all clear violations of federal labor law.The judge also found that Starbucks “widespread coercive behavior over six months had permeated every store in the Buffalo market.”The judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven workers who were wrongfully terminated, re-open a pro-union store in Buffalo that was illegally shut down, and pay “reasonable consequential damages” to more than two dozen workers whose rights were violated by Starbucks.And let’s be clear. Starbucks egregious union busting campaign is not limited to Buffalo. It is happening all over America.Federal courts in Tennessee and Michigan have issued emergency injunctions requiring Starbucks to reinstate workers who were illegally fired and to prohibit the coffee chain from firing workers for supporting unionization efforts in the future.In Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona, the NLRB has charged Starbucks with committing eight violations of labor law when it disciplined, fired, and forced out workers because they cooperated with federal investigations.On November 30th of last year, the NLRB found that Starbucks unlawfully refused to recognize and bargain with the union at its Reserve Roastery Store in Seattle.NLRB judges have found that Starbucks illegally threatened to withhold benefits (including health insurance) from pro-union workers in Denver, Colorado; Overland Park, Kansas; Seattle, Washington; and Ann Arbor, Michigan.The pattern in all of these stores is clear: On the one hand, you have workers making $13, $14 or $15 an hour with minimal benefits, working 20, 30 or 40 hours a week depending on a totally unpredictable schedule dictated by their managers, trying to achieve dignity and justice on the job. On the other hand, we have a corporation worth $113 billion controlled by an individual worth nearly $4 billion who are using their unlimited resources to do everything possible, legal and illegal, to deny these workers their constitutional rights.The fundamental issue we are confronting today is whether we have a system of justice that applies to all, or whether billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity. I have read Mr. Schultz’s comments to the media in which he expresses his strong anti-union views. As an American, Mr. Schultz is entitled to those views and any other views he holds. But even if he is a multi-billionaire and the leader of a large corporation he is not entitled to break the law.So today, I will be asking Mr. Schultz whether he will do what an Administrative Law Judge has ordered him to do. And that is to record and distribute a 14-page notice which states that Starbucks has violated Federal labor law, to inform Starbucks employees about their rights under the National Labor Relations Act, how Starbucks has violated those rights, and to assure that Starbucks will not infringe upon those rights in the future.In other words, I will be asking Mr. Schultz whether or not he intends to obey the law. Further, I will be asking Mr. Schultz another question. And that is whether or not he is prepared to promise this committee that within 14 days of this hearing, Starbucks will exchange proposals with the union, something it has refused to do for more than 450 days, so that meaningful progress can be made to bargain a first contract in good faith.What is outrageous to me is not only Starbucks anti-union activities and their willingness to break the law, it is their calculated and intentional efforts to stall, stall and stall. They understand that the turnover rate at Starbucks is high. They understand that if workers do not see success in getting a contract and improved wages they may get discouraged. So what Starbucks is doing is not only trying to break unions, but even worse. They are trying to break the spirit of workers who are struggling to improve their lives. And that is unforgivable.

Title: NEWS: HELP MAJORITY STAFF REPORT ON STARBUCKS
Date: March 26, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
Over the past 18 months, Starbucks has waged an aggressive and illegal union-busting campaign. That campaign has been directed and led by Howard Schultz, the multi-billionaire CEO and founder of Starbucks. Under Schultz’s leadership, Starbucks has adopted an aggressively anti-union stance that is reflected in Schultz’s public statements, the company’s communications to workers, and its scorched-earth approach to blocking unionization activity.Though the coffee giant claims they are a “progressive” company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company’s anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed over 80 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor law and there have been over 500 unfair labor practice charges lodged against this company. These violations include the illegal firing of more than a dozen Starbucks workers for “the crime” of exercising their right to form a union and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.Under Schultz’s leadership, Starbucks has become the most aggressive union-busting company in America. Since the first Starbucks union was certified by the NLRB more than 450 days ago, Starbucks has refused to bargain a first contract in good faith. Since the first store voted to unionize in December 2021, in Buffalo, New York, workers at more than 360 stores across nearly 40 states have held union elections. More than eighty percent of these elections have resulted in a union victory leading to nearly 300 unionized Starbucks coffee shops throughout the country, despite an aggressive and illegal anti-union campaign waged by Starbucks under the leadership of Howard Schultz.At Schultz’s direction, Starbucks has fought the attempts of workers every step of the way, resorting to delay tactics and significant escalation in union busting, including unlawfully firing employees, having the police called in response to a peaceful and lawful congregation of workers who were attempting to present their request for union recognition, and illegally shutting down unionized stores.Workers in America have the constitutional right to organize unions and engage in collective bargaining to improve their wages and benefits. For far too long, Starbucks and its multi-billionaire owner have acted as though those laws do not apply to them.On March 29, 2023, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP Committee) will hear testimony from Schultz and begin to hold him accountable. In advance of that hearing, the HELP Committee Majority Staff have documented a series of misleading claims made by Starbucks in order to set the record straight and to encourage the company to negotiate a fair first contract with union workers as required by law.

MYTH: Starbucks says they respect the rights of workers to organize.Starbucks says their employees “have the right to make their voice heard when it comes to union issues” and that the company respects employees’ right to organize. According to Starbucks “no Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined or separated for supporting, organizing, or otherwise engaging in lawful union activity.”FACT: Starbucks has violated the constitutional right of workers to form unions with impunity.Starbucks has taken a firmly anti-union position and is willing to do whatever it takes to stop workers from organizing.

Many workers were fired for reasons that border on the absurd.

Starbucks also took actions to chill organizing efforts without firing workers.

In Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona, in March 2022, Starbucks is accused of committing eight violations of labor law when it disciplined, fired, and forced out workers because they cooperated with NLRB investigations. A pro-union Starbucks worker in Phoenix said that hours had been cut “25 to 50 [percent]” especially for workers who wore union pins.
MYTH: Howard Schultz is not involved in decisions about labor relations.Starbucks maintains that Schultz “does not have an academic background, legal license, or professional practice in labor law” and that “Howard Schultz delegated decision-making regarding actions to be taken on union issues to a small team of executives.”FACT: Howard Schultz is, and has always been, the architect of Starbucks’ anti-union campaign.Schultz’s animosity towards unions goes back decades.

Schultz originally acquired Starbucks in the late 1980s when the company had unionized stores and a unionized roasting plant. He played a crucial role in decertifying the union over the next few years in coffee shops and the roasting plant as he built Starbucks national profile.
Months before Schultz officially returned as Starbucks CEO, he engaged in a failed and illegal attempt to block workers from unionizing.

Schultz did not give up his anti-union campaign when the first stores unionized. Instead, he returned to the company in early 2022 as “interim” CEO and escalated his anti-union efforts.

Beyond stating his own opinion, Schultz has also made a series of public statements that appear calculated to disrupt worker organizing efforts.

The illegal anti-union actions taken by Schultz were so egregious that the NLRB is asking Schultz to record a video personally apologizing to workers at Starbucks for violating their rights.

MYTH: Starbucks says they are bargaining in good faith.

In a letter to Chair Sanders and members of the Senate HELP Committee, Starbucks General Counsel Zabrina Jenkins stated that the company has “extensively engaged in good faith bargaining at more than 200 locations.” Starbucks further claims they have “come to the table in-person and in good faith for more than 85 single-store contract bargaining sessions since [October] 2022 – with more than 60 additional single-store sessions scheduled or proposed across the country since March 2023.”FACT: Starbucks has a clear pattern of refusing to bargain with its unionized employees.

It has been over 450 days since the first Starbucks stores voted to form a union. Starbucks has not taken any meaningful steps to make progress toward actually negotiating a contract in that time period.

In the meantime, Starbucks has been repeatedly sanctioned for failing to bargain.

MYTH: Starbucks is a model employer that other companies should follow.

FACT: Howard Schultz’s own family foundation says Starbucks is near the bottom of food and retail employers with respect to how it treats its workers.In a study of economic outcomes for workers at America’s 250 largest companies, funded in part by the Schultz Family Foundation, Starbucks received the lowest possible rating on its pay and frequency of internal promotions.

The company’s benefits do not match those offered by its peers and competitors.

Even those benefits are at risk for workers choosing to exercise their right to organize.

Starbucks has withheld some especially sensitive benefits from union workers, such as gender-affirming care for transgender employees and travel benefits for employees seeking abortions who live in states where that procedure is illegal.

MYTH: Starbucks has not been found in violation of any law because they have not exhausted all of their appeals in federal courts, up to and including the Supreme Court.Starbucks notes that “NLRB decisions are frequently the subject of review by the courts of appeals and, in some cases the U.S. Supreme Court. Significantly, to date, Starbucks has not been found to have violated the law as part of any enforced order of the NLRB.”FACT: This is a deliberate attempt by Starbucks to delay a first contract for union workers.The NLRB has more than 500 pending cases of Starbucks’ flagrant disregard for the law.

Even within the NLRB, the apparent slowness of NLRB judges’ decisions does not reflect Starbucks’ innocence.

MYTH: Starbucks says organizing only reflects a tiny portion of the workforce and that this shows the vast majority do not want a union.Starbucks repeatedly emphasizes that the unionized workforce is only a small portion of their company. In a letter responding to the HELP Committee announcing a vote to subpoena Schultz, Starbucks claimed this fact was evidence that those employees “have deliberately chosen not to seek union representation.”FACT: Contrary to Starbucks’ claims, it has been their relentless union-busting and stall tactics at bargaining which has slowed down organizing.The union organizing wave has spread far and wide at Starbucks.

Workers repeatedly say that organizing in Buffalo inspired their own efforts.

Hannah McCown, a Kansas Starbucks worker who got her job back after Starbucks fired her for her union drive, said, “We were inspired by the partners in Buffalo that managed to do something many of us have dreamed of for a long time […] It’s something we didn’t think was possible, but they really pushed through and showed the rest of us across the nation that we could use our voices and actually unionize.”
There are increasing signs that organizing may begin among white-collar corporate employees, in part due to their disapproval of the company’s retail store union busting campaign.

CONCLUSIONStarbucks has engaged in the most significant union-busting campaign in modern history. It has been led by Howard Schultz, the company’s founder and three-time CEO, who is synonymous with the brand.Just because Starbucks is a $113 billion company and Howard Schultz is a billionaire with a net worth of $3.7 billion does not mean that they are above the law. They must be held accountable for creating a culture that allows widespread violations of federal labor law in an effort to stop workers from exercising their constitutional right to organize.The good news is that it is not too late to change course. If Starbucks and Howard Schultz publicly apologize to their workers for breaking federal labor law, adequately compensate workers whose rights have been violated, respect the rights of workers to form unions, and negotiate a fair contract in good faith with union workers that pays workers a living wage with good benefits and reliable schedules, they can lead by example.They can show the rest of corporate America that it must value not just an increase in the bottom line for the benefit of wealthy shareholders, but that it must also value the workers responsible for making those profits a reality. That would truly make Starbucks the progressive company that it claims to be.See the report,here.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Howard Schultz to Testify at HELP Committee Hearing on Ending the Illegal Union Busting at Starbucks
Date: March 24, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 24 – Howard Schultz, who helped lead Starbucks for more than forty years and most recently served as CEO of the company, will on Wednesday, March 29 at 10 a.m. ET appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) at a hearing entitled, “No Company Is Above the Law: The Need to End Illegal Union Busting at Starbucks.”

“Let’s be clear. In America, workers have the constitutional right to organize unions and engage in collective bargaining for higher wages and better working conditions,” said HELP Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “Unfortunately Starbucks, under Mr. Schultz’s leadership, has done everything possible to prevent that from happening. The HELP Committee intends to make clear that in America we must not have a two-tiered justice system in which billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity, while working class people are held accountable for their actions. I look forward to hearing from Mr. Schultz as to when he intends to end his illegal anti-union activities and begin signing fair first contracts with the unions.”

Since the first store successfully voted to unionize in Buffalo in December of 2021, workers at more than 350 Starbucks in nearly 40 states across the country have held votes to unionize. Over 80 percent of these elections have resulted in a union victory leading to nearly 300 unionized Starbucks coffee shops throughout the country. As a result of Starbucks refusal to bargain in good faith, none of these union victories have resulted in a first contract. Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued over 80 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor law and there have been over 500 unfair labor practice charges lodged against the company. Mr. Schultz faces nearly 100 charges of violating federal labor law for statements he made during meetings he convened with Starbucks workers throughout the country. Recently, an Administrative Law Judge in New York ruled that Starbucks has engaged in ‘egregious and widespread misconduct’ in a union organizing campaign that started in 2021.

Title: NEWS: After Silicon Valley Bank Collapse, Sanders Introduces Legislation to Prevent Big Bank Executives from Serving on Federal Reserve Boards
Date: March 23, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday introduced legislation to block bank executives like Silicon Valley Bank’s Gregory Becker from serving on regional Federal Reserve boards that regulate the banks they run.

“I think it would come as a shock to most Americans to find out that Gregory Becker, the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, who successfully lobbied for the deregulation of his financial institution was allowed to serve as a director of the same body in charge of regulating his bank: the San Francisco Federal Reserve,” Sanders said. “It is clear to me and to the American people, that the CEOs of the largest banks in America should not be allowed to serve as directors of the main agency we have in this country in charge of regulating those very same financial institutions. The Fed has got to become a more democratic institution that is responsive to the needs of working people and the middle class, not just CEOs of some of the largest financial institutions in America.”

Today, two-thirds of the directors of the 12 regional Federal Reserve boards are hand-picked by the same bankers that the Federal Reserve charged with regulating. Moreover, five CEOs of financial institutions with over $150 billion in assets currently serve as directors of Federal Reserve banks. For example, the CEO of State Street, which has nearly $300 billion in assets, currently serves as a director of the Boston Federal Reserve. The CEO of M&T Bank, which has over $200 billion in assets, currently serves as a director of the New York Fed. The CEO of Ally Bank, which has assets of over $180 billion in assets, is currently a director of the Richmond Fed. And the CEO of Northern Trust, with assets of more than $150 billion, currently serves on the Chicago Fed. All would be prohibited from serving on Federal Reserve regional boards if Sanders’ legislation became law.

A 2011 audit by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) – conducted thanks to a Sanders-introduced provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act – found that allowing members of the banking industry to both elect and serve on the Federal Reserve’s board of directors creates “an appearance of a conflict of interest” and poses “reputational risks” to the Federal Reserve System.

Sanders’ Federal Reserve Independence Act would also prevent Federal Reserve employees and board members from owning any stock or investing in any institution that the central bank is in charge of regulating.

Organizations endorsing this legislation include: Americans for Financial Reform, Demos, Revolving Door Project, Public Citizen, Working Families Party, and Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: HELP Committee Hearing on Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Pricing, CEO to Testify
Date: March 22, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, today led the committee in a hearing titled, “Taxpayers Paid Billions For It: So Why Would Moderna Consider Quadrupling the Price of the COVID Vaccine?”Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.First, let me thank Stephane Bancel, the CEO of Moderna, for being with us today and all of the other panelists who have joined us. Mr. Bancel early on agreed to be here voluntarily and I very much appreciate that.Secondly, I want to congratulate Moderna, Pfizer, other companies, and the great scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies for their extraordinary work in rapidly producing COVID vaccines that have saved millions of lives.This hearing, to my mind, is about several enormously important and inter-related issues.1) In the pharmaceutical industry today we are looking at an unprecedented level of corporate greed – and that is certainly true with Moderna. Today, while 37 percent of the American people could not afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, 10 major pharmaceutical companies made over $100 billion dollars in profits in 2021 – a 137% increase from the previous year. In these corporations, the 50 top executives made over $1.9 billion in total compensation in 2021 and are in line to receive billions more in golden parachutes once they leave their companies. In other words, Americans die because they cannot afford the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, while the drug companies make huge profits.2) Further, while many Americans don’t know this, the taxpayers of this country have spent many tens of billions of dollars over the past decade to research and develop life-saving medicine. Yet, despite that huge investment, and the vitally important work done by NIH scientists, the citizens of the United States pay far more for prescription drugs than do the people of any other country, in some cases, as much as ten times more. Unbelievably, there are important drugs on the market today that literally cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. My question is: What does a lifesaving drug mean for a person who cannot afford to buy that drug?3) Now, in terms of Moderna, the focus of our attention this morning, let’s be clear. The NIH and other federal agencies worked with Moderna to research, develop and distribute the COVID vaccine that so many of our people have effectively used.While Moderna may wish to re-write history, it is widely acknowledged that both Moderna and the NIH created this vaccine together.According to a letter I received from the NIH on March 17th, and which has been distributed to all members, three scientists at the NIH “are co-inventors” of this vaccine who were “integral members of a collaborative team of scientists working to design and produce” it.In other words, this vaccine would not exist without NIH’s partnership and expertise and the substantial investment of the taxpayers of this country.As a matter of public record, U.S. taxpayers spent $12 billion on the research, development and procurement of the NIH-Moderna COVID vaccine.And here is the thank you the taxpayers of this country received from Moderna for that huge investment: They are thanking the taxpayers of America by proposing to quadruple the price of the COVID vaccine to as much as $130 once the government stockpile runs out – at a time when it costs just $2.85 to manufacture that vaccine.What this means is that Moderna will be charging Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, the Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service and insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act billions of dollars more for the COVID vaccine.Meanwhile, Moderna has already made $21 billion in profits off of the COVID vaccine during the pandemic and four of Moderna’s executives and investors collectively became more than $10 billion wealthier as a result of the massive taxpayer investment into that corporation.As soon as Moderna started to receive billions of dollars from the federal government, Mr. Bancel literally became a billionaire overnight and is now worth $4.7 billion. He was also able to secure a golden parachute for himself worth another $926 million after he leaves this company.But let’s be clear. Mr. Bancel is not alone.One of Moderna’s co-founders (Noubar Afeyan) is now worth $1.8 billion. Another co-founder of Moderna, Robert Langer, is now worth $1.7 billion. And one of the founding investors in Moderna (Tim Springer) is now worth $2.2 billion.None of these four individuals were billionaires before the taxpayers of our country funded the COVID-19 vaccine.This type of profiteering and excessive CEO compensation is exactly what the American people are sick and tired of. And that is why, this morning, I will be asking Moderna to reconsider their decision to quadruple the price of this vaccine and not raise the price at all.Let me mention that after this hearing was announced, Moderna pledged that its “vaccines and boosters will continue to be available at no cost for the vast majority of people in the United States” through the creation of a patient assistance program. That is good news.The bad news is that most patient assistance programs are poorly designed and are extremely difficult, if not impossible, for patients to access. Our committee looks forward to working with Moderna to develop a program that allows every American to continue to receive the COVID vaccine for free without the need to file complicated forms or paperwork, answer personal questions or wait for hours on end at the pharmacy. In other words, let us truly make this vaccine available for free to all Americans.Let me conclude by posing a moral question that I hope this committee will address in the weeks and months to come. And that is, above and beyond the COVID vaccine should people in America and around the world be allowed to get sicker and sometimes die because they cannot afford the outrageous and arbitrary prices that the pharmaceutical industry demands?Do we not need to change the current culture of greed into a culture which understands that science and medical breakthroughs should work for ordinary people, and not just enrich large corporations and CEOs? And, in that respect, it is important to remember the contributions of great scientists like Dr. Jonas Salk who, in the 1950s, invented the vaccine for polio. Salk’s work saved millions of lives and prevented millions more from being paralyzed.It has been estimated that if Dr. Salk had chosen to patent the polio vaccine he would have made billions of dollars. But he did not.When asked who owns the patent to this vaccine Dr. Salk said: “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?”What Dr. Salk understood was that the purpose of the vaccine he invented was to save lives, not to make himself obscenely rich.In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a scientist from Scotland, discovered penicillin at St. Mary’s hospital in London. Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the medical world and saved millions of lives.When Fleming was asked about his role, he did not talk about the outrageous fortune he could have made through his discovery. Instead, he said: “I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.” He refused to make obscene profits from his discovery.In 1921, Dr. Frederick Banting along with two other scientists at the University of Toronto invented insulin. An issue we’re hearing a lot about today.When Dr. Banting was asked why he wouldn’t patent insulin and why he sold the rights to insulin for just $1 he replied: “Insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.”It has been estimated that Dr. Banting’s invention saved some 300 million lives.Once again, a great scientist made it clear that his purpose in life was to ease suffering and save human lives, not to make billions for himself.In this moment of excessive corporate greed, the moral vision of these great scientists is something that we might learn from.Ranking Member Cassidy, you are recognized for your opening statement.

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 21 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday issued the following statement after the administration rejected a march-in rights petition to lower the price of a vital cancer drug:

“I am extremely disappointed that the Biden Administration denied a petition by prostate cancer patients to substantially reduce the price of Xtandi. This is a drug that was invented with taxpayer dollars by scientists at UCLA and can be purchased in Canada for one-fifth the U.S. price. The Japanese drugmaker Astellas, which made $1 billion in profits in 2021, has raised the price of this drug by more than 75 percent to over $166,000 per year. How many prostate cancer patients will die because they cannot afford this unacceptable price? As the chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I will do everything I can to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and make sure that drugs that are developed with U.S. taxpayer money are sold here at a reasonable price.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Silicon Valley Bank
Date: March 12, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., March 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Sunday issued the following statement on Silicon Valley Bank:

“Let’s be clear. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a direct result of an absurd 2018 bank deregulation bill signed by Donald Trump that I strongly opposed. Five years ago, the Republican Director of the Congressional Budget Office released a report finding that this legislation would ‘increase the likelihood that a large financial firm with assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would fail.’

“Unfortunately, that is precisely what happened. During the debate over the legislation I said: ‘Are our memories so short that we learned nothing from the 2008 Wall Street crash? Have we learned nothing from the Savings and Loan disaster of the early 1990s or the thievery of Wells Fargo over the last couple of years or the dishonesty of Equifax or the accounting fraud at Enron and Arthur Anderson or the failure of Long-Term Capital Management or the billions of dollars in fines that financial institution after financial institution has paid out for illegal or deceptive activities?’ Sadly, the Republican Congress and the Trump Administration answered all of these questions with a resounding NO.

“Now is not the time for U.S. taxpayers to bail out Silicon Valley Bank. If there is a bailout of Silicon Valley Bank, it must be 100 percent financed by Wall Street and large financial institutions. We cannot continue down the road of more socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else. Let us have the courage to stand up to Wall Street, repeal the disastrous 2018 bank deregulation law, break up too big to fail banks and address the needs of working families, not the risky bets of vulture capitalists.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Address Teacher Pay Crisis in America
Date: March 9, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 9 – As school districts across the country report serious staffing shortages largely due to unprecedented levels of stress, burnout, and low pay, Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Thursday introduced essential legislation to begin to address the major teacher pay crisis in America and ensure that all public school teachers earn a livable and competitive wage that is at least $60,000 a year and increases over the course of their career.“It is simply unacceptable that, in the richest country in the history of the world, many teachers are having to work two or three extra jobs just to make ends meet,” said Sanders. “The situation has become so absurd that the top 15 hedge fund managers on Wall Street make more money in a single year than every kindergarten teacher in America combined – over 120,000 teachers. Wages for public school teachers are so low that in 36 states, the average public school teacher with a family of four qualifies for food stamps, public housing and other government assistance programs. We have got to do better than that. It is time to end the international embarrassment of America ranking 29th out of 30 countries in pay for middle school teachers. If we are going to have the best public school system in the world, we have got to radically change our attitude toward education and make sure that every teacher in America receives the compensation that they deserve for the enormously important and difficult work that they do. No public school teacher in America should make less than $60,000 a year.”Joining Sanders on the Pay Teachers Act are Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).Today in America, more than half of public schools report feeling understaffed, while the starting pay for teachers in nearly 40 percent of school districts is less than $40,000 a year. Forty-three percent of all public school teachers make less than $60,000 a year and hundreds of thousands of public school teachers have to work two or three jobs during the school year to make ends meet. Meanwhile, the average weekly wage of a public school teacher has been stagnate for the past 50 years, increasing by only $29 over the last three decades, after adjusting for inflation.The pandemic only made things worse for educators, with the historic staffing shortages disproportionately affecting schools primarily serving students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. Recent studies show that, of all workers, K-12 public school teachers were the most likely to report higher levels of anxiety, stress, and burnout during the pandemic. Today, 44 percent of public school teachers quit the profession within five years.In addition to requiring that states establish a minimum teacher’s salary of $60,000 a year and pay all teachers a livable and competitive salary that increases as experience and responsibilities grow, the Pay Teachers Act would significantly increase federal investments in teachers and public schools, including tripling Title I-A funding and funding for rural education programs, diversifying and expanding the teacher pipeline, and strengthening leadership and advancement opportunities for educators.“Students of every color, background and ZIP code deserve qualified and caring educators who are dedicated and have the resources to uncover the passions and potential of every child,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “America’s schools are facing a five-alarm crisis because of the educator shortages that have been decades in the making and exacerbated by the pandemic. Together, we must recruit large numbers of diverse educators into the profession and retain qualified and experienced educators in our schools to support our students in learning recovery and thriving in today’s world. To do that, we must have competitive career-based pay to recruit and retain educators. On behalf of the 3 million members of the National Education Association, I thank Chairman Sanders for introducing the Teacher Pay Act that would ensure a $60,000 starting salary for every teacher as a critical first step to ensure all our students have the committed educators they need to thrive. We urge Senators to support educators and cosponsor this common-sense legislation that invests in our students, educators, and public schools.”“Educators are nation builders. They have a vital role in educating and caring for our next generation. But they are neither treated nor paid commensurate with that role. Teachers earn nearly 24 percent less than similarly educated professionals, and when adjusted for inflation, many earning less than they were making a decade ago,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Even with their need to take second jobs, educators spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on supplies, snacks, books and other items for students. Chairman Bernie Sanders’s bill, the Pay Teachers Act, will help close the pay gap by significantly increasing federal investments in public schools and raising annual teacher salaries to at least $60,000—and providing increases throughout teachers’ careers—to help ensure teachers are paid a livable and competitive salary. It would also diversify and expand the teacher pipeline and leadership opportunities. This is a necessary federal investment to help sustain the teaching profession, and sustaining the teaching profession will directly help us provide greater opportunities to our students.”The Pay Teachers Act also garnered the support of more than 50 major organizations, including American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, Alliance for Quality Education, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, Center for Black Educator Development, Council for Exceptional Children, Economic Policy Institute, Education Leaders of Color, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, Latinos for Education, National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, National Rural Education Association, National Women’s Law Center, New Leaders, Rural School and Community Trust, The Education Trust, The Teacher Salary Project, and TNTP.Read the bill text,here.Read the bill section-by-section,here.Read the bill fact sheet,here.

Title: NEWS: Following Successful Public Pressure Campaign to Lower the Cost of Eli Lilly’s Insulin, Sanders and Bush Introduce Bill to Finish the Job and Cap the Price at $20 Per Vial
Date: March 9, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) on Thursday introduced legislation that would cap the list price of insulin at no more than $20 per vial, substantially reducing the cost of the lifesaving drug for the more than 7 million people who use insulin across the United States and the 1.3 million Americans who were forced to ration insulin last year.“There is no reason why Americans should pay the highest prices in the world for insulin – in some cases, ten times as much as people in other countries,” said Sen. Sanders. “In 1923, the inventors of insulin sold their patents for $1 to save lives, not to turn pharmaceutical executives into billionaires. Now, 100 years later, unacceptable corporate greed has caused the price of this lifesaving medication to skyrocket by over 1,000 percent since 1996. We can no longer tolerate a rigged health care system that forced 1.3 million people with diabetes to ration insulin while the three major insulin manufacturers made $21 billion dollars in profits. Now is the time for Congress to take on the greed and power of the pharmaceutical industry and substantially lower the price of insulin. In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should die because they cannot afford the medication they need.”“As a nurse, I’ve seen too many people in our communities struggle to afford their life-saving insulin medication. People are left choosing between insulin or groceries; insulin or rent; insulin or child care. This is unacceptable,” said Congresswoman Bush. “That is why I am so proud to join Senator Sanders in introducing the Insulin for All Act, legislation that will effectively cap the price of insulin at $20 per vial. We cannot solely rely on the whims of pharmaceutical companies to set standards of patient care and determine who can afford medication. Congress must act swiftly to remove the costly burden of insulin for patients with diabetes and save lives.”While Eli Lilly and Company, after significant public pressure, recentlyannounceda 70 percent price cut for Humalog, the company has not yet moved to reduce the price of other insulin products. Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – which along with Eli Lilly make up 90 percent of the insulin market in the U.S. – have not made any commitment to lower their prices at all. When Eli Lilly first launched Humalog in 1996, it set the price close to $20.Joining Sanders and Bush on the Insulin for All Act of 2023 are Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas), Al Green (D-Texas), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).“Big Pharma continues to rake in record profits by gouging patients on insulin prices,” said Sen. Merkley. “Unaffordable high prices are forcing patients to ration their insulin, leading to dire health consequences – heart attacks, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, foot disease and amputations, even death. It’s tragic, it’s unacceptable, and it’s time to end this rip-off. No one should have to go bankrupt just to afford the daily medication they need to stay healthy. It’s time to put people above profits, and tell the big drug companies that their days extorting Americans who need insulin to survive are over.”“I am proud of capping insulin copays at $35 for Medicare recipients as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, but the work doesn’t stop there. Corporate profit shouldn’t dictate access to vital health care,” said Sen. Markey. “Guaranteeing affordable insulin for all won’t just lessen the burden that is the sky-high cost of health care in this country — it’ll save lives, keep people out of the emergency room, and ensure the seven million Americans who rely on insulin have access to the medicine they need.”While researchers estimate that a vial of insulin costs just $8 to manufacture, the price of insulin has gone up by over 1,000 percent since 1996. Sanofi’s Lantus costs $292 per vial. Novo Nordisk’s Novolog is listed at $289. Eli Lilly’s Lyumjev can be purchased for $275. People with diabetes face nearly $17,000 per year in medical expenses, more than half of which is directly attributable to their diabetes, and health care for people with diabetes accounts for one in four health care dollars in the U.S.In 2019, Sanders took a busload of people with diabetes from Michigan to Canada, where they were able to purchase the same insulin products that they bought in the U.S. for one-tenth the price. Earlier this month, Sanderssent letterscalling on Sanofi and Novo Nordisk to follow Eli Lilly in reducing the price of insulin.The Insulin for All Act of 2023 also garnered the support of more than 70 major organizations, including: T1International, The Insulin Initiative, The Diabetes Link, Mutual Aid Diabetes, Social Security Works, Public Citizen, Center for Popular Democracy, People’s Action, American Federation of Teachers, American Medical Student Association, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, National Domestic Workers Alliance, United Mine Workers of America, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Doctors for America, Indivisible, and MoveOn.Read the bill text,here.Read the bill summary,here.Read the full list of supporting organizations,here.

WASHINGTON, March 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) issued the following statement after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz agreed to testify before the committee on Wednesday, March 29:“I’m happy to announce that Howard Schultz, the CEO and founder of Starbucks, has finally agreed to testify before the Senate HELP Committee. The HELP Committee was scheduled to vote tomorrow to subpoena him and I want to thank the members of the Committee who, in a bi-partisan way, were prepared to do just that.“Let’s be clear. In America, workers have the constitutional right to organize unions and engage in collective bargaining to improve their wages and working conditions. Unfortunately Starbucks, under Mr. Schultz’s leadership, has done everything possible to prevent that from happening.“The National Labor Relations Board has issued over 80 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor law and an Administrative Law Judge in New York recently ruled that Starbucks has engaged in ‘egregious and widespread misconduct’ in a union organizing campaign that started in 2019. Despite the fact that over 280 Starbucks coffee shops have successfully voted to form a union over the past year, Starbucks has refused to negotiate in good faith to sign a single first contract with their employees.“The HELP Committee intends to make clear that in America we must not have a two-tiered justice system in which billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity, while working class people are held accountable for their actions. I look forward to hearing from Mr. Schultz as to when he intends to end his illegal anti-union activities and begin signing fair first contracts with the unions.”

“At a time when unions are more popular than they have been in decades, we have got to make it easier for workers to exercise their constitutional right to form a union and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions,” said Sanders. “The American people are sick and tired of the unprecedented corporate greed and illegal union busting that is taking place throughout this country.

Title: NEWS: Following Starbucks’ Response to Subpoena Vote, Sanders Reiterates Request for CEO Schultz to Testify
Date: March 2, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 2 – Following Starbucks’ response today to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee’s upcoming vote on a subpoena for CEO Howard Schultz to testify on the coffee giant’s lack of compliance with federal labor law, Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent the following letter to the company reiterating the committee’s request for Schultz to appear.The full text of the letter from Sanders ishereand below:Zabrina JenkinsActing Executive Vice Presidentand General CounselStarbucks Corporation2401 Utah Avenue SouthSeattle, Washington 98134March 2, 2023Dear Ms. Jenkins:Thank you very much for the letter you sent to me today. Unfortunately, your letter does not address any of the serious concerns that I and many other United States Senators have raised for nearly a year.Quite frankly, I am shocked and deeply concerned that Howard Schultz would continue to defy a request made by a majority of members on the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) to testify about the 80 complaints issued by the National Labor Relations Board against Starbucks for violating federal labor law, the more than 500 unfair labor practice charges lodged against Starbucks and the illegal firing of more than a dozen Starbucks workers.Let’s be clear. Howard Schultz is the founder of Starbucks, he is the CEO of Starbucks, he is the spokesperson of Starbucks, and he will continue to be on the Board of Directors at Starbucks well into the future. In numerous media interviews, Mr. Schultz has made it clear that he is the driving force of labor policy at Starbucks.For these reasons, the Senate HELP Committee invited Howard Schultz to testify, not a subordinate, because he is the man who engineered and continues to make labor decisions at Starbucks.As you are no doubt are aware, just yesterday, an Administrative Law Judge, issued a some 200-page ruling in which he made clear that under Howard Schultz, Starbucks has massively and egregiously violated federal labor law, ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven workers that were wrongfully terminated and to re-open a store in Buffalo that was illegally shut down, among many other things. In addition, this judge ordered Howard Schultz to read a notice to Starbucks employees about their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and to assure that Starbucks will not infringe upon these rights.Perhaps most significantly, this judge detailed a November 2021 meeting—before Mr. Schultz had even returned to the company as CEO—that he had with all Buffalo-area Starbucks workers. These workers were forced to attend this meeting while every Buffalo-area store was closed to listen to Mr. Schultz one month prior to union elections that were held in the area. This meeting makes clear the enormous power and influence Mr. Schultz has over labor policy at Starbucks even when he is not the official CEO of the company.The American people are sick and tired of multi-national corporations violating labor laws with impunity. Howard Schultz may be a multi-billionaire, but he has got to understand that he and the multi-billion-dollar corporation he runs are not above the law.The HELP Committee will vote on March 8th at 10 a.m. to compel Mr. Schultz to testify and to investigate violations of labor law at major corporations. At some point in the future, we may well want to hear from other executives as to how Starbucks intends to abide by the law and allow workers to form unions. But right now, the immediate issue is to hear from Mr. Schultz.Sincerely,Bernard SandersChairman, Senate HELP Committee

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), announced Monday that the panel will hold a hearing this Thursday, March 2, at 10 a.m. ET titled, “Community Health Centers: Saving Lives, Saving Money.”Today, 30 million men, women, and children – including nearly 400,000 veterans – receive high quality primary health care at community health centers in 14,000 neighborhoods throughout the United States. In Sanders’ home state of Vermont, nearly one out of every three people are now receiving their primary health care through a community health center across 73 sites – the highest per-capita use of community health centers in the country. Community health centers currently receive about $5.8 billion a year in federal funding, but this funding will expire on September 30, 2023 creating a primary care cliff that Congress can and must avoid.“In America today, community health centers are providing cost-effective primary medical care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs to 30 million people regardless of a person’s bank account or insurance status,” Sanders said. “Not only do these health centers save lives and ease human suffering, they save Medicare, Medicaid, and our entire health care system billions of dollars each year because they avoid the need to go to expensive emergency rooms and hospitals. In the midst of a broken and dysfunctional health care system, I will be doing everything I can to expand community health centers so that every American has access to the primary care that they need and deserve.”According to the most recent data, nearly 100 million Americans live in a primary care desert, nearly 70 million live in a dental care desert, and some 158 million Americans – nearly half the country’s population – live in a mental health care desert. Today, 85 million people are uninsured or under-insured, over 500,000 people go bankrupt each year because of medically related debt, and more than 68,000 people die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need. Expanding community health centers will begin to address this urgent crisis.Testifying at the hearing will be Amanda Pears Kelly, Chief Executive Officer of Advocates for Community Health and Executive Director of the Association of Clinicians for the Underserved; Ben Harvey, M.A., Chief Executive Officer of Indiana Primary Health Care Association; Robert S. Nocon, M.H.S., Ph.D., Assistant Professor at Kaiser Permanente Bernard J.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Welch, Balint Demand Answers from Postal Service Leadership on Postal Delays in Hinesburg and Across Vermont
Date: February 17, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) on Thursday sent two letters to the leadership of the United States Postal Service (USPS) demanding answers and accountability regarding postal issues affecting workers and service in communities across Vermont. These letters – one to the USPS Board of Governors and one to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy – were the first sent by the newly-formed Vermont Delegation in the 118th Congress, continuing ongoing delegation efforts to resolve postal issues across the state.“We write with great concern regarding the ongoing staffing crisis and resulting mail delays at United States Postal Service locations across Vermont,” the delegation wrote in both letters to USPS leadership. “In the last month alone, we have received a particularly high volume of calls from the Chittenden County town of Hinesburg about insufficient staffing that has resulted in poor customer service. We have heard similar concerning reports from post offices in Williston, South Burlington, and Windham County. These issues are unacceptable; our constituents deserve better.”The delegation laid out urgent requests for action, assessments, and recommendations. The letters include questions and requests for information covering a wide range of issues, including an immediate plan of action to fix the egregious postal issues in Hinesburg, improvements to USPS’ hiring process, and actions to address postal workers’ needs, delays in mail delivery, leadership deficiencies, and holiday performance. The delegation requested answers by no later than March 1, 2023.In the letters, Sanders, Welch, and Balint described serious reports of mail delays that have lasted multiple weeks, local businesses and individuals that have missed bill payments, and even older Vermonters who have been forced to order emergency prescription replacements because their original medication never arrived or arrived in unusable condition. The delegation has also heard from numerous constituents whose regular mail was significantly delayed due to the prioritization of third-party packages, including from Amazon. “This is an outrage,” they wrote.To the Board of Governors, the delegation wrote: “For years, our Vermont Congressional Delegation has engaged with Postmaster General DeJoy and regional Postal Service leadership in an attempt to address mail delays and staffing issues, yet no help has come. Vermonters understand what we know to be true: passing the Postal Service Reform Act was critical in ensuring the Postal Service has the financial footing necessary to adequately staff the agency and restore delivery service. We, along with our constituents, expect meaningful progress.”To Postmaster DeJoy, the delegation wrote: “As Postmaster General, you are responsible for the timely delivery of the mail. As the Vermont Delegation noted in our December 2021 letter to you, when you fail in that mission you fail Vermont’s seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, and small business owners… We have made our and our constituents’ frustrations regarding your leadership failures clear. The U.S. Postal Service is a critical government agency, not a money-making machine. We expect you to take these staffing issues in Vermont and across the country seriously, and to focus on meeting the Postal Service’s duties to the American people.”Read the delegation letter to the USPS Board of Governors,here.Read the delegation letter to Postmaster General DeJoy,here.Read past delegation letters to Postmaster DeJoy, in 2020 and 2021,here.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Holds HELP Committee Hearing on the Health Care Workforce Crisis in America
Date: February 16, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today led a committee hearing titled, “Examining Health Care Workforce Shortages: Where Do We Go From Here?”Sanders’ opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will come to order.Today we are holding a hearing to examine the healthcare workforce challenges that our country faces. I will give an opening statement, followed by Ranking Member Cassidy, and then we will introduce the witnesses.After the witnesses give their testimony, Senators will each have five minutes to question the witnesses.Let me begin by thanking Ranking Member Cassidy, all Senators and the panelists for being with us today to discuss this enormously important issue.It’s no secret that our country faces many health care crises. Despite spending almost twice as much per capita as almost any other major country on healthcare – nearly $13,000 for every man, woman and child – 85 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, over 500,000 Americans go bankrupt each year because of medically related debt, and we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.It is my expectation that over the next many months our committee will address all of these healthcare issues and more.But today, we’re going to focus on another major healthcare crisis and that is, despite all of our healthcare spending, we don’t have enough doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, dental hygienists, pharmacists, mental health providers, and other medical professionals.And what is the impact of those health provider shortages? It means that nearly 100 million of our people live in a primary care desert where they are unable to gain timely access to a doctor when they need it. It means that nearly 70 million live in a dental care desert, unable to get dental care while teeth are rotting in their mouths. And it means that some 158 million Americans – nearly half the population – live in a mental health care desert at a time when this country is facing a major crisis in mental health.Simply put, it means that a significant percentage of our population live in places where they cannot access the healthcare they desperately need.In my view, this reality is a contributing factor to the declining life expectancy we are seeing in many parts of our country, and the fact that our overall life expectancy is significantly lower than many other industrialized countries. Life expectancy is not simply a factor of healthcare access, but it is an important factor. If people do not get to a doctor when they should, if they cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe they will die earlier than they should and suffer unnecessary, debilitating pain.And here is a point that you are going to hear me make very often. And that is not only does the lack of medical professionals in many parts of the country lead to increased human suffering and unnecessary death, it is incredibly wasteful from a financial perspective. If people cannot access a primary care doctor, they may end up in an emergency room which is the most expensive form of primary healthcare. And if their illnesses continue to go untreated, they may end up in a hospital and could run up bills of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Study after study shows that disease prevention saves money. If people are able to access care when they need it; if there are enough medical professionals to provide that care in every part of this country, our healthcare costs will go down.A shortage of healthcare personnel was a problem before the pandemic and now it has gotten worse. Health care jobs have gotten more challenging and, in some cases, more dangerous. Many thousands of health care workers have died from COVID taking care of the American people, and many more have become sick.According to the best estimates, over the next decade, our country faces a shortage of over 120,000 doctors – including a huge shortage of primary care doctors.Over the next two years, it is estimated that we will need up to 450,000 more nurses.Today, it is estimated that we need about 100,000 more dentists – right now.And in America today, there is a massive shortage – many, many hundreds of thousands – of mental health service providers – psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, addiction specialists and many more.In addition to our overall crisis in healthcare providers that problem is especially acute in minority communities. We desperately need more African American, Latino, and Native American healthcare personnel who are way under-represented in the healthcare profession.How we address these crises is the subject of today’s hearing and of a lot more future discussions. But talk and hearings are not good enough. The American people want this committee to produce some serious legislation that address these crises, and that is exactly what we must do. Let me say a few words on what I believe to be some of the obvious steps forwards as we grapple with this issue.First, it is a no brainer to understand that, when over 10,000 medical school graduates are unable to find residency slots every year, we must significantly expand and improve the Graduate Medical Education program. Further, and in the jurisdiction of this committee, we must also greatly expand the Teaching Health Center program which will allow us to grow significantly the number of primary care physicians and nurses we desperately need.At a time when young people are graduating from medical school, dental school, and nursing school, deeply in debt – sometimes to the tune of $400,000 or $500,000 – it is pretty obvious that those graduates are not going to practice in under-served areas where they will earn less money than those who practice in more affluent communities. That is why we must substantially increase student loan debt forgiveness and scholarships that the National Health Service Corps program provides. We have expanded that program in recent years, for doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health providers, but much more needs to be done.Further, in terms of nursing, despite a major nursing shortage, we have the absurd situation that in many parts of this country, including Vermont, nursing schools are rejecting applicants because they don’t have the nurse educators and facilities they need.In Vermont, as an example, nurse educators earn about $65,000 a year – nearly half of what nurses with similar degrees earn working in a hospital. We need to make sure that nursing schools throughout the country have the staffing and facilities to educate the number of new nurses that we will need. In my view, that means we also need to substantially expand and reform, the Nurse Corps and the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, among many other programs.And let’s be clear – the issues we are talking about today are just part of the problem. Our committee must also grapple with broader health care workforce challenges. Pharmacies across the country are having trouble hiring pharmacists. We don’t have enough home healthcare workers. We don’t have enough nursing home staff, etc., etc.Further, this crisis also extends to emergency medical services (EMS) and our first responders. These heroic workers are often the first people there during someone’s most difficult moments, and often are the difference between life and death. And yet, in rural parts of Vermont and throughout this country, EMS workers are often volunteers or underpaid professionals.I now recognize Ranking Member Cassidy for his opening remarks.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Delivers Speech on Floor of the Senate on the Greed of the Pharmaceutical Industry
Date: February 15, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 – Following thenewsthat the CEO of Moderna will accept an invitation to testify in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee next month, Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) gave remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the growth of greed in the pharmaceutical industry and what Congress can do to end it.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:M. President: There is a lot of discussion about how “divided” our nation is and, on many issues, that is absolutely true.But on one of the most important matters facing our country the American people – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, and Conservatives – could not be more united.And that is the need to take on the unprecedented corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry and to substantially lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs.Today, millions of Americans are making the unacceptable choice between feeding their families or buying the medicine they need. Seniors from Vermont to Alaska are forced to split their pills in half and many have died because they did not have enough money to fill their prescriptions.No one knows for sure precisely how many people die because they cannot afford to buy their prescription drugs.But a 2020 study by West Health found that by the year 2030, over 100,000 Medicare recipients could die prematurely each and every year because they cannot afford to buy their life-saving medicine.M. President: All over this country, the American people are asking the following questions:How does it happen that people in the United States pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?Why is it that nearly one out of every four Americans cannot afford their prescription medication?How does it happen that nearly half of all new drugs in the United States cost more than $150,000 a year?M. President: A few years ago, I took a busload of people with diabetes from Detroit, Michigan, to a drugstore in Windsor, Ontario. And there, in Canada, they were able to purchase the same insulin products they bought in the United States for one-tenth the price.In 1999, 24 years ago, I took another busload of people – this time women with breast cancer — from St. Albans, Vermont to a doctor’s office and a pharmacy in Montreal, Canada. And, there again, with tears in their eyes, they were able to purchase tamoxifen for one-tenth of the price charged in the United States.M. President: How is it that in Canada and other major countries the same medications manufactured by the same companies, sold in the same bottles are available for a fraction of the price that we pay in the United States?Well, the answers to all of these questions are not complicated. In fact, they can be summed up in just three words: Unacceptable corporate greed.M. President: Over the past 25 years, the pharmaceutical industry has spent $8.5 billion on lobbying and over $745 million on campaign contributions to get Congress to do its bidding.Incredibly, last year, drug companies hired over 1,700 lobbyists including the former congressional leaders of both major political parties – over 3 pharmaceutical industry lobbyists for every Member of Congress.Meanwhile, as Americans die because they cannot afford the medications they need, the pharmaceutical industry makes much higher profit margins than other major industries. Between the years 2000-2018, drug companies in this country made $8.6 trillion dollars in profits.In fact, in 2021, just ten pharmaceutical companies in the United States – AbbVie, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Merck, Moderna, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead Sciences, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals – made a total of more than $102 billion in profits up 137 percent from the previous year.But it’s not just industry profits. It is the exorbitant compensation packages that the pharmaceutical industry has given to its CEOs and other executives within the industry.According to a report done by the HELP Committee staff released today in 2021, while hundreds of thousands of Americans died from COVID, 50 pharmaceutical executives in just 10 companies made $1.9 billion in total compensation.These same 50 executives are in line to receive up to $2.8 billion in golden parachutes once they leave their companies.For example, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez’s made nearly $62 million in total compensation – in one year.The CEO of Eli Lilly, David Ricks, made more than $67 million – in one year.Incredibly, the CEO of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Leonard Schleifer, made nearly $453 million in total compensation – in one year.Meanwhile, M. President, while we are told over and over again that the reason we have outrageously high drug prices in America is because of the need to invest in research and development, it turns out that, over the past decade, 14 major pharmaceutical companies spent $747 billion not to research and develop life-saving drugs, but to make their wealthy shareholders even wealthier by buying back their own stock and handing out huge dividends. It turns out that the drug companies spent $87 billion more on stock buybacks and dividends than what they spent on research and development. Let me repeat that. Drug companies spent $87 billion more on stock buybacks and dividends than on research and development.M. President: The truth is we are dealing here today not just with an economic issue in terms of the high cost of prescription drugs. We are dealing with a profound moral issue and that is: Is it morally acceptable that tens of thousands of people die each year because they cannot afford the medicine their doctors prescribe – while the industry makes billions in profits and provides their CEOs with outrageous compensation packages?Is it morally acceptable that, at a time when, the taxpayers of this country spent tens of billions a year on the research and development of life-saving drugs, that many of these same taxpayers are unable to afford the drugs they helped develop?Is it morally acceptable that the business model of the pharmaceutical industry today is not to create the life-saving drugs we need for cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, diabetes, and so many other terrible illnesses, but through excessive greed in order to make as much money as they can?M. President: It has not always been that way. There was once a time when the inventors of life-saving drugs were not obsessed with making huge sums of money, but were instead obsessed with ending the terrible illnesses that plagued humanity.In the 1950s, for example, there was Dr. Jonas Salk, who invented the vaccine for polio. Salk’s work saved millions of lives and prevented millions more from being paralyzed.It has been estimated that if Dr. Salk had chosen to patent the polio vaccine he would have made billions of dollars. But he did not.When asked who owns the patent to this vaccine this is what Dr. Salk said: “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun”What Dr. Salk understood was that the purpose of this vaccine he invented was to save lives, not to make himself obscenely rich.And he, among great scientists, was not alone.In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a scientist from Scotland, discovered penicillin at St. Mary’s hospital in London. Fleming’s discovery of penicillin changed the medical world and saved millions of lives.I am sure that Alexander Fleming could also have become a multi-billionaire if he chose to own the exclusive rights to this anti-biotic.But he did not.When Fleming was asked about his role, he did not talk about the outrageous fortune he could have made through his discovery. Instead, he said: “I did not invent penicillin. Nature did that. I only discovered it by accident.”And then, M. President, there was the great scientist Frederick Banting from Canada.In 1921, Dr. Banting along with two other scientists at the University of Toronto invented insulin. An issue we’re hearing a lot about today.When Dr. Banting was asked why he wouldn’t patent insulin and why he sold the rights to insulin for just $1 he replied: “Insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.”It has been estimated that Dr. Banting’s invention saved some 300 million lives.Once again, a great scientist made it clear that his purpose in life was to save humanity and save lives, not to make billions for himself.Meanwhile, M. President, while Dr. Banting sold his patent for $1 so that humanity could benefit from his discovery, I should mention that Eli Lilly, one of our nation’s largest drug companies, has increased the price of insulin by 1,200 percent over the past 27 years to $275 – while it costs just $8 to manufacture. Not quite the spirit of Frederick Banting.Now let’s fast forward to the COVID pandemic, this horrible period in our history where we have lost over 1 million Americans and tens of millions have suffered varying levels of illness.Moderna, a drug company in Massachusetts, worked alongside the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine that so many of our people have effectively used. It is widely acknowledged that both the company and the NIH were responsible for the creation of this vaccine.After the company received billions of dollars from the federal government to research, develop and distribute the COVID-vaccine, guess what happened? The CEO of Moderna, Stéphane Bancel, became a billionaire overnight and is now worth $5.7 billion.Further, the 2 co-founders of Moderna (Noubar Afeyan and Robert Langer) also became billionaires and are now both worth $2 billion each. Moreover, one of the founding investors in Moderna (Tim Springer) is worth $2.5 billion.None of them were billionaires before the taxpayers of our country funded the COVID-19 vaccine. And are now collectively worth over $11 billion.Meanwhile, Moderna, as a whole, made over $19 billion in profits during the pandemic.And how is the CEO of this company thanking the taxpayers of this country who are responsible for making him and his colleagues incredibly rich?He is thanking them by proposing to quadruple the price of the COVID vaccine to about $130 once the government stockpile of the vaccine runs out.Let’s be clear: This is a vaccine that costs just $2.85 to manufacture.M. President: On March 22nd, the Senate HELP Committee will be holding a hearing on March 22nd on this subject. Bottom line: Does Moderna think that it is appropriate to quadruple prices for the vaccine after receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer support.M. President: While Moderna may be a poster child for corporate greed, it is not alone.A number of years ago, the former CEO of Gilead became a billionaire by charging $1,000 for Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug that was discovered by scientists at the Veterans Administration. This drug costs just $1 to manufacture and could be purchased in India for $4.The Japanese drugmaker Astellas, which made a billion dollars in profits in 2021, recently raised the price of the prostate cancer drug Xtandi by more than 75% in the United States to nearly $190,000. This is a drug that was invented by federally funded scientists at UCLA and can be purchased in Canada for one-sixth the US price.M. President: It does not have to be this way. The reality is that if Congress had the courage to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, we could cut the price of prescription drugs in America by at least 50%.How? By preventing the pharmaceutical industry from charging more for prescription drugs in the U.S. than they do in Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Japan – a concept that is not only supported by progressives, but former President Donald Trump.M. President: There is no rational reason why the HIV treatment Biktarvy costs over $45,000 per year in the U.S, but only $7,500 in France.Or why a weekly dose of the auto-immune medicine Enbrel costs over $1,760 in the U.S, but just $300 in Canada.Or why a vial of insulin costs $98.70 in the U.S, but just $11 in Germany.Or why a monthly course of the blood thinner Eliquis costs $440 in the U.S., but just $102 in Spain.Or why an injection of the breast cancer treatment Herceptin costs nearly $7,000 in the U.S, but less than $1,600 in Switzerland.Or why a bottle of a hepatitis C drug costs over $30,000 in the U.S, but just $15,000 in Greece.M. President: The American people whether they are Republicans, Democrats or Independents, whether they are conservatives, moderates or progressives, are sick and tired of being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry.Now is the time for us to take on the greed and power of that industry and substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, today issued the following statement after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz refused to appear in front of the committee to testify about his company’s long-running noncompliance with federal labor law:“It is disappointing, but not surprising, that Howard Schultz, the CEO and director of Starbucks has declined an invitation from a majority of members on the HELP Committee to testify at a U.S. Senate hearing to answer why the National Labor Relations Board has lodged over 75 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor laws. Apparently, it is easier for Mr. Schultz to fire workers who are exercising their constitutional right to form unions, and to intimidate others who may be interested in joining a union than to answer questions from elected officials. If Mr. Schultz believes that a multi-billion dollar corporation like Starbucks can break federal labor law with impunity he is mistaken. As the Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, I intend to hold Mr. Schultz and Starbucks accountable for their unacceptable behavior and look forward to seeing him before our committee.”Before the Februaryinvitation, extended to Schultz by Sanders and every Democratic member of the HELP Committee, Sanders had sent three letters to Schultz in the last year calling on the CEO to end the egregious union-busting campaign the company has deployed against its own workers. The company has yet to provide the documents requested in the most recentletterSanders sent in January 2023.Since the first store voted to unionize in December of 2021 in Buffalo, workers at more than 350 Starbucks in nearly 40 states across the country have held votes to unionize, citing various concerns – from safer working conditions during the pandemic and better wages, to better benefits and more reliable schedules.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Hosts Town Hall on Teacher Pay Crisis in America
Date: February 13, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on Monday hosted a town hall at the U.S. Capitol entitled “Respecting our Teachers: A Town Hall on the Teacher Pay Crisis in America.” He was joined by Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association (NEA), and Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), as well as other educators and teachers.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.

Good evening.  As the new Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, let me thank all of you who are here at the Capitol Visitor’s Center tonight and the many tens of thousands who are watching all over this country as we discuss one of the most important issues facing our nation: The teacher pay crisis in America.

I am delighted to be joined onstage with Becky Pringle, the president of the nation’s largest labor union in America – the National Education Association – representing 3 million educators and their allies throughout our country.  Becky has over 30 years of classroom experience as a middle school teacher from Philadelphia.

I am also delighted to be here with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who represents 1.7 million members in over 3,000 local affiliates all over America.

And let me also thank my good friend Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts – a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for also joining us here today as well.

In a moment, we will hear directly from not only Becky, Randi and Ed, but also from 4 public school teachers from across the country who will share their stories about what’s going on with education today and what teaching has been like during the pandemic.

Let me begin by saying to our nation’s teachers: Thank you.  Thank you for the extraordinarily important work that you are doing every day to improve the lives of our kids. You are true heroes and heroines of our country.  And it is about time that you are treated with the respect and the dignity that you deserve.

It’s also about time that we got our national priorities right.  If we understand that the children of our country are our future then we understand that we should not have the highest childhood poverty of almost any major nation on earth.

If we understand that we live in a competitive global economy and that we need the best educated workforce in the world, we must understand that it is absurd that there are school districts throughout the country where there are major shortages of teachers.

And if we understand the enormously important work that teachers do, that means, in my view, among many other things, that we should be paying public school teachers a minimum of at least $60,000 a year – and I will soon be introducing legislation to do just that.

As all of you here today know, teachers today are experiencing high levels of stress and burnout all of which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.  In fact, new data from the EdWeek Research Center shows that almost 20% of teachers, principals, and district leaders have indicated that they have contracted long COVID and are still suffering from that disease.

The result of all of this: Some 300,000 public school educators and staff left their jobs during the pandemic and we now have a shortage of some 200,000 public school teachers throughout the country.

In America today, over half of our public schools are under-staffed.  And to make matters even worse, these teacher shortages disproportionately impact schools that primarily serve students of color and students in low-income neighborhoods.

In America today, 44% of public school teachers quit the profession within 5 years. Why is that?  Why are so many public school teachers leaving the profession they love? Well, there are many reasons. But one of the primary reasons is the pathetically low pay teachers receive. In America today, the starting pay for teachers in almost 40% of our school districts is less than $40,000 a year.

Further, 43% of all teachers in America make less than $60,000 a year. The situation has become so absurd that the top 15 hedge fund managers on Wall Street make more money in a single year than every kindergarten teacher in America – over 120,000 teachers. The sad reality is that teacher pay in America has been stagnant for nearly 50 years. Unfortunately and unacceptably, the average weekly wage of a public school teacher has gone up by just $29 over the past 30 years – after adjusting for inflation. Wages for public school teachers are so low that in 36 states throughout America, the average public school teacher with a family of four qualifies for food stamps, public housing and other government benefits.  That is simply disgraceful.

In America today, hundreds of thousands of public school teachers are forced to work two or three jobs during the school year.  Maybe they are driving an Uber.  Maybe they are waiting tables.  Maybe they are parking cars.

In the richest country in the history of the world, we have got to do better than that.  It is time to end the international embarrassment of America ranking 29th out of 30 countries in the pay middle school teachers receive.

If we are going to have the best public school system in the world, we have got to radically change our attitude toward education and make sure that every teacher in America receives the compensation that she or he deserves for the enormously important and difficult work that they do.

And let’s be clear.  As bad as public school teachers are paid, childcare workers are paid even less.  What psychologists tell us is that ages 0-4 are the most important years of human development.  In America today, the average childcare worker makes about $13.30 an hour – less than a parking lot attendant or a doggy day care worker.

In my view, there is something fundamentally wrong in America when we pay more to take care of our pets than to take care of our young children.

Let me be frank and tell you what I would like to see. I want the day to come, sooner than later, when we are going to attract the best and brightest young people in our country into teaching. I want those young people to be proud of the profession that they have chosen. I want them to teach in under-served communities and I want them to help produce the best educated kids in the world.

In order to accomplish those goals we have got to pay teachers in America what they deserve. That is why I will soon be introducing the Pay Teachers Act. This bill will triple Title I funding. It will invest in federal programs that support the teaching profession. It will ensure all starting teachers across the country are paid at least $60,000 a year. And it will increase wages for teachers who have made teaching their profession – working on the job for 10, 20, 30 years. This legislation will benefit every public school district in every state in America. Now, I know that some of you are thinking that sounds great. But how are you going to pay for this bill? And I will tell you.  By demanding that the wealthiest people in America – those who inherit over $3.5 million – pay their fair share of taxes.

Legislation that I introduced last Congress to reform the estate tax would raise about $450 billion over the next decade – which is precisely how much the Teacher Pay Act would cost. And it would not increase taxes by one penny on 99.5 percent of Americans who inherit less than $3.5 million.

Let’s be clear: If we can provide over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations, please don’t tell me that we cannot afford to make sure that every teacher in America is paid at least $60,000 a year.

If we could spend $858 billion last year on the military, more than the next 11 nations combined, please don’t tell me that we cannot make sure that every teacher in America is treated with dignity and respect.

Now, here is the good news.  As a result of a strong grassroots movement, led by public school teachers, led by the NEA and the AFT, some states and cities are beginning to move in the right direction.

In recent years, the state of New Mexico has increased teacher pay by an average of 20 percent. Alabama increased teacher pay by 21 percent. And the City of Detroit – a city that has had one of the worst teacher shortages in America – increased the starting salary of teachers to $51,000 this fall – a 33% increase from what they received just six years ago.

Raising teacher salaries to at least $60,000 a year and ensuring competitive pay for all of our teachers is one of the most important steps we can take to address the teacher shortage in America and to improve the quality of our public school system in America.

I look forward to working with all of you to make that a reality.

Title: NEWS: Amid Republican Threats to Social Security, Sanders, Warren, Schakowsky, Hoyle, and Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Increase Benefits and Extend Solvency Through 2096
Date: February 13, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 – As Republicans threaten cuts to Social Security and other essential federal programs, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Val Hoyle (D-Ore.) in the U.S. House of Representatives, introduced legislation that would expand Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year and ensure Social Security is fully funded for the next 75 years – all without raising taxes by one penny on over 93 percent of American households that make $250,000 or less.These estimates reflect an analysis of the legislation conducted by the Social Security Administration at the request of Sen. Sanders. The analysis was also released today in aletterfrom Chief Actuary Stephen Goss.Joining Sanders, Warren, Schakowsky, and Hoyle on the Social Security Expansion Act are Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), as well as 25 cosponsors in the House including Reps. Alma Adams (D-N.C.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Troy A. Carter (D-La.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jesús Chuy García (D-Ill.), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-D.C.), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-N.J.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).“At a time when nearly half of older Americans have no retirement savings and almost 50 percent of our nation’s seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $25,000 a year, our job is not to cut Social Security,” said Sen. Sanders. “Our job is to expand Social Security so that every senior in America can retire with the dignity that they deserve and every person with a disability can live with the security they need. The legislation that we are introducing today will expand Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year and will extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 75 years by making sure that the wealthiest people in our society pay their fair share into the system. Right now, a Wall Street CEO who makes $30 million pays the same amount into Social Security as someone who makes $160,000 a year. Our bill puts an end to that absurdity which will allow us to protect Social Security for generations to come while lifting millions of seniors out of poverty.”“Social Security is an economic lifeline for millions of Americans, but many seniors are struggling with rising costs,” said Sen. Warren. “As House Republicans try to use a manufactured debt ceiling crisis to cut the Social Security that Americans have earned, I’m working with Senator Sanders to expand Social Security and extend its solvency by making the wealthy pay their fair share, so everyone can retire with dignity.”“Social Security lifts more people out of poverty than any other program in the United States. In 2021 alone, Social Security lifted over 18 million seniors out of poverty,” said Rep. Schakowsky. “Instead of working to protect Social Security, my Republican colleagues are plotting to cut benefits and raise the retirement age. I am proud to introduce the Social Security Expansion Act with Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Congresswoman Hoyle, to protect the national treasure that is Social Security. This bill will extend the Social Security trust fund’s solvency and expand benefits so that everyone in America can retire with the security and dignity they deserve after a lifetime of hard work.”“Every American should be able to retire with respect and security by knowing that they will receive the Social Security payments they have earned,” said Rep. Hoyle. “With the rising cost of living, it’s time to modernize and expand the program. I’m proud to co-lead the Social Security Expansion Act, my first bill in Congress, which helps address the disproportionate amount Social Security recipients spend of their income on things like health care and prescription drugs. While House Republicans are willing to put Social Security on the chopping block, we are fighting hard to protect Americans’ hard-earned benefits and expand coverage.”One of the most successful and popular government programs in U.S. history, Social Security has never failed to pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American on time and without delay. Before 1935, when it was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, about 50 percent of the nation’s seniors were living in poverty, as well as countless Americans living with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers. Nearly 90 years later, the senior poverty rate is down to 10.3 percent and in 2021 alone, during the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, Social Security lifted 26.3 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 18 million seniors.Despite this long legacy of combatting poverty, more must be done to strengthen the program, not cut it. While the average Social Security benefit is only $1,688 a month, nearly 40 percent of seniors rely on Social Security for a majority of their income; one in seven rely on it for more than 90 percent of their income; and nearly half of Americans aged 55 and older have no retirement savings at all.By requiring millionaires and billionaires to finally pay their fair share into the program, the Social Security Expansion Act would ensure the fund’s solvency to the end of the century, help low-income workers stay out of poverty by improving the Special Minimum Benefit, restore student benefits up to age 22 for children of disabled or deceased workers, strengthen benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities, increase Cost-Of-Living-Adjustments (COLAs), and expand program benefits across-the-board.The Social Security Expansion Act has also been endorsed by more than 50 major organizations, including: Social Security Works, AFA CWA, AFSCME, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Teachers, American Postal Workers Union, BMWED/IBT, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE), United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, National Education Association, Indivisible, MoveOn, National Domestic Workers Alliance, People’s Action, Public Citizen, Care in Action, CASA, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Center for Popular Democracy, Blue Future, Church World Service, CommonDefense.us, Connecticut Citizen Action Group, Demand Progress, Health Care Awareness Month, Hunger Free America, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Just Care USA, National Partnership for Women & Families, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, NJ State Industrial Union Council, Oregonizers, Our Revolution, Right to Health Action (R2H Action), Sunrise Movement, The National Employment Law Project, Upper West Side Action Group: MoveOn/Indivisible/SwingLeft, Working Families Party, National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC), Indivisible Marin, Children’s Aid, P Street, East New York Farms, Partners for Dignity & Rights, Generations United, Broadway Community, Inc., National Council of Jewish Women, New York State Public Health Association, Justice in Aging, National Women’s Law Center, Americans for Tax Fairness, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Labor Campaign for Single Payer, and American Medical Student Association.Read the bill text,here.Read the fact sheet and full list of supporting organizations,here.Read the Social Security Administration’s analysis of the legislation,here.Read an analysis of what the world’s wealthiest people would pay under this legislation,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement Following Meeting with Brazil’s President Lula
Date: February 10, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday issued the following statement after meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva:

“I enjoyed a productive meeting this morning with President Lula of Brazil and his cabinet. Our countries share many challenges, including the threat of right-wing authoritarians who seek to undermine democratic institutions in both countries. I am very impressed that in his short visit to the United States, Lula chose to speak to the AFL-CIO. In that regard, we discussed ways to build an economy that serves all people, not just the wealthy and large corporations. We also discussed ways to advance workers’ rights and build strong unions.

“Unlike his predecessor, Lula understands the enormous threat that climate change poses to our planet. We discussed ideas of how to increase international cooperation to preserve the environment for future generations. Scientists tell us that deforestation will have a devastating impact on climate change and the planet, and it is imperative that the United States work with Brazil and other countries to protect the Amazon.

“If ever there was a time for international solidarity on these shared challenges, this is it. My hope and expectation is that the United States and Brazil will build a stronger partnership to address these crises.”

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders and All Democratic Members of HELP Committee Invite Starbucks CEO to Testify at Hearing on Company’s Labor Practices
Date: February 8, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 – In a letter signed by all the Democratic members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) on Tuesday invited Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to testify at a hearing in front of the panel on March 9 about the company’s lack of compliance with Federal labor laws.“Please consider this letter an invitation to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) on March 9, 2023,” the senators wrote. “We look forward to seeing you. We greatly appreciate your assistance to the HELP Committee.”Since the first store voted to unionize in December of 2021 in Buffalo, workers at more than 350 Starbucks in nearly 40 states across the country have held votes to unionize, citing various concerns – from safer working conditions during the pandemic and better wages, to better benefits and more reliable schedules.Despite this growing movement, the $122 billion-dollar corporation has fought their workers every step of the way, including refusing to bargain a first contract in good faith, delay tactics, and a significant escalation in union busting. There have been 500 unfair labor practice cases filed against Starbucks and its affiliates. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued 75 complaints in response to those charges and has sought emergency preliminary injunctive relief in five cases in the Federal courts.Sanders has sent three letters to Schultz in the last year calling on the CEO to end the egregious union-busting campaign the company has deployed against its own workers. Schultz has not yet responded to or provided the documents requested in the most recentletterSanders sent in January 2023.The Democratic members of the HELP Committee asked Schultz, who during the pandemic became $800 million richer and is now worth $3.9 billion, to respond to the invitation confirming attendance to the hearing by February 14.Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: In Remarks to Advocates, Sanders Proposes Major Expansion of Community Health Centers
Date: February 8, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the new chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on Wednesday during remarks to Advocates for Community Health proposed a historic expansion of community health centers.“We must expand these programs so that every American has the ability to access the primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs that they desperately need,” Sanders said, citing many of the benefits of community health centers to taxpayers and patients.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:Let me thank the Advocates for Community Health for inviting me here today and for all of the outstanding work that you are doing.I don’t think I need to tell anyone in this room that we have a health care crisis in America that we have got to address.In America today, 85 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, over 500,000 people go bankrupt each year because of medically related debt, and over 68,000 people die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need.We spend over twice as much per-capita for health care than other major nations – nearly $13,000 for every man, woman, and child in the country. And yet, we have worse health outcomes and lower life expectancy than most developed nations – while private health insurance companies make over $60 billion a year in profits and pay their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages.We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Despite billions in government investment in prescription drug research and development, nearly one out of four Americans are unable to afford the medicine their doctors prescribe.Now, I happen to believe that the solution to this crisis is to join every other major country on earth and recognize that health care is a human right, not a privilege. But I am not naïve. And the best way to accomplish that goal is through a Medicare-for-All, Single-payer system. Unfortunately, while tens of millions of American agree with me on that issue, we are far from a majority in the Senate. We have no Republican support for Medicare for All and I’m not sure that I could get half of the Democrats on that bill.Nonetheless, it’s imperative that we continue to push for a Medicare for All system and educate the American people about the dysfunctionality of the current system. And that’s why in several months I will be introducing legislation for Medicare for All.But while we cannot achieve Medicare for All at this moment, this is what I do believe. I believe that, with your help, we can and we must make primary health care available to every man, woman and child in America through a major expansion of community health centers in America.In my view, community health centers are a very bright and effective spot in the midst of our broken health care system.The beauty of community health centers is that they are democratically run by the people on the ground to address the health care needs in their own cities and towns.I am proud to say that in the last 15 years, working together, we have significantly expanded the reach of community health centers.Today, in America, 30 million men, women, and children – including 400,000 veterans – receive high quality primary health care at community health centers in 14,000 neighborhoods throughout the United States.In my own state of Vermont, nearly one out of every three people are now receiving their primary healthcare through a community health center across 73 sites – something that Vermonters are very proud of.And, as all of you know, these centers do more than just provide primary healthcare.They also provide dental care, an issue that is too often ignored when we talk about the healthcare crisis.They provide mental health counseling, which is more important now than it has ever been because of the opioid and heroin epidemic our country is experiencing, and the incredible stresses caused by the pandemic.Equally important, they provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time when so many Americans cannot afford the medicines they need.And, these health centers provide this care regardless of a person’s insurance status, bank account, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity or nationality.That is what community health centers do, and they do it well, and they do it cost effectively.And that is why community health centers have historically enjoyed bi-partisan support – and that support continues to this day.President George W. Bush said back in 2005 for example: “I’m a big backer of expanding community health centers to every poor county in America.” And he was followed by Barack Obama who also believed very strongly in community health centers.But here is the challenge. There are many Republicans who will tell you that while they are strong supporters of these centers, they are also very worried about the deficit and believe in fiscal responsibility.Well let’s be clear: Community health centers not only save lives, they also save money.And our job is to make it clear to Congress that if you are worried about the deficit you should support an expansion of community health centers because each and every year, community health centers save the healthcare system $24 billion. How?It happens because community health centers reduce the need for expensive emergency room visits and hospitalizations, they fight disease outbreaks and they are on the frontlines in addressing our nation’s opioid crisis.In fact, it is at least $2,300 less expensive for a Medicaid patient to receive primary health care at a community health center than at another provider.It is over $1,200 less expensive for a Medicare patient to receive the care they need at a community health center than at another provider.Community health centers not only save lives, not only ease human suffering, but they save billions for the federal government. They save Medicare money. They save Medicaid money. And they save our entire health care system money because they avoid the need for patients to go to expensive emergency rooms and private hospitals.Further, community health centers also add about $55 billion to the economy and provide jobs to more than 235,000 people each and every year.And let’s also be clear. Not only do we have to substantially expand funding for the community health center program, we have also got to address the severe shortage of primary care doctors, nurses, mental health providers and dentists in our country.Community health centers will do no one any good if they do not have the medical staff necessary to treat their patients.In America today, nearly 100 million of our people live in a primary care desert, nearly 70 million live in a dental care desert and some 158 million Americans – nearly half the population live in a mental health care desert.During the pandemic, nearly 1 out of every 5 health care workers, including 100,000 nurses, quit their jobs and another third have contemplated doing so.Over the next decade, our country faces a shortage of over 120,000 doctors – including a huge shortage of primary care doctors.Over the next two years, it is estimated that we will need up to 450,000 more nurses.Today, it is estimated that we need about 100,000 more dentists.And in America today, day, there is a shortage of more than 4 million mental health service providers.That is why I believe we need a major expansion of the National Health Service Corps program — the program that provides scholarships and debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, and mental health providers, who are prepared to work in our nation’s most underserved areas.Without debt forgiveness, it is very hard to get new doctors to choose primary care — an area of medicine that does not pay the kind of money as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills or a neurosurgeon in New York City.But we have got to do a lot more than that. We also need to substantially expand Teaching Health Centers, the Nurse Corps, the Nurse Faculty Loan Program, and the Graduate Medical Education program, among many other things.During the last Congress, as the Chairman of the Budget Committee, I was very proud to help lead the effort to triple funding for the National Health Service Corps and nearly double funding – $7.6 billion – for community health centers as part of the American Rescue Plan.This Congress, as Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I look forward to working with all of you to expand these programs even further.As you know, if Congress does nothing, some of these programs will run out of funding on September 30th of this year. We absolutely cannot allow that to happen.Instead, we must expand these programs so that every American has the ability to access the primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs that they desperately need.We must enable every pregnant woman in America to get the prenatal care they require in order to have healthy babies.We must enable everyone in America who is addicted to opioids to receive the treatment they desperately need.We must enable every American to receive the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe at a cost they can afford.We must give community health centers the funding and resources they need to hire more primary care doctors, nurses, dentists, and mental health counselors who keep these centers going.And I look forward to working with all of you to make that a reality.Thank you all very much.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) at 1:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 9th will hold a press conference with rail workers to demand companies provide them with at least seven paid sick days. Sanders will be joined by representatives from SMART-TD, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, the AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department, and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.Sanders led the effort late last year to pass an amendment to guarantee paid sick days to rail workers. The amendment, which passed the House but failed in the Senate, received the votes of every Senate Democrat, but one, as well as six Republicans. Braun voted for the amendment.Following the vote, Sanders and more than 70 of his colleagues sent aletterto President Biden urging his administration to take action to guarantee paid sick days for rail workers.The press conference comes as rail companiesannouncerecord earnings during quarterly earnings calls. Last year, the top railroads made over $26 billion in profits and paid their wealthy shareholders over $25 billion in stock buybacks and dividends. They spent 184 percent more on returns to their shareholders than what they spent on their workers’ wages and benefits. Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would cost the industry just $321 million dollars – less than 1.2 percent of profits in a single year. Rail companies have eliminated 30 percent of their workforce over the last six years.DetailsWhat:Sanders and Braun Hold Press Conference with Rail WorkersWhen:Thursday, Feb. 9, 1:30 p.m. ETWhere:Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, 430 Dirksen Senate Office BuildingNote:The event will also be livestreamed atwww.twitter.com/SenSandersandhttps://www.facebook.com/senatorsanders

Title: NEWS: In New Letter, Sanders Calls on CEO Howard Schultz to End Starbucks’ “Ruthless Union Busting Campaign” Against Own Workers
Date: January 18, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 – Following up on a previouslettersent in October of last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on Wednesday sent aletterto Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz calling for the company to once and for all end its egregious union busting campaign against its own workers in stores across the country.“It has been nearly 400 days since the first Starbucks union was certified by the NLRB, and yet you and your company have refused to bargain a first contract in good faith,” Sanders wrote. “Mr. Schultz, my request to you is simple: Obey the law. Sit down with your workers and bargain in good faith. Agree to a first contract that is fair and just. Stop shutting down pro-union shops and reinstate workers who have been fired for union organizing, including Ms. Brisack.”Unlawfully fired for “the crime” of her courageous and effective union organizing efforts in Buffalo, New York, Jaz Brisack filed an unfair labor practice charge against Starbucks. The National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) General Counsel recently found merit with her claims and issued an official complaint against the company.Sanders continued: “This request should not be difficult. Starbucks is a $122 billion-dollar corporation. In the first nine months of last year, Starbucks made $3.3 billion in profits and had enough money to provide its outgoing CEO, Kevin Johnson, with a $60 million golden parachute on top of his 39 percent pay raise. While Starbucks workers have risked their health and well-being to make your company successful during the pandemic, you became $800 million richer and are now worth $3.8 billion.”Since the first store voted to unionize in December of 2021 in Buffalo, workers at more than 330 Starbucks in nearly 40 states across the country have held votes to unionize, citing various concerns – from safer working conditions during the pandemic and better wages, to better benefits and more reliable schedules.Despite this growing movement, corporate leadership has fought their workers every step of the way, including after longtime CEO Schultz returned to head the company in April of 2022. Corporate leadership has refused to bargain a first contract in good faith, instead resorting to delay tactics and significant escalation in union busting, including the unlawful firing of employees, having the police called in response to a peaceful and lawful congregation of workers attempting to present their request for union recognition, and the shuttering of unionized stores.There have been nearly 500 unfair labor practice cases filed against Starbucks and its affiliates. The NLRB has issued 69 complaints in response to those charges and has sought emergency preliminary injunctive relief in five additional cases in the Federal courts.Sanders concluded the letter by writing: “The American people are growing increasingly disgusted with this type of outrageous corporate greed. As a United States Senator, I have zero tolerance for large, profitable corporations that flagrantly violate labor law, treat their workers with contempt, and refuse to bargain in good faith. I look forward to hearing from you soon.”Ahead of their vote, Sandersralliedwith the Buffalo store workers in support of their fight to unionize andcontinuedto rally support as more stores joined the movement. In addition to the unionizing movement at Starbucks, Sanders has worked to rally support for the record wave of worker protests across industries and states, including amongminers,steelworkers,health careworkers,bakeryworkers, and workers atAmazon,Kellogg,John Deere,McDonald’s,Frito-Lay,NYU,Churchill Downs, and more.Read the full letterhere.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO also found that, on average, large, profitable American corporations paid less than 9 percent of their profits in federal income taxes in 2018.“While House Republicans want to make huge cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid because of their ‘serious concern’ about the deficit, they voted to provide over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to large corporations and the top one percent,” Sanders said. “The situation has become so absurd that over a third of the largest and most profitable corporations in our country pay nothing in federal income taxes. Instead of cutting vital and popular programs like Social Security and Medicare, we need to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the rich and demand that the largest corporations in America finally start paying their fair share of taxes.”While the GAO report does not identify individual companies,a report from the Center for American Progresslast year found that AT&T made $29.6 billion in 2021, but paid nothing in federal income taxes that year. Instead, AT&T got a $1.2 billion refund from the IRS. Similarly, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy identified 55 profitable Fortune 500 companies.The latest GAO report is one of the first comprehensive studies showing the enormous windfall that the Trump tax cuts gave to large corporations. The report finds the average tax rate for companies in 2017 was 14.6 percent, which dropped to just 8.9 percent in 2018.This report follows a2016 GAO reportrequested by Sanders that found profitable American corporations paid just 14 percent of their profits in federal income taxes on average from 2008 through 2012, and about one-fifth of them paid nothing at all each year.In 2021, Sanders and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) introduced theCorporate Tax Dodging Prevention Actthat would have restored the pre-Trump corporate tax rate of 35 percent and comprehensively shut down offshore corporate tax avoidance. The provisions in this bill to close offshore loopholes alone could raise over$1 trillionin revenue from multinational companies over the next decade.To read the report, clickhere.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Sanders to Give Major Speech on the State of the Working Class
Date: January 12, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Jan. 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the incoming chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday will give a major speech at the U.S. Capitol on the state of America’s working class and how we address the existing crises.

“Before we can effectively go forward in terms of economic policy, it’s necessary to know where we are at,” Sanders said. “And for working families in this country, the situation is not good. At a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, real inflation-adjusted weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were 50 years ago. Over 60% of American workers are living paycheck to paycheck, 85 million are uninsured or underinsured, nearly 600,000 are homeless and millions are unable to afford housing, childcare or higher education.

“Now is the time for Congress – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – to have the courage to take on the lobbyists and powerful special interests and show the American people that our government can work for them, and not just the 1%,” Sanders said.

Title: NEWS: In Letter to CEO, Sanders Calls Moderna Plan to Raise Price of COVID-19 Vaccine “Unacceptable Corporate Greed”
Date: January 10, 2023
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Jan. 10 – Following news reports that the pharmaceutical corporation plans to quadruple its price for the COVID-19 vaccine up to $130 per dose, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, on Tuesday sent a letter to Moderna’s CEO urging the company to reconsider its decision and refrain from any price increase in light of the role the federal government has played in the development of the vaccine.Sanders wrote: “The huge increase in price that you have proposed will have a significantly negative impact on the budgets of Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs that will continue covering the vaccine without cost-sharing for patients. Your decision will cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Your outrageous price boost will also increase private health insurance premiums. Perhaps most significantly, the quadrupling of prices will make the vaccine unavailable for many millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans who will not be able to afford it. How many of these Americans will die from COVID-19 as a result of limited access to these lifesaving vaccines? While nobody can predict the exact figure, the number could well be in the thousands. In the midst of a deadly pandemic, restricting access to this much needed vaccine is unconscionable.”While the price hike planned by the company would make the lifesaving vaccine unaffordable for millions of Americans, estimates show that the cost of producing the vaccine is now as low as$2.85 per dose– 2.2% of what Moderna plans to charge. Meanwhile, over the last two years, Moderna made over$19 billionin profits off of the COVID-19 vaccine which they developed in partnership with scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a U.S. government agency that is funded by U.S. taxpayers. The federal government directly provided$1.7 billionto Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine research and development, and guaranteed the company billions more in sales.While nearly1.1 million Americansdied from COVID-19 in the last three years and over 100 million more have become ill, Moderna has used those profits to provide incredibly extravagant compensation packages to top officials at the company. In addition to CEO Bancel becoming a multi-billionaire as a direct result of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, with Forbes currently estimating his wealth at$6.1 billion, Noubar Afeyan, Moderna’s chairman and co-founder, is currently worth$2.1 billion; Robert Langer, another co-founder of Moderna, is now worth$2.2 billion; and Timothy Springer, a founding investor in Moderna is now worth$2.6 billion.“The purpose of the recent taxpayer investment in Moderna was to protect the health and lives of the American people, not to turn a handful of corporate executives and investors into multi-billionaires,” Sanders wrote to CEO Bancel. “As you know, the federal government, over the years, has supported Moderna every step of the way going back to 2013 when your company reportedly only had three employees. Now, in the midst of a continuing public health crisis and a growing federal deficit, is not the time for Moderna to be quadrupling the price of this vaccine. Now is not the time for unacceptable corporate greed.”Read the full letter,here.The text of the full letter is below.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Longstanding Legislation to Help Workers Expand Employee Ownership Passes the Senate in 2023 Omnibus
Date: December 22, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 – First introduced in 2009, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday announced his Worker Ownership, Readiness, and Knowledge (WORK) Act, essential legislation to help workers expand employee ownership across the country, was included in the $1.7 trillion omnibus that passed the U.S. Senate on Thursday ahead of the Friday deadline.

“Workers deserve an ownership stake in the companies they work for, a say in the decisions that impact their lives, and a fair share of the profits that their work makes possible,” said Sen. Sanders. “This modest but effective legislation will go a long way to ensuring workers have the tools they need to have a seat at the table they worked to build. By making sure workers have their seat and their voices are heard, we can start to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few.”

Study after study has shown that employee ownership creates higher wages, better benefits, and a more secure retirement; as well as increasing employment, sales, and savings, and decreasing gender and racial wealth disparities. This is in large part because employee-owned businesses boost employee morale, dedication, creativity, and productivity, as workers share in profits and have more control over their own work lives. Studies have also shown employee-owned companies are less likely to outsource U.S. jobs and are more likely to see boosts in shareholder returns and profits. A recent study confirmed that expanding employee ownership could quadruple the share of wealth held by the bottom 50 percent of Americans.

In 2019, about 25 million workers already owned some stock in the company where they worked. Today, more than 10,000 companies representing millions of workers across the country use an employee-ownership model, including more than 50 employee-owned companies headquartered in Vermont.

“On behalf of the more then 10 million American households that already benefit from an ESOP, we are deeply grateful to Sen. Sanders for his dedication to include the WORK Act in the omnibus,” said Jim Bonham, President and CEO of The ESOP Association. “Starting years ago with the Vermont Employee Ownership Center that he helped create, we have learned that increased education, awareness, and feasibility grants directly results in more employee owned businesses and now those lessons can be applied across the nation. More employee owned businesses mean more stable local jobs, higher incomes, increased retirement savings, better work environments, and more productivity for our economy. This is how American capitalism is supposed to work – by including everyone.”

Modeled on the success of the Ohio and Vermont employee ownership centers, the WORK Act authorizes a $50 million grant program to help establish and expand employee ownership centers across the country. These centers provide workers with the tools they need to own their own businesses through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) or eligible worker owned cooperatives. This act will authorize the Department of Labor to provide education and outreach, training, and technical support for local and state programs dedicated to the promotion of employee ownership and participation. Sanders helped establish the Vermont Employee Ownership Center in 2001 and first introduced the WORK Act in 2009. Sanders also secured $158,000 for the Vermont Employee Ownership Center as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 earlier this year.

The funding package now heads to the House of Representatives and then to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The funding package also included the first increase in funding for the National Labor Relations Board in a decade.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Secures More Than $42 Million for Vermont Communities in Government Funding Omnibus for 2023
Date: December 22, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday announced more than $42 million, that he secured on behalf of 51 Vermont projects, has been included in the $1.7 trillion omnibus legislation that passed the U.S. Senate on Thursday ahead of the Friday deadline.

Sanders’ Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) projects for the Fiscal Year 2023 address critical needs across Vermont, including in health care, child care, infrastructure, clean energy and water, farming and agriculture, education, and housing. The year-end spending package, to fund the government through 2023, now heads to the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Biden.

“Too many Vermonters, and people across the country, have lost hope that government can work for them in real ways,” said Sen. Sanders. “Too many have lost hope that government is listening to what they need and taking real action on their behalf. With these projects, I am glad to say, Vermonters will soon see real, positive benefits in their daily lives and in their communities. I was proud to see these projects through the Senate and look forward to seeing them have a meaningful impact in Vermont communities as quickly as possible.”

Sanders’ WORK Act also passed in the omnibus, authorizing a $50 million grant program – modeled on the success of the Ohio and Vermont employee ownership centers – to establish and expand local employee ownership centers across the country. Sanders helped establish the Vermont Employee Ownership Center in 2001 and first introduced the WORK Act in 2009. Study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, productivity, sales, savings, and wages in the U.S.; and helps to decrease gender and racial wealth disparities. There are more than 50 employee-owned companies headquartered in Vermont, including well-known local names like Switchback, King Arthur Baking Company, Gardener’s Supply Company, and Chroma Technology.

The funding package also includes: a 30% increase in the Child Care and Development Block Grant program to $8 billion; nearly a billion dollars more for Head Start; a doubling of funding for community schools to $150 million; a $500 increase in the maximum Pell Grant to nearly $7,400; a $1.2 billion increase in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to over $5 billion; and the first increase in funding for the National Labor Relations Board in a decade to nearly $300 million.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Bowman, Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez, Payne, Bush, Lead Letter with More Than 70 Total Signers in the Senate and House Urging Biden to Take Executive Action on Paid Sick Days for Rail Workers
Date: December 9, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-N.J.), Chair of the House Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, and Cori Bush (D-Mo.), on Friday led aletterwith more than 70 total signers in the House and Senate urging President Biden to take executive action to guarantee rail workers paid sick days.“While this agreement was much better than the disastrous proposals put forward by the rail industry, it still does not guarantee a single paid sick day to rail workers who work dangerous and difficult jobs, have risked their lives during the pandemic to keep our economy moving and have not received a pay raise in over three years,” the members wrote. “That is unacceptable and must be rectified.”The letter was signed by 15 colleagues in the Senate and 52 in the House, including Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.); and Reps. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), Don Beyer (D-Va.), Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.), André Carson (D-Ind.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), John Garamendi (D-Calif.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), Al Green (D-Texas), Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Henry Johnson (D-Ga.), Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), John Larson (D-Conn.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Andy Levin (D-Mich.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Marie Newman (D-Ill.), Eleanor Norton (D-D.C.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Mary Scanlon (D-Pa.), Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.), Dina Titus (D-Nev.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Susan Wild (D-Pa.).The letter comes just a week after Congress passed legislation to avert a nationwide rail strike but failed to pass an amendment to guarantee paid sick days to rail workers. The amendment, which passed the House but failed in the Senate, received the votes of every Senate Democrat, but one, as well as six Republicans.“As you know, a majority in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives voted for legislation to guarantee seven paid sick days to every rail worker in America,” the members wrote. “Tragically, because of the arcane rules of the Senate, this legislation was filibustered by just 42 Republicans and one Democrat and did not make it to your desk for signature. It is literally beyond belief that rail workers are not guaranteed this basic and fundamental human right. Therefore, we urge you and your administration to do everything within your authority to guarantee rail workers the seven paid sick days that they desperately need through executive action.”Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would cost the rail industry a grand total of $321 million a year – less than 2% of its profits. Last year alone, the rail industry made a record-breaking $20 billion in profits after cutting their workforce by 30% over the last 6 years. In the first three quarters of 2022, rail companies spent $25.5 billion on stock buybacks and dividends. Rail workers across the U.S. currently are guaranteed zero sick days, paid or unpaid, and are forced to work under a points-based attendance policy that can penalize and even fire workers for taking sick time, including for family and health emergencies. The current deal that passed Congress does not include any paid sick days.In addition to executive order power to deliver paid sick days to rail workers, the letter points to the authority held by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards for businesses affecting interstate commerce, as well as the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation to promote safety in all areas of railroad operations under the Federal Railroad Safety Act. In 2015, then President Obama also issued anexecutive orderthat required companies with federal contracts to grant at minimum seven days of paid sick leave. However, rail workers were excluded from these protections.“You can and you must expand this executive order,” the members wrote. “Over 115,000 rail workers in this country are looking to you to guarantee them the dignity at work they deserve and to ensure that our rail system is safe for its workers and for millions of Americans who cross rail tracks every day. Through Executive Order, agency rulemaking, and any other applicable authority, we ask that you take quick and decisive action to guarantee these workers paid sick leave.”Read the full letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces Thirteenth Annual State of the Union Essay Contest
Date: November 17, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 17 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has launched his thirteenth annual State of the Union Essay Contest.

Each year, the President of the United States delivers the “State of the Union” address to a joint session of Congress, which outlines priorities for the coming year. Sanders knows that great ideas can come from anyone – not just those in power – which is why he created the State of the Union Essay Contest to encourage young people to engage in the political process. The contest is an opportunity for Vermont high school students to describe a major issue facing our country and propose what they would do to solve it.

“There is no doubt that in the recent midterm election young people played a decisive role in electing senators, representatives, governors, and state legislators,” Sanders said. “The future of this country rests in their hands and their lives, by definition, will be more impacted by the decisions that are made right now in city halls, state houses, and in the Congress than anyone else. That’s why I am proud to host this contest every year and hear our Vermont students actively engage in democracy, no matter where they stand on the issues. I look forward very much to reviewing the essays that are submitted.”

The 250-500 word essays can be on any issue of national importance. A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers will judge the essays on the students’ ability to articulate an issue and propose a solution, without regard to the students’ political views. Following the contest, Sanders will enter the essays of the finalists into the Congressional Record – the official archive of the U.S. Congress.

Over 5,300 students from high schools across Vermont have written essays in the past twelve years about critically important issues, including climate change, racial justice, access to mental health care, immigration reform, the state of our democracy, and much, much more. Last year, Sasha Lann from Brattleboro Union High School was selected as the winner from 409 submissions for their essay on voting rights.

The deadline for student essay submissions is January 10, 2023. More information can be found on Sanders’ Senate website at https://www.sanders.senate.gov/stateoftheunion/ or by calling (800) 339-9834.

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Oct. 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday will welcome Finland’s Ambassador to the United States Mikko Hautala to Vermont to exchange ideas about what Vermonters can learn from Finland and what Finland can learn from Vermont on a range of issues, including health care, education, housing, and the environment.

During the visit, Sen. Sanders and Ambassador Hautala will hold a student town meeting at the Harwood Union Middle and High School in Moretown and a public town meeting in Burlington to discuss how U.S. laws affect our daily lives in the U.S. and how Finland addresses those same issues. Both town meetings will include a question-and-answer session to hear directly from students and the public.

“If we are to address the myriad crises that face our communities, we must not close our eyes to how those same issues are affecting communities around the world and how other countries are choosing to act,” said Sanders. “What is it like to be a working parent in Finland? To go to the doctor? To pay for college? To find affordable housing? To age with dignity? There is much that we can learn from Finland and that Finland can learn from Vermont. I very much look forward to this discussion and hope Vermonters from across the state will join us for this exchange of ideas.”

“It will be a great honor to meet with students and other Vermonters, and hear more from them,” said Ambassador Hautala. “Vermont and Finland are alike in many ways – just think of our nature and forests – and I’m certain we can learn a lot from each other. Finland might not be the best country in everything but we are the happiest country in the world. And that’s a lot.”

Title: NEWS: Rich Got Richer While Middle Class Took on More Debt and Fell Further Behind, According to New CBO Report
Date: September 28, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
Families in the top 10 percent held more than two-thirds of all wealth, while families in the bottom 25 percent on average had more debt than assets

WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 — According to a new report requested by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), wealth inequality for families in the United States has widened significantly in the 30-year period from 1989 to 2019, with the wealthiest one percent getting $29 trillion richer as the average working family saw only a negligible increase.

The report showed the concentration of wealth held by the top 10 percent of families increased from 64 percent to 72 percent – driven almost entirely by an increase in the share held by the top 1 percent, which jumped from 27 percent to 34 percent. During the same 30-year period, the bottom half of Americans saw their share of the nation’s wealth drop from 4 percent to 2 percent.

“This report confirms what we already know: The very rich are getting much, much richer while the middle class is falling further and further behind, and being forced to take on outrageous levels of debt,” said Sanders. “The obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue that we cannot continue to ignore or sweep under the rug. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little. In the richest country on Earth, the time is long overdue for us to create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.”

CBO’s report made clear that by 2019, the richest half of Americans more than fully recovered from the losses of the Great Recession of 2008. Meanwhile, even before the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, families in the bottom half of the country continued to struggle with less wealth in 2019 than they had in 2007.

The findings also highlighted the persistence of the racial wealth gap and the growing burden of debt for working class Americans. According to the report, after the generation born in the 1940s, each succeeding generation has had less wealth and more debt than previous generations did at the same age. While families in the top 10 percent held more than two-thirds of all wealth, families in the bottom 25 percent on average had more debt than assets. By 2019, student loan debt was the largest component of total debt for families in the bottom 25 percent – greater than mortgage debt and credit card debt combined. Among those under the age of thirty-five, 60 percent of their debt was student loan debt.

CBO last published a report on trends in the distribution of family wealth in2016, upon the request of Sanders, which analyzed trends from 1989 to 2013.

Date: September 28, 2022

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA)—the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere—and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released the following statements after their resolution supporting democratic institutions in Brazil was passed by the Senate. The move comes amid Brazilians’ fears that the results of next week’s general election could be undermined by President Bolsonaro, who is down in the polls and has told his base to “go to war” if the election is “stolen.”

“At a time when democracy is under attack in Brazil, the United States, and in countries around the world, we all have a responsibility to stand up for peoples’ fundamental right to have a voice in their government, free from fear of retribution or political retaliation,” said Kaine. “With this vote, the Senate sent a powerful message that we are committed to linking arms with the people of Brazil in support of their country’s democracy and remain confident that Brazil’s electoral institutions will ensure a free, fair, and transparent vote.”

“It is imperative that the U.S. Senate make it clear through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil,” said Sanders. “It would be unacceptable for the United States to recognize a government that came to power undemocratically, and it would send a horrific message to the entire world. It is important for the people of Brazil to know we’re on their side, on the side of democracy. With passage of this resolution, we are sending that message.”

Brazilians have sounded the alarm over troubling signs of democratic backsliding in the country, including attacks from government officials on the country’s democratic institutions and rule of law; the kidnapping and murder of advocates and journalists; unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system; and a dramatic increase in violence directed at Brazilian political leaders.

In response, the resolution urges the Government of Brazil to ensure that the upcoming presidential election is conducted in a free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful manner that enables all citizens of Brazil to exercise the right to vote. Additionally, the resolution calls for the United States Government to continue to speak out against efforts to incite political violence and undermine the electoral process in Brazil, and to review and reconsider its relationship with any government that comes to power in Brazil through undemocratic means.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Removal of Big Oil’s Side Deal from Government Funding Legislation
Date: September 27, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday issued the following statement after Majority Leader Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced he was removing Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) big oil side deal from a critical government funding bill:

“I want to congratulate the more than650 environmental groupsand community organizations who made clear that, in the midst of the horrific climate crisis that we face, the last thing we need is a side deal which would build more pipelines and fossil fuel projects that would have substantially increased carbon emissions. This is a victory for the survival of the planet and a major loss for the fossil fuel industry.

“The United States and the rest of the world must move away from our dependence on authoritarian regimes, like those in Russia and Saudi Arabia, for our energy. We must now go forward in creating millions of new jobs by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Tentative Rail Agreement
Date: September 15, 2022

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday issued the following statement after rail carriers and rail workers reached a tentative collective bargaining agreement:

“Let me congratulate the rail unions who stood up to corporate greed, forced the industry to make important concessions, and negotiated better wages, benefits and working conditions. I also want to thank President Biden and Secretary Walsh for their hard work on this deal. Importantly, under the tentative agreement that was reached this morning, CEOs in the rail industry whose companies are making record-breaking profits will no longer be able to fire workers for going to a doctor for a medical emergency. The fact that Republicans were trying to ram through a bill that would have prevented workers from receiving the sick leave and health care benefits they deserve is an outrage. I am proud to have blocked those efforts.

“Now it’s up to the rank-and-file union members to evaluate this deal and determine whether it works for them. These workers have not had a raise in three years and continue to work incredibly long hours under brutal working conditions. I will respect and support whatever decision they make.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Highlights Failures of Health Care System and Calls for Medicare for All
Date: September 14, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday on the floor of the U.S. Senate urged support for Medicare for All following arecent pollshowing America’s dissatisfaction with our dysfunctional and collapsing health care system.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.M. President, I understand that there is a lot that is going on in this world today. We’re worried about climate change. We’re worried about the terrible war in Ukraine. We’re worried about inflation and the fact that wages are not keeping up with prices.We’re worried about massive income and wealth inequality and the increased concentration of ownership that we see in our country – among many other things.But the American people remain deeply concerned about an issue that by definition touches every single one of us – and that is our collapsing and dysfunctional healthcare system.While it is not discussed much in the corporate media or here in the halls of Congress, we have today in the United States the most inefficient, bureaucratic and expensive health care system in the world. That’s not just what I believe. That’s what the American people know to be true because of their lived experience with that system.M. President, I would hope that all Members of Congress take a hard look at a poll that was published yesterday by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. And this is some of what the poll disclosed:At a time when I hear some of my colleagues tell us that we have the best healthcare system in the world, just 12% of the American people believe that health care in general is handled very well or extremely well in the United States. 12 percent.At a time when we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, only 6% of the American people believe that prescription drug costs in the United States are being handled very well or extremely well. Six percent.At a time when COVID has exacerbated the crisis, only 5% of the American people believe that the mental healthcare system in the United States is being handled well or extremely well. 5 percent.And when so many older Americans have died unnecessarily in nursing homes, and when so many cannot even find nursing home beds, just 6% of Americans believe that the quality of care at nursing homes in the United States is very good or exceptional. Six percent.M. President: The American people increasingly understand, as I do, that health care is a human right, not a privilege and that we must end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its citizens.Again, that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what the overwhelming majority of the American people believe.According to yesterday’s AP poll:66% of the American people believe it is the federal government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health insurance coverage. 66 percent.Over 86% of the American people understand that it is absurd that millions of seniors lack dental care, hearing aids and vision care and they believe that Medicare should be expanded to cover these basic healthcare needs. 86 percent.M. President: At a time when our long-term healthcare system is in shambles, 81% of the American people believe that Medicare should cover the outrageous cost of long-term healthcare for senior citizens and people with disabilities. 81 percent.M. President: I ask Unanimous Consent to put this poll into the record.M. President: It is hard for me to imagine how anyone could defend a system in which over 70 million people today are either uninsured or underinsured. As we speak, there are millions of people who would like to go to a doctor but cannot afford to go to a doctor because they cannot afford the outrageous cost of a doctor’s visit or a stay in a hospital.Frankly, I am tired of talking to doctors who tell me about the patients who died because they were uninsured or underinsured, and walked into the doctor’s office when it was too late. And we are talking about some 68,000 Americans who die every year because they are uninsured or under-insured. This is America. This is truly beyond comprehension.I am tired of seeing working class families and small businesses pay far more for healthcare than they can afford which forces more than 500,000 Americans to declare bankruptcy each year because of medically related expenses. Families should not be driven into financial ruin because someone became seriously ill. How insane is that?I am tired of hearing from Americans who lost loved ones because they could not afford the unbelievably high cost of prescription drugs, or hearing from constituents who are forced to cut their pills in half due to the cost. Today, almost 1 out of 4 patients cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.You want to hear about crazy? Crazy is that people get sick. They go to the doctor. They get diagnosed and medicine is prescribed. But they can’t afford to buy the medicine. So they end up in an emergency room or a hospital at great expense to the system. That is crazy.I am tired of talking with people who are struggling with mental illness but cannot afford the mental health counseling they desperately need. Last year, a record-breaking 100,000 people died of drug overdoses and I will tell you that in my office we get desperate calls from family members looking for affordable mental health counseling and, far too often, that help is not there.It’s not there because in this system, geared toward the profits of the insurance companies rather than to the needs of the American people, we don’t have enough psychologists, counselors or social workers.M. President: Unbelievable, despite spending far more per capita on healthcare than any other nation, we don’t have enough doctors. We don’t have enough nurses. We don’t have enough dentists. We do not have enough medical providers in general. We have more than enough people who bill us, and more than enough debt collectors who hound us to pay for a bill we cannot afford, but we just don’t have enough people to provide the healthcare that we desperately need. And, by the way, that crisis is only going to become worse as our society continues to age.M. President: At a time of declining life expectancy, in the wealthiest country on earth, your health and your longevity should not be dependent on the amount of money that you have. It is an absolute outrage and grossly un-American that the number of years you live in this country is dependent upon your income. Studies have shown that the top one percent of Americans live 15 years longer than the poorest people in our society.Healthcare is a human right that all Americans, regardless of income, are entitled to and all Americans deserve the best healthcare that our country can provide.As Chairman of the Budget Committee, it is not acceptable to me that we end up spending over twice as much as virtually any other major country on health care, while our life expectancy and other healthcare outcomes lag behind most other countries.Unbelievably, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), we are now spending $12,530 per capita on healthcare. This is an outrageous and unsustainable sum of money.In comparison, the United Kingdom spends just $5,387 per capita on healthcare while France spends $5,468, Canada spends $5,905, and Germany spends $7,382 while providing universal care to everyone.The question that we should be asking is how does it happen that we spend so much money for healthcare, but get so little in return.M. President: Let’s be clear. The current debate over healthcare in the United States really has nothing to do with healthcare. Frankly, it is hard to defend this dysfunctional system.This debate has everything to do with the unquenchable greed of the healthcare industry and their desire to maintain a system which fails the average American, but which makes the industry huge profits every single year.While ordinary Americans struggled to pay for healthcare during the pandemic, the six largest health insurance companies in our country made over $60 billion in profits last year, led by the UnitedHealth Group, which made $24 billion in 2021.M. President, while millions of Americans cannot afford soaring healthcare costs, the top executives in the insurance industry receive huge amounts of compensation.In 2020, the CEOs of 178 major health care companies collectively made $3.2 billion in total compensation – up 31% from 2019 – all in the midst of the pandemic.According to Axios, in 2020, the CEO of Cigna, David Cordani, took home $79 million; the CEO of Centene, Michael Neidorff, made $59 million; and the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, Dave Wichmann, received $42 million in total compensation.In terms of the pharmaceutical industry, last year Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie – three giant pharmaceutical companies – increased their profits by over 90 percent to $54 billion.Meanwhile, the CEO of Moderna got a $926 million golden parachute after his company received $2.5 billion in taxpayer dollars from the Trump Administration to develop its COVID vaccine.And, while over 330,000 Americans died during the pandemic because they could not afford to go to a doctor on time, the CEO of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals made over $450 million in total compensation last year.M. President: The current system is failing the American people. And the American people want change, real change.In March, I was proud to introduce Medicare for All legislation with 15 Senate co-sponsors. Companion legislation in the House now has 122 co-sponsors.This legislation would improve and expand Medicare to cover, over a 4-year period, healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country.That comprehensive health care coverage would end out-of-pocket expenses and, unlike the current system, it would provide full freedom of choice regarding health care providers.No more insurance premiums, deductibles or co-payments. No more “networks” which deny you your choice of doctors.And when I talk about Medicare for All being comprehensive it would cover dental care, vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs and home and community-based care. In other words, M. President, it would do precisely what the American people want us to do.Would a Medicare-for-all health care system be expensive? Yes. But, while providing comprehensive health care for all, it would be significantly LESS expensive than our current dysfunctional system because it would eliminate an enormous amount of the bureaucracy, profiteering, administrative costs and misplaced priorities inherent in our current for-profit system.Remember: We currently pay twice as much for healthcare as do the people of virtually any other country – all of which provide universal healthcare. So, yes, we can provide quality of care for all at a much lower cost per person.Under Medicare for All there would no longer be armies of people billing us, telling us what is covered and what is not covered and hounding us to pay our hospital bills. This not only saves substantial sums of money but will make life a lot easier for the American people who would never again have to fight their way through the nightmare of insurance company bureaucracy.In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans $650 billion a year.Now, trust me. I know the 30-second ads from the insurance and drug companies have told us that if Medicare for All becomes law, your taxes will go up. But what they won’t tell you is that under Medicare for All, you will no longer be paying premiums, deductibles and co-payments to private health insurance companies.And what they certainly won’t tell you is that Medicare for All will save the average family thousands of dollars a year. In fact, a study by RAND found that moving to a Medicare-for-all system would save a family with an income of less than $185,000 about $3,000 a year, on average.Now, if Medicare for All was so great, you might ask, why hasn’t it been enacted by now? Why hasn’t the United States joined every major country on earth in guaranteeing health care for all?Well, the answer is pretty simple. Follow the money. Since 1998, in our corrupt political system, the private health care sector has spent more than $10.6 billion on lobbying and over the last 30 years it has spent more than $1.7 billion on campaign contributions to maintain the status quo. And, by the way, they are “bi-partisan.” In fact, their contributions go to many members of both the Democratic and Republican parties.But, you know what I believe, M. President?Maybe, just maybe, now is the time for Congress to stand with the American people and take on the powerful special interests that dominate health care in the United States. Now is the time to improve and extend Medicare to everyone.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Gives Floor Remarks on Climate Disasters and the Mountain Valley Pipeline
Date: September 8, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 –Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday on the floor of the U.S. Senate gave remarks on the Mountain Valley Pipeline and the catastrophic climate events happening across the world.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.M. President: I rise this morning to express my strong opposition to the so-called “side-deal” that the fossil fuel industry is pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and destroy the planet.

But before I do, let me put my opposition to this disastrous side-deal into a broader context.

M. President: As the father of 4 and the grandfather of 7, I very much wish that I did not have to say this.  But the most serious challenge facing our country and the entire world today far and away is the existential threat of climate change.  That’s not just Bernie Sanders talking.  That’s what the scientific community is telling us in a virtually unanimous voice.

The latest report from the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is very clear and it is very foreboding.  If the United States, China and the rest of the world do not act extremely aggressively in cutting carbon emissions our planet will face enormous and irreversible damage.  In fact, the world that we will be leaving our children and future generations will be increasingly unhealthy and uninhabitable.

But the truth is we don’t need another study to tell us that.

The American people and people throughout the world are seeing the devastating impact climate change is having on their communities and their families with their own eyes. And please understand. Everything that we are seeing today will likely become worse, much worse, in the years to come.

Just take a look around at what’s happening right now in the United States and around the world:

And on and on it goes.

M. President: In the past, a series of climate disasters like these might have seemed like a silly plot in a bad movie about the apocalypse.  Unfortunately, however, this is not a movie. This is reality. This is what we are experiencing right in front of us.  And, again, this entire scenario will likely become worse, much, much worse if the United Sates, China and the rest of the world do not act together to break our dependence on fossil fuel.

Let us be clear: If the entire planet, led by the largest economy in the world the United States of America, does not get its act together, we will see more devastating and extreme heat. We will see more floods, more rising sea levels, more extreme weather disturbances, more ocean acidification, more drought, more famine, more disease, and more human suffering.

And today, to all of my colleagues who have children and grandchildren, I ask you to think about what they will say when they look you in the eyes and ask why did you allow this to happen?

We know that climate change is real. We know that climate change is caused by carbon emissions. We know that climate change is already causing devastating destruction throughout the world.  We know that if we don’t rapidly transform our energy system away from fossil fuels towards energy efficiency and renewable energy the situation will only become worse, much worse and our planet will face irreparable and irreversible harm.

That is the reality that we face today. And yet, given all that we know, given all that the scientists are telling us, what is the United States Congress about to do?

M. President: It is seriously considering legislation to provide a huge giveaway to Big Oil to drill, produce and sell more fossil fuels.

Really? At a time when climate change is threatening the very existence of the planet, why would anybody be talking about substantially increasing carbon emissions and expanding fossil fuel production in the United Sates?  What kind of message does this send to the people of our own country and to suffering people all over the world?

M. President: Like every other member of the Senate I have a pretty good understanding of how politics works. Like every other Senator I understand what campaign contributions are about, what lobbyists do, and the extraordinary power of the fossil fuel industry to push the legislation they want.

But I beg of my colleagues that, at this moment, when the future of the world is literally at stake that we have the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and to tell them, and the politicians they sponsor, that the future of the planet is more important than their short-term profits.

M. President: In the coming weeks and months, the Senate has a fundamental choice to make.

We can listen to the fossil fuel industry and climate deniers who are spending huge amounts of money on lobbying and campaign contributions to pass this dirty side deal.

Or we can listen to the scientists and the environmental community who are telling us loudly and clearly to reject this side deal and eliminate the $15 billion in tax breaks and subsidies Congress is already providing to big oil and gas companies each and every year.

M. President: While the legislative text of this side deal has not been made public, according to a one-page summary that was released last month, this bill would make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits to complete some of the dirtiest and most polluting oil and gas projects in America.

Specifically, this deal would approve the $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline – a 303-mile fracked gas pipeline spanning from West Virginia to Virginia and potentially on to North Carolina. We’re talking about a pipeline that would generate emissions equivalent to 37 coal plants or over 27 million cars each and every year.

M. President: It is hard for me to understand why anyone who is concerned about climate change consider for one second voting to approve a pipeline that would be equivalent to putting 27 million more cars on the road each and every year.

On August 24th, over 650 environmental and civil rights organizations wrote a letter to Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi urging them to reject this side deal. This letter was signed by the Sierra Club, the Sunrise Movement, Friends of the Earth, Physicians for Social Responsibility, 350.org, Greenpeace, Public Citizen, People’s Action and the NAACP.

And here is what that letter says:

“On behalf of 653 frontline communities and environmental…organizations representing millions of members and supporters nationwide, we are writing to express our strenuous opposition to any additional fossil fuel giveaways. Alarming proposals have been referenced by Senator Manchin, in a short memo, and in legislative language that was clearly drafted in consultation with the American Petroleum Institute (API). It has been reported that Manchin has demanded these handouts to the fossil fuel industry as a further price for his vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which already included large giveaways to polluters.  We call on you to unequivocally reject any effort to promote fossil fuels, advance unproven technologies, and weaken our core environmental laws…This fossil fuel wish list is a cruel and direct attack on environmental justice communities and the climate. This legislation would truncate and hollow-out the environmental review process, weaken Tribal consultations, and make it far harder for frontline communities to have their voices heard by gutting bedrock protections in the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Water Act…Supporting this legislation would represent a profound betrayal of frontline communities and constituents across the country who have called on you to…advance a just, renewable energy future.”

M. President: I could not agree more. I ask Unanimous Consent to include this entire letter into the Congressional Record.

M. President: I should also add that at least 59 of our colleagues in the House of Representatives will soon be releasing a letter expressing strong opposition to this side deal.  Let me quote from that letter:

“According to media reports, there is agreement to advance a series of anti-environmental and anti-environmental justice provisions through the House, at the behest of the American Petroleum Institute (API). These destructive provisions will allow polluting manufacturing and energy development projects to be rushed through before the families who are forced to live near them are even aware of the plans…We remain deeply concerned that these serious and detrimental permitting provisions will significantly and disproportionately impact low-income communities, indigenous communities, and communities of color. The inclusion of these provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and environmental justice communities by insulating them from scrutiny. Such a move would force Members to choose between protecting EJ communities from further pollution or funding the government.  We urge you to ensure that these provisions are kept out of a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation this year.”

I ask Unanimous Consent to insert that letter into the Congressional Record.

Today, I am urging all of my colleagues to stand with the 650 organizations and 59 Members of Congress and reject this dirty side deal.

Let me repeat again: For the sake of our children, our grandchildren and future generations we have got to make it clear to the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of our planet.

I thank the president and yield the floor.

Title: Kaine, Sanders and Colleagues Mark Brazil’s Independence Day with Resolution in Support of Brazilian Democracy, Urging Free, Fair, and Peaceful Elections in October
Date: September 7, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) teamed up with Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to unveil a resolution supporting democratic institutions in Brazil. The introduction comes on the Independence Day of Brazil and amid efforts by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to preemptively reject Brazil’s national election results and sow mistrust and spread misinformation regarding next month’s presidential election in the country, where current polls project he will lose re-election.

The resolution is being led in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-03), and Sara Jacobs (CA-53).

“The United States and Brazil are two of the largest democracies in the Western Hemisphere. At a time when democracy is under attack in Brazil, America, and in countries around the world, we have a duty to stand up for peoples’ fundamental right to shape their futures by having a voice in their government, without fear of political violence or retribution,”said Senator Kaine. “This resolution sends a powerful message that Congress is committed to linking arms with the people of Brazil in that effort and that we will not be silent in the face of any attempts to undermine Brazil’s electoral system.”

“It is absolutely imperative that the U.S. Senate make it clear through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil,”said Senator Sanders. “It would be unacceptable for the United States to recognize a government that came to power undemocratically, and it would send a horrific message to the entire world. The United States should make it clear that we support the democratic process, and it’s important for the people of Brazil to know we’re on their side, on the side of democracy.”

“A peaceful transfer of power is integral to a strong democracy,”said Senator Merkley.“But Brazil’s Independence Day celebrations today, amid tension and polarization, underscore just how fragile democracy is and the sustained efforts that are required to preserve it. The U.S. must condemn any and all attempts to incite political violence and intimidation to ensure Brazil’s electoral processes remain free and fair.”

“This resolution recognizes the importance of strengthening democracy in Brazil. Our measure is a call to action to preserve Brazil’s democratic institutions,”said Blumenthal.

“The fate of Brazil’s democracy, which is under daily attack by President Bolsonaro, and of U.S. relations with Brazil, will be decided in the upcoming election.  The Biden Administration must make it unequivocally clear that the costs of subverting a free and fair election will be immediate and severe,”said Senator Leahy.

“As the people of Brazil prepare to vote this fall, right-wing forces are trying to undermine the integrity of the electoral system and poison the process with authoritarian rhetoric that echoes the violent incitement we heard in America before January 6,”said Congressman Raskin. “This bicameral resolution insists that the upcoming elections in Brazil be free and fair, transparent and peaceful. Democracy is under attack around the world, and we must vigorously defend it everywhere against autocracy, insurrection and disinformation.”

“As Brazil’s elections approach, we continue to call on all individuals seeking office to uphold the values of democracy and endorse free, fair, credible, transparent and peaceful elections. Anything less is unacceptable,”said Congressman Grijalva.

“The United States is stronger and safer when our values align with our support to foreign governments,” saidCongresswoman Jacobs. “I’ve been increasingly alarmed by the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., Brazil, and around the world that threatens human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. With Brazilians heading to the polls in less than a month to elect their new president, there are legitimate fears that President Jair Bolsonaro may refuse to step down if he loses. This bicameral resolution is critical and draws an important line: the United States should not formally recognize or provide military aid to an illegitimate government.”

Brazilians have sounded the alarm over troubling signs of democratic backsliding in the country, including attacks from government officials on the country’s democratic institutions and rule of law; the kidnapping and murder of advocates and journalists; unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system; and a dramatic increase in violence directed at Brazilian political leaders.

In response, the resolution urges the Government of Brazil to ensure that the upcoming presidential election is conducted in a free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful manner that enables all citizens of Brazil to exercise the right to vote. Additionally, the resolution calls for the United States Government to continue to speak out against efforts to incite political violence and undermine the electoral process in Brazil, and to review and reconsider its relationship with any government that comes to power in Brazil through undemocratic means.

Title: NEWS: Sanders on President Biden’s Student Debt Announcement
Date: August 24, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Aug. 24 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday issued the following statement after President Biden announced a plan for student debt relief:

“The president’s decision today to reduce the outrageous level of student debt in our country is an important step forward in providing real financial help to a struggling middle class. Today’s announcement to reduce up to $10,000 in student debt for working class Americans and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients will eliminate student debt for some 20 million Americans and reduce debt for some 43 million. The result of this decision is that millions of Americans will now be in a better position to start families, or buy the homes and cars they have long needed. This is a big deal.

“But we have got to do more. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, education, from pre-school through graduate school, must be a fundamental right for all, not a privilege for the wealthy few. If the United States is going to effectively compete in the global economy we need the best educated workforce in the world, and that means making public colleges and universities tuition free as many other major countries currently do – and that includes trade schools and minority-serving institutions as well. In the year 2022, in the wealthiest country on earth, everyone in America who wants a higher education should be able to get that education without going into debt.”

Title: Leahy, Sanders, Welch And Scott Announce $5.8 Million In Northern Border Regional Commission Grants For 14 Vermont Communities
Date: August 24, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
(WEDNESDAY, Aug. 24, 2022) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) together with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Congressman Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Governor Phil Scott, and the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), announced Wednesday that 14 Vermont communities will be receiving a combined $5.8 million from NBRC’s State Economic and Infrastructure Development program.

Leahy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has long championed funding for the NBRC, securing funding increases in each of the past five fiscal years. The NBRC supports economic development in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Maine.

Leahy said: “This current round of grants will once again bring federal dollars to help address real problems, including the need for housing and childcare. These funds will build infrastructure to support future development, as well as workforce development and training. This round of grants is an investment in our present and our future.”

Sanders said: “It is no secret that we are living in difficult times. That is why it is especially important today to invest in our communities and ensure that Vermonters receive the resources they need. This federal funding – the largest investment ever made in community-based projects – will do just that. It will, among many things, expand health centers, create affordable housing, improve public lands and outdoor recreation trails, provide job training in critical fields like early childhood education and health care, and increase child care center capacity. Simply, it will improve the lives of Vermonters all across our state, which is precisely what the federal government should be doing.”

Welch said: “From renovating a beloved community health center in Wells River to revitalizing local infrastructure in Winooski, this round of State Economic and Infrastructure Development awards invests in our communities at a record level. I’m glad to have played a part in securing this essential funding with Senators Leahy and Sanders during the appropriations process. And I’m grateful to the staff at the Northern Border Regional Commission for their leadership and to the Vermonters spearheading these important projects. Together, we can keep working to expand economic opportunity, improve local infrastructure, and build healthier communities across Vermont.”

Scott said: “Vermont’s 2022 slate includes investments into 11 counties, the most geographically varied line-up in years. These awards deploy millions to support economic and Infrastructure development — which are priorities for my Administration. We look forward to the transformational impacts these investments will deliver in the coming years, and I thank Senator Leahy and our entire congressional delegation for their advocacy in Washington.”

“This year’s State Economic and Infrastructure Development awards build upon the natural strengths of our region by investing a record $24.2 million dollars in community-centered projects across the Commission’s four states. With investments in new trails and outdoor recreation infrastructure, workforce development and entrepreneurship programs, and basic water and wastewater infrastructure, these resources will grow economic opportunities for residents of the region” said NBRC Federal Co-Chair Chris Saunders. “The Commission is particularly proud that this year’s slate of projects reach some of the smallest and most rural areas in New York and New England.”

One of the recipients, Otter Creek Child Center, will receive $350,000 as part of an $829,000 renovation and expansion project. “Upon completion, the Community Childcare Expansion Project will increase childcare capacity in rural Addison County by adding 77 childcare slots in a modern, ADA-compliant facility,” said Linda January, executive director of Otter Creek Child Center. “It is our hope that this project will galvanize the corporate, higher education, and non-profit sectors to collaborate in new and creative ways to create a model for the rest of the state of Vermont to address the chronic problem of child care capacity that impacts each sector.”

A $460,020 grant to the Town of Hinesburg will help to pay for a $911,000 expansion of the town’s drinking water system, resulting in an 87 percent increase in capacity and allowing for the construction of 66 permanently affordable homes. “The NBRC award will result in numerous benefits in Hinesburg and the region. Locally, it will enable the town to double its drinking water capacity at a lower cost to its users. Regionally, that additional capacity will help address the housing shortage because the significant amount of planned housing development in Hinesburg requires it,” said Hinesburg Town Manager Todd Odit.

The remaining awards are:

Bennington County Industrial Corporation – $350,000: Supports construction of 92,000 square feet of mixed use, energy efficient building, providing space for Southwestern Vermont Health Care (SVHC), retail spaces, and the creation of 63 new downtown households.Little River Health Care – $350,000: Supports creation of 10 new exam rooms, two new procedure rooms, eight offices, a lab, a new group medical visit room and a reception area.Lake Champlain Sailing Center – $350,000: Supports construction of boat ramp, universally accessible education pier, safe launch site and deep-water basin hoists, improving functionality and safety, while expanding lake access and educational opportunities.Porter Medical Center – $346,223: Supports creating of a simulation lab to provide entry-level training and upskilling education for healthcare workers.Springfield Area Parent Child Center – $196,732.50: Supports purchase of a nearby building to increase capacity within the Learning Together program, which provides education and intensive job skills training to teen and young parents.Town of Lyndon – $350,000: Supports rehabilitation of the Sanborn Bridge, one of the last Paddleford truss covered bridges in existence in the United States, and one of only two in Vermont, while also creating a 1.5-acre riverfront park adjacent to the bridge, connecting nearby recreational trails and waterways.Town of Greensboro – $153,553: Supports creation of a rail trail hub by adding trail amenities facilities to include a parking area, bike racks, tables, benches, artwork, flower tubs, enclosures for restrooms and vending machines, a pad for a food truck and building for a new business collective.City of Winooski – $817,908.37: Supports the Winooski Falls East Development project and Main Street Revitalization project with sidewalk, water and sewer improvements, undergrounding the telecom and cable lines, allowing for future high density commercial and housing development accessible via walking, biking and public transportation.Rutland Economic Development Corporation – $89,746.40: Supports the creation of over 40 acres of prime developable real estate for manufacturing property inventory, allowing expansion of manufacturers and producers, creating high-quality jobs and benefitting all of Rutland County and surrounding areas.Vermont Agency of Transportation – $350,000: Supports cost-effective freight shipping for rural businesses in the Northeast Kingdom and northern Vermont.Town of Montgomery – $817,908.37: Supports “Montgomery Gateway” project, which will construct 1,600 feet of sidewalk, a bike lane, marked crosswalks, and parking along the north side of Route 118, creating a multi-modal connection between the municipal Recreation Center and the state designated Village Center and businesses.Greater Rockingham Area Services, Inc. – $817,908.36: Supports replacement of an antiquated heating system with a new energy-efficient biomass boiler, a boiler backup, and an exterior wood chip silo.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Says Inflation Reduction Act Doesn’t Meet Needs of the American People
Date: August 3, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday on the floor of the U.S. Senate gave remarks on the Inflation Reduction Act, calling on his colleagues to study the bill thoroughly and to come up with amendments and suggestions as to how to improve it in order to meet the needs of the American people.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.

M. President: My understanding is that the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” may be coming to the floor in the coming days.

There are some people who think this bill is worth supporting. There are others who think that it is not. But, whatever your views on this bill may be, let’s be clear: As currently written, this is an extremely modest bill that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises facing the working families of our country. It falls far short of what the American people want, what they need, and what they are begging us to do.

Given that this is the last reconciliation bill that we will be considering this year, it is the only opportunity that we have to do something significant for the American people that requires only 50 votes and that cannot be filibustered. This is an opportunity that must not be squandered.

M. President: Let’s take a brief look at what is going on in tis country today and see whether this reconciliation bill adequately addresses the needs of the American people.

Half of our people live paycheck to paycheck and because of inflation are falling even further behind in their desperation. Does this reconciliation bill raise the minimum wage? No.

Does it provide workers the protections they need in order to form unions? No.

M. President: At a time when the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation on earth, does this bill extend the $300 a month per child tax credit that existed last year? No, it doesn’t.

If you are a parent today paying $15,000 a year for childcare, the average cost in America, does this bill reform our dysfunctional childcare system, make it affordable, and pay childcare workers decent wages? No, it doesn’t.

At a time when over 70 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, when we pay twice as much for health care as the people of almost any other major nation, when some 60,000 people a year die because they cannot afford to go to a doctor when they need to, does this bill do anything to create a rational, cost-effective health care system which guarantees health care for all – something that exists in almost every other major nation? No, it doesn’t.

At a time when 45 million Americans are struggling to pay student debt and when hundreds of thousands of bright young people every year are unable to afford a higher education, does this bill do anything to help them? No, it doesn’t.

M. President: 55% of senior citizens are trying to survive on an income of $25,000 a year or less. Many of them cannot afford to go to a dentist or buy the hearing aids or eyeglasses that they need, does this bill do anything to expand Medicare to cover their basic healthcare needs? No, it doesn’t.

And when we talk about our seniors and disabled Americans, does this bill do anything to help the millions of them who would prefer to stay in their homes rather than be forced into nursing homes? No, it doesn’t.

Everybody agrees that we have a major housing crisis in this country. Some 600,000 people are homeless sleeping out on streets across the country. In addition, nearly 18 million households are spending an incredible 50 percent of their incomes for housing. Does this bill do anything to address the major housing crisis that we face? No, it doesn’t.

M. President: We don’t talk about it much here in the Senate or in the corporate media, but at this moment in American history, we have more wealth and income inequality than at any time in the last 100 years with 3 people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 92%, with 45% of all new income going to the top one percent, and with CEOs of large corporations making 350 times more than their average workers.

M. President: Today, we have more concentration of ownership than at any time in the modern history of this country. In sector after sector, we have a handful of giant corporations often engaging in price-fixing who control what is produced and how much we pay for it. In fact, unbelievably, 3 Wall Street firms control assets of over $20 trillion and are the major stockholders in 96% of S&P 500 companies. Does this bill do anything to attack this enormous concentration of ownership and maker the economy more competitive? No, it doesn’t.

Now, M. President, let me say a few words about what is in this legislation, a bill which has some good features, but also some very bad features.

Prescription Drugs

The good news, M. President, is that the reconciliation bill finally begins to address the outrageous price of some of the most expensive prescription drugs under Medicare.

Under this legislation, Medicare, for the first time in history, would be able to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices.

M. President: The bad news is that we will not see the impact of these negotiated prices until 2026 – four years from now.

The bad news is that, for whatever reason, in 2026, only 10 drugs would be negotiated with more to come in later years.

Moreover, with the possible exception of insulin, this bill does nothing to lower prescription drug prices for anyone who is not on Medicare.

Under this bill, at a time when the pharmaceutical companies are making outrageous profits, the pharmaceutical industry will still be allowed to charge the American people, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

M. President, if we are really serious about reducing the price of prescription drugs, we know exactly how we can do it.

For over 30 years, the VA has been negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry to lower the price of prescription drugs. Moreover, for decades, virtually every major country on Earth has done exactly the same thing for all of their people.

The result: Medicare pays twice as much for the exact same prescription drugs as the VA, and Americans, in some cases, may pay ten times as much for a particular drug as the people of any major country on Earth.

In other words, when it comes to reducing the price of prescription drugs under Medicare – we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

We could simply require Medicare to pay no more for prescription drugs than the VA.

And, M. President, if we did that, we could literally cut the price of prescription drugs under Medicare in half in a matter of months, not years. In February, I introduced legislation with Senator Klobuchar that would accomplish that goal.

Under that legislation, we could save Medicare $900 billion over the next decade. That is nine times more savings than the rather weak negotiation provision in this bill. And, by the way, that money could be used to add comprehensive dental, vision and hearing benefits to every senior in America. It could be used to lower the Medicare eligibility age to at least 60. And it could be used to extend the solvency of Medicare.

And that is why I will be introducing an amendment to make sure that Medicare pays no more for prescription drugs than the VA.

Affordable Care Act

Moreover, M. President, this legislation will extend subsidies for some 13 million Americans who have private health insurance plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act over the next three years. Without this provision, millions of Americans would see their premiums skyrocket and some 3 million Americans could lose their health insurance altogether. This is a good provision, but let’s not fool ourselves. The $64 billion cost of this provision will go directly into the pockets of private health insurance companies that made over $60 billion in profits last year and paid their executives exorbitant compensation packages.

It would also do nothing to help the more than 70 million Americans who are uninsured or under-insured and it would do nothing to reform a dysfunctional healthcare system that is designed not to make people well, but to make the stockholders of private health insurance companies extremely rich.

Climate Change

Now, M. President, this legislation also provides $370 billion over the next decade to combat climate change and to invest in so-called energy security programs.

The good news is that if this legislation is signed into law it would provide far more funding for energy efficiency and sustainable energy than has ever been invested before.

Given the existential crisis that we face this is not enough, but it is a step forward.It provides serious funding for wind, solar, batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles, energy efficient appliances and low-income communities that have born the brunt of climate change.

However, M. President, the bad news is that this legislation includes a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry – both in the reconciliation bill itself and in a side deal that was just made public the other day.

Under this legislation, the fossil fuel industry will receive billions of dollars in new tax breaks and subsidies over the next 10 years – on top of the $15 billion in tax breaks and corporate welfare that they already receive every year.

In my view, if we are going to make our planet healthy and habitable for future generations, we cannot provide billions of dollars in new tax breaks to fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet.  On the contrary, we should end all of the massive corporate welfare that the fossil fuel industry already enjoys.

Under this legislation, up to 60 million acres of public waters must be offered up for sale each and every year to the oil and gas industry before the federal government could approve any new offshore wind development.  To put this in perspective, 60 million acres is the size of Michigan.

M. President let me read to you the headline that appeared in a July 29th article in Bloomberg: “Exxon Loves What Manchin Did for Big Oil in $370 Billion Deal.”

According to Bloomberg, the CEO of Exxon Mobil called the reconciliation bill “a step in the right direction” and was “pleased” with the “comprehensive set of solutions” included in the reconciliation bill.

Barrons recently reported that Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are just a few of the fossil fuel companies that could benefit the most under this bill.

Now, M. President, if the CEO of Exxon Mobil, a company that has done as much as any to destroy this planet, is “pleased” with this bill then I think all of us should have some very deep concerns about what is in this legislation.

Further, under this bill, up to 2 million acres of public lands must be offered up for sale each and every year to the oil and gas industry before leases can move forward for any renewable energy development on public lands.

In total, this bill will offer the fossil fuel industry up to 700 million acres of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling over the next decade – far more than the oil and gas industry could possibly use.

And, M. President, that’s not all.  The fossil fuel industry will not just benefit from the provisions in the reconciliation bill. A deal has also been reached to make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits for their oil and gas projects.

This deal would approve the $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline – a fracked gas pipeline that would span 303 miles from West Virginia to Virginia, and potentially on to North Carolina.

This is a pipeline that would generate emissions equivalent to that released by 37 coal plants or by over 27 million cars each and every year.

M. President, let me quote from a July 29th letter from over 350 environmental organizations including the Sunrise Movement, Food and Water Watch, 350.ORG and the Climate Justice Alliance addressed to the President and the Senate Majority Leader expressing concerns about this bill:

“Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is incompatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas and coal production are the core drivers of the climate and extinction crises. There can be no new fossil fuel leases, exports, or infrastructure if we have any hope of preventing ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic floods, deadly wildfires, and more–all of which are ripping across the country as we speak. We are out of time. Therefore, we’re calling on you to fulfill your promise to lead on climate, starting with denying approvals for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting all new federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and everywhere else, and preventing any fast-tracked permits for fossil fuel projects.”

M. President: I ask Unanimous Consent to insert this full letter into the record.

And here is what the Center for Biological Diversity had to say on this bill: “This is a climate suicide pact. It’s self-defeating to handcuff renewable energy development to massive new oil and gas extraction. The new leasing required in this bill will fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country, and it’s a slap in the face to the communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels.”

In my view, we have got to do everything possible to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, not give billions of dollars in corporate welfare to an industry that has been destroying our planet.

And, I will be introducing an amendment to do just that.

Tax Reform

Finally, M. President, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality; at a time of soaring corporate profits; and at a time in which we have a broken tax system riddled with all kinds of loopholes for the rich and the powerful, this bill makes a few modest changes to reform the tax code.

Under this bill, corporations will be required to pay a minimum tax of 15%. That is the good news. The American people are sick and tired of companies like AT&T, Federal Express and Nike making billions of dollars in profits and paying nothing in federal income tax. This provision has been estimated to raise $313 billion over the next decade.

Further, under this bill, the IRS will finally begin to receive the funding that it needs to audit wealthy tax cheats. Each and every year, the top 1 percent are able to avoid paying more than $160 billion in taxes that they legally owe because the IRS does not have the resources they need to conduct audits of the extremely wealthy. This bill begins to change that.

This bill would also make very modest changes to the so-called carried interest loophole that has allowed billionaire hedge fund managers on Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse, teacher or firefighter.

But the bad news is that this bill does nothing to repeal the Trump tax breaks that went to the very wealthy and large corporations. Trump’s 2017 tax bill provided over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations.  In fact, 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax law are going to the top 1% – and this bill repeals none of those benefits.

And M. President, let’s not forget. It is very likely that Congress will be doing a so-called tax extenders bill at the end of the year that could provide corporations up to $400 billion over the next decade in new tax breaks. If that occurs that would more than offset the $313 billion in corporate revenue included in this bill.

So that, M. President is where we are today. We have legislation which unlike the original Build Back Better plan ignores the needs of working families in childcare, Pre-K, the expansion of Medicare, affordable housing, home healthcare, higher education, and many other desperate needs.

This is legislation which, at a time of massive profits for the pharmaceutical industry, and when we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, takes some very modest steps to lower or control the price of medicine.

This is legislation which has some good and important provisions pertaining to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, but, at the same time, provides massive giveaways to the fossil fuel industry whose emissions are destroying the planet.

This is legislation which appropriately ends the absurdity of large, profitable corporations paying nothing in federal income tax but, at the same time, leaves intact virtually all of Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy and very large corporations.

M. President this more than 700-page bill after months of secret negotiations became public late last week. Now is the time for every member of the Senate to study this bill thoroughly and to come up with amendments and suggestions as to how we can improve it.

I look forward to being part of that process.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday applauded the passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, which will greatly expand health care coverage for America’s veterans, including those who were exposed to toxic burn pits during their deployments:

“As a former chair and longtime member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, one of my highest priorities in the Senate is ensuring our nation’s veterans have access to the quality health care and benefits they have earned and deserve. That’s why I’m proud that we are sending the PACT Act to the President’s Desk. It is the most comprehensive expansion of health care for our nation’s veterans in a generation.

“This legislation expands health care access to over 3.5 million veterans, adds 23 burn pit and toxic exposure-related health conditions to the VA’s list of presumptive conditions to include numerous cancers and respiratory illnesses, and builds on the VA’s infrastructure to bring health care closer to veterans by establishing 31 new VA facilities across 19 states. Additionally, the bill improves toxic exposure research, invests in VA’s workforce, and improves toxic exposure-related education for VA personal.

“The PACT Act does the right thing for our veterans and I was proud to support it.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Calls on Senate to Improve the Inflation Reduction Act and Address the Needs of the American People
Date: August 2, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday delivered his first public comments on the Inflation Reduction Act calling on his colleagues to improve the legislation to meet the needs to of the American people.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere.

Statement on Reconciliation

M. President: I want to say a few words about the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” which I believe may be coming to the floor this week.

But, before I do, I want to put this reconciliation bill into the context of where we are as a nation politically.  And that is not a good place.

According to the most recent Gallup poll, the approval rating for Congress is at 16% with massive numbers of people disapproving of the work we are doing here.

Further, according to a recent University of Chicago poll, a strong majority of Americans believe that the government is “corrupt and rigged against me.”

Further, according to a USA Today poll, a very strong majority no longer believe that the Democratic or Republican parties are responding to their needs and we need to move to a multi-party system. And, most frighteningly, there is a growing number of Americans who believe that they may have to take up arms against their own government in order to accomplish what they think needs to be done.

All of this speaks to a very dangerous moment for American democracy and resembles the conditions that existed in Europe in the 1920s and early 1930s which led to fascism and totalitarianism.

And I should mention that, as we speak, while working families are falling further and further behind economically, the billionaire class through their super-PACs are doing everything they can to elect members of Congress who will support the wealthy and the powerful against the needs of average Americans.

The people of this country believe, in my view correctly, that we have a corrupt political system dominated by the rich and the powerful and we have a rigged economy in which large corporations are seeing huge profits while the middle class and working families continue to decline.

We don’t talk about it much here in the Senate or in the corporate media, but at this moment in American history we have more wealth and income inequality than at any time in the last 100 years with 3 people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society and CEOs of large corporations making 350 times more than their average workers.

That is the overall context in which this reconciliation bill is coming to the floor.

Now, I have heard from some of my colleagues that the Build Back Better legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and supported by some 48 out of the 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus and by the President of the United States is dead.

Now, I don’t know if that is absolutely true or not. But I do know that if it is true it would be a disaster for working families all across this country who are desperately trying to survive economically.

So, let me very briefly tell you what was in the original Build Back Better bill which is not in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.

And, every one of the provisions that I’m going to mention has overwhelming support from the American people according to poll after poll after poll.

At a time when the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation on earth, this bill does not extend the $300 a month per child tax credit that you had last year.

If you are a parent today paying $15,000 a year for childcare, the average cost in America, this bill ignores that crisis completely and does absolutely nothing for you.

And, of course, unlike the original Build Back Better plan, this bill does not provide free and universal Pre-K.

At a time when 45 million Americans are struggling to pay student debt and when hundreds of thousands of young people every year are unable to afford a higher education, this bill does nothing to help them. The original Build Back Better plan provided 2 years of free education at community colleges. Not enough, but an effort to begin addressing the crisis of higher education in this country. Needless to say, this bill ignores that issue completely.

If you are an elderly American, one of the millions who are unable to afford to go to a dentist or buy the hearing aids or eyeglasses that you need, this bill does nothing to expand Medicare to cover these basic health care needs. Millions of seniors will continue to have rotten teeth and lack the dentures, hearing aids, or eyeglasses that they deserve.

Further, at a time when millions of elderly and disabled Americans would prefer to stay in their homes rather than be forced into nursing homes, this bill does absolutely nothing to address the home health care crisis in America. We will continue to lack the decent-paid staffing that we need to address this crisis.

Everybody agrees that we have a major housing crisis in this country. Some 600,000 people are homeless sleeping out on streets across the country. In addition, nearly 18 million households are spending an incredible 50 percent of their incomes for housing. Yep, you guessed it. This bill does nothing to address the major housing crisis that we face or build one unit of safe and affordable housing.  Just another issue that we push aside.

M. President, one of the criticisms against the original Build Back Better plan is that it would be inflationary because it would increase federal spending. That criticism is untrue. Every nickel spent in this bill would be fully paid for by increased taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. Unlike the recently passed micro-chip corporate welfare bill that adds $79 billion to the federal deficit, unlike the proposed military budget that came out of the Senate Armed Services Committee which would increase defense spending by $45 billion more than the Pentagon even requested, Build Back Better would not have increased the deficit at all.

Now, M. President, let me say a few words about what is in this legislation, a bill which has some good features, but also some very bad features.

Prescription Drugs

The good news, M. President, is that the reconciliation bill finally begins to lower the outrageous price of some of the most expensive prescription drugs under Medicare.

According to the most recent data, if we do nothing, Medicare will spend about $1.8 trillion over the next decade on prescription drugs and our nation, as a whole, will spend $5 trillion. That is simply unsustainable.

But, M. President: here’s the bad news.

The prescription drug provisions in this bill are extremely weak, they are extremely complex, they take too long to go into effect and they go nowhere near far enough to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is literally killing Americans.

Under this legislation, Medicare, for the first time in history, would be able to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that the negotiated prices would not go into effect until 2026 – 4 years from now.

Further, in 2026, only 10 drugs would be negotiated with more to come in later years.

Moreover, with the possible exception of insulin, this bill does nothing to lower prescription drug prices for anyone who is not on Medicare.

Under this bill, at a time when the pharmaceutical companies are making outrageous profits, the pharmaceutical industry will still be allowed to charge the American people, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

M. President, if we are really serious about reducing the price of prescription drugs, we know exactly how we can do it.

For over 30 years, the VA has been negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry to lower the price of prescription drugs. Moreover, for decades, virtually every major country on earth has done exactly the same thing for all of their people.

The result: Medicare pays twice as much for the exact same prescription drugs as the VA, and Americans, in some cases, may pay ten times as much for a particular drug as the people of any major country on earth.

In other words, when it comes to reducing the price of prescription drugs under Medicare – we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

We could simply require Medicare to pay no more for prescription drugs than the VA.

And, M. President, if we did that, we could literally cut the price of prescription drugs under Medicare in half in a matter of months, not years. In February, I introduced legislation with Senator Klobuchar that would accomplish that goal.

Under that legislation, we could save Medicare $900 billion over the next decade.  That is nine times more savings than the rather weak negotiation provision in this bill. And, by the way, that money could be used to add comprehensive dental, vision, and hearing benefits to every senior in America. It could be used to lower the Medicare eligibility age to at least 60. And it could be used to extend the solvency of Medicare.

What are the other prescription drug provisions in the reconciliation bill?

Well, under this legislation, pharmaceutical companies would essentially be prohibited from increasing prescription drug prices above inflation pegged to the year 2021.

Should we be making sure that pharmaceutical companies cannot increase their prices above inflation? Yes. But let’s be clear. This provision would lock in all of the outrageous price increases the pharmaceutical industry has made in recent years and would do nothing to lower those outrageous prices.

Under this legislation, out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors would be capped at $2,000 a year. That is a good provision that will benefit up to 2 million seniors who currently pay over $2,000 a year for prescription drugs. But the $25 billion cost of this provision would be paid for not by the pharmaceutical companies making record-breaking profits. No. It would be paid for by increased premiums on virtually every senior citizen in America, although there is a provision to “smooth out” those premium increases.

The current reconciliation bill would also provide free vaccines for seniors – the only population for which vaccines are not already free. That is a good thing that should have been done a long time ago.

Finally, M. President, in terms of prescription drugs, it looks like the reconciliation bill will cap co-pays for insulin at $35 a month – which is a good step forward for people with health insurance, but would do nothing to lower the cost of insulin for the 1.6 million diabetics who are uninsured and who need our help the most.

Affordable Care Act

Moreover, M. President, this legislation will extend subsidies for some 13 million Americans who have private health insurance plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act over the next three years. Without this provision, millions of Americans would see their premiums skyrocket and some 3 million Americans could lose their health insurance altogether. This is a good provision, but let’s not fool ourselves. The $64 billion cost of this provision will go directly into the pockets of private health insurance companies that made over $60 billion in profits last year and paid their executives exorbitant compensation packages.

It would also do nothing to help the more than 70 million Americans who are uninsured or under-insured and it would do nothing to reform a dysfunctional health care system that is designed not to make people well, but to make the stockholders of private health insurance companies extremely rich.

Climate Change

Now, M. President, this legislation also provides $370 billion over the next decade to combat climate change and to invest in so-called energy security programs.

The good news is that if this legislation is signed into law, it would provide far more funding for energy efficiency and sustainable energy than has ever been invested before.

This is substantially lower, however, than the $555 billion in the original Build Back Better plan which understood that climate change is an existential threat to the planet and has to be addressed in an extremely bold way.

But this legislation does provide serious funding for wind, solar, batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles, energy efficient appliances and low-income communities that have born the brunt of climate change.

But, M. President, the ugly news that very few people in the media or Congress wants to talk about is that it includes a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry – both in the reconciliation bill itself and in a side deal that was just made public yesterday.

Under this legislation, the fossil fuel industry will receive billions of dollars in new tax breaks and subsidies over the next 10 years – on top of the $15 billion in tax breaks and corporate welfare that they already receive every year.

In my view, if we are going to make our planet healthy and habitable for future generations, we cannot provide billions of dollars in new tax breaks to fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet. On the contrary, we should end all of the massive corporate welfare that the fossil fuel industry already enjoys.

Under this legislation, up to 60 million acres of public waters must be offered up for sale each and every year to the oil and gas industry before the federal government could approve any new offshore wind development. To put this in perspective, M. President, 60 million acres is the size of Michigan.

M. President let me read to you the headline that appeared in a July 29th article in Bloomberg: “Exxon Loves What Manchin Did for Big Oil in $370 Billion Deal.”

According to Bloomberg, the CEO of Exxon Mobil called the reconciliation bill “a step in the right direction” and was “pleased” with the “comprehensive set of solutions” included in the reconciliation bill.

Barrons recently reported that Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are just a few of the fossil fuel companies that could benefit the most under this bill.

Now, M. President, if the CEO of Exxon Mobil, a company that has done as much as any to destroy this planet, is “pleased” with this bill, then I think all of us should have some very deep concerns about what is in this legislation.

Further, under this bill, up to 2 million acres of public lands must be offered up for sale each and every year to the oil and gas industry before leases can move forward for any renewable energy development on public lands.

In total, this bill will offer the fossil fuel industry up to 700 million acres of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling over the next decade – far more than the oil and gas industry could possibly use.

And, M. President, that’s not all. The fossil fuel industry will not just benefit from the provisions in the reconciliation bill. A deal has also been reached to make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits for their oil and gas projects.

This deal would approve the $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline – a fracked gas pipeline that would span 303 miles from West Virginia to Virginia, and potentially on to North Carolina.

This is a pipeline that would generate emissions equivalent to that released by 37 coal plants or by over 27 million cars each and every year.

M. President, let me quote a statement from 350.ORG on this subject: “This latest bill has a few good pieces: lengthening the tax credits for green energy projects from two to ten years to ensure steady growth in the wind and solar industry; providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles; and installing heat pumps to make green energy use more widespread. However, the amount of giveaways to the fossil fuel industry is so wide in scope, that it turns all of the gains in addressing the climate crisis into a moot point.”

Here is what the Center for Biological Diversity had to say on this bill: “This is a climate suicide pact.  It’s self-defeating to handcuff renewable energy development to massive new oil and gas extraction. The new leasing required in this bill will fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country, and it’s a slap in the face to the communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels.”

In my view, we have got to do everything possible to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, not give billions of dollars in corporate welfare to an industry that has been destroying our planet.

Tax Reform

Finally, M. President, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality; at a time of soaring corporate profits; and at a time in which we have a broken tax system riddled with all kinds of loopholes for the rich and the powerful, this bill makes a few modest changes to reform the tax code.

Under this bill, corporations will be required to pay a minimum tax of 15%. That is the good news. The American people are sick and tired of companies like AT&T, Federal Express, and Nike making billions of dollars in profits and paying nothing in federal income tax. This provision has been estimated to raise $313 billion over the next decade.

Further, under this bill, the IRS will finally begin to receive the funding that it needs to audit wealthy tax cheats. Each and every year, the top 1 percent are able to avoid paying more than $160 billion in taxes that they legally owe because the IRS does not have the resources they need to conduct audits of the extremely wealthy. This bill begins to change that.

This bill would also make very modest changes to the so-called carried interest loophole that has allowed billionaire hedge fund managers on Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse, teacher, or firefighter.

But the bad news is that this bill does nothing to repeal the Trump tax breaks that went to the very wealthy and large corporations. Trump’s 2017 tax bill provided over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top one percent and large corporations. In fact, 83% of the benefits of the Trump tax law are going to the top 1% – and this bill repeals none of those benefits.

And M. President, let’s not forget. It is very likely that Congress will be doing a so-called tax extenders bill at the end of the year that could provide corporations up to $400 billion over the next decade in new tax breaks. If that occurs, that would more than offset the $313 billion in corporate revenue included in this bill.

So that, M. President is where we are today. We have legislation which unlike the original Build Back Better plan ignores the needs of working families in childcare, Pre-K, the expansion of Medicare, affordable housing, home healthcare, higher education, and many other desperate needs.

This is legislation which, at a time of massive profits for the pharmaceutical industry, and when we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, takes some very modest steps to lower or control the price of medicine.

This is legislation which has some good and important provisions pertaining to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, but, at the same time, provides massive giveaways to the fossil fuel industry whose emissions are destroying the planet.

This is legislation which appropriately ends the absurdity of large, profitable corporations paying nothing in federal income tax but, at the same time, leaves intact virtually all of Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy and very large corporations.

M. President this more than 700-page bill after months of secret negotiations became public late last week. Now is the time for every member of the Senate to study this bill thoroughly and to come up with amendments and suggestions as to how we can improve it.

I look forward to being part of that process.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Questions Why U.S. Must “Join the Club” and Give Blank Checks to Microchip Companies While Ignoring Other Major Issues
Date: July 25, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday, seizing on comments made by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) arguing that the U.S. must join the club and hand over billions of dollars to the microchip industry, said: “As someone who has stood on this floor many times urging this country to look to other countries in terms of what they do with health care, prescription drugs, higher education and parental leave, I find Senator Romney’s statement very curious about needing to ‘join the club’ with other foreign countries.”Sanders went on to list a number of major issues for which the U.S. is decidedly not in the club, including quality affordable health care and paid family and medical leave.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:M. President: I want to say a few words about the so-called “chips” bill that we will be voting on later today and what it says about our priorities, our tax policy and whether or not Congress is capable of representing the needs of the working families of our country or whether we are totally beholden to wealthy and powerful corporate interests.M. President, there is no doubt that there is a global shortage in microchips and semiconductors which is making it harder for manufacturers to produce the cars, cell phones, household appliances and electronic equipment that we need. This shortage is costing American workers good jobs and raising prices for families. That is why I fully support efforts to expand U.S. microchip production.But the question we should be asking is this: Should American taxpayers provide the micro-chip industry with a blank check of over $76 billion at a time when semiconductor companies are making tens of billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages? I think the answer to that question should be a resounding NO.M. President, according to a recent Associated Press article, Senator Romney, reflecting the views I think of many “said that when other countries subsidize the manufacturing of high technology chips, the U.S. must join the club.”‘If you don’t play like they play, then you are not going to be manufacturing high technology chips, and they are essential for our national defense as well as our economy,’ Romney said.”As someone who has stood on this floor many times urging this country to look to other countries in terms of what they do with healthcare, prescription drugs, higher education and parental leave, I find Senator Romney’s statement very curious about needing to “join the club” with other foreign countries.Every other major country on earth guarantees healthcare to all people as a human right. Why aren’t we joining that club?Germany and other countries around the world make public colleges and universities in America tuition free.Every other major country on earth guarantees paid family and medical leave to its workers. Every major country. How come we’re not joining the club of virtually the entire world?So, apparently, M. President, when corporate America needs a blank check of $76 billion we do what other countries are doing. When other countries protect the needs of their workers, their children, their elderly somehow that is not a club we join.M. President: There is a lot of talk about the micro-chip crisis facing this country, but very little talk about how we got to where we are today.So, let’s review some recent history. Over the last 20 years, the micro-chip industry has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants and other establishments in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs while moving most of its production overseas after receiving over $9.5 billion in government subsidies and loans.(Let me give you just a few examples:Between 2010 and 2014, Intel laid off approximately 1,400 workers from the Rio Rancho, New Mexico chip facility and offshored 1,000 jobs to Israel.According to the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industry, Intel laid off more than 1,000 workers in Oregon between 2015 and 2016. They specifically noted that the company was offshoring jobs to Israel and that workers were required to train their replacements in India and Costa Rica before being laid off when their jobs were shipped there.Texas Instruments outsourced 400 jobs from their Houston, Texas manufacturing facility to the Philippines in 2013.Micron Technology has repeatedly cut jobs in Boise, Idaho, including 1,100 in 2003, another 1,100 in 2007, and 1,500 in 2008. In 2009, the company stopped manufacturing some types of chips entirely and laid off 2,000 workers.)In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies took government money and used it to ship good-paying jobs abroad. Now, as a reward for causing this crisis, these same companies are in line to receive a massive taxpayer handout to undo the damage that they did. That is simply unacceptable.In total, it has been estimated that 5 major semi-conductor companies will receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Foundries, and Samsung. These 5 companies made $70 billion in profits last year.The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer assistance is Intel.In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits. During the pandemic, Intel had enough money to spend $16.6 billion, not on research and development, not in building new plants in America, but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy shareholders. So here is the absurd moment that we are at. It is estimated that Intel will receive between $20 and $30 billion in federal funding with no strings attached in order to build new plants. And yet, within the last several years, this same company spent over $16 billion on stock buybacks. And there is no guarantee in this bill that they will not continue to do stock buybacks.Over the past 20 years, Intel spent over $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. That’s a heck of an investment. For $100 million in lobbying and campaign contributions you receive at least $20 billion in corporate welfare. Not a bad deal.M. President: A little over a week ago, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, did an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box. And I think it tells us everything we want to know about oligarchy, arrogance and the state of American politics.And this is what Mr. Gelsinger said:“My message to congressional leaders is ‘Hey, if I’m not done with the job, I don’t get to go home. Neither should you. Do not go home for August recess until you have passed the chips act. Because I and others in the industry will make investment decisions. And do you want those investments in the US or are we simply not competitive enough to do them here and we need to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get the job done. Do not go home for August recess without getting these bills passed.”M. President, let’s be clear. The CEO of Intel received a $179 million compensation package last year. And now what he is saying is that if you don’t give my industry a $76 billion blank check and my company up to $30 billion, despite our profound love for our country and our love of American workers and the needs of the military we are prepared to go to Europe or Asia where we may be able to make even more money.M. President: As I said last week, I am, thankfully, not a lawyer, but that sure sounds like extortion to me. But Mr. Gelsinger’s words sure sound like extortion to me. What he is saying is that if you don’t give his industry $76 billion in corporate welfare, despite the needs of the military for advanced microchips, despite the needs of the medical industry for advanced microchips, despite the needs of our entire economy for advanced microchips, he is threatening to abandon America and move abroad.Well, I have a few questions for Mr. Gelsinger and the other micro-chip CEOs:If Intel and the others receive a corporate welfare check from the taxpayers of America are they willing to commit today that their companies will not outsource American jobs overseas?If this legislation passes, will Intel and the others commit today that they will not spend another penny on stock buybacks to enrich wealthy shareholders but will instead spend the lion’s share of their profits to create jobs in the United States of America?If this legislation goes into effect, will Intel and the others commit today that they will stay neutral in any union organizing campaign like the one being waged at Intel’s micro-chip plant in Hillsboro, Oregon?If this legislation goes into effect, will Intel and the others commit today that they are prepared to issue warrants to the federal government so that the taxpayers of America get a reasonable return on their investments?M. President, if Intel and the others were prepared to say “yes” to any of these questions they would not be lobbying against my amendment to impose these conditions to the CHIPS Act. And that, to my mind, is absolutely unacceptable.Further, I say to my colleagues who claim that this bill is supposed to make us “more competitive” with China, guess what?Since 2008, Intel has invested at least $700 million in tech companies in China including two Chinese semi-conductor start-ups Pro-Plus and Spectrum Materials.Now, Mr. Gelsinger says the Senate should stay in, if necessary, through August to get the job done. Well, I agree. We should make sure we get the job done.But what I hear from people in Vermont and around the country is that the job they want done is not a massive handout to large, profitable corporations. The job they want done is to guarantee healthcare to all Americans as a human right and to significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs.The job they want done is to end the absurdity of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave.The job they want done is to have the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and for us to address the existential threat of climate change.The job they want done is to raise the minimum wage to a living wage and to increase Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled.The job they want done is to protect a woman’s right to control her own body, pass meaningful gun safety legislation and protect the rights of the American people to vote.That’s what I hear as to what the American people want, not more corporate welfare for profitable corporations with no strings attached.And, by the way, let me give you another way we could expend $76 billion.For $76 billion we could expand Medicare to provide senior citizens with the high-quality hearing aids and eyeglasses that they desperately need. And for a bit more we could provide dental care as well.For $76 billion we could eliminate homelessness in America and create good-paying jobs from Maine to California building hundreds of thousands of affordable rental units.For $76 billion we could make every community college in America tuition free for the next seven years.And on and on it goes.At a time when the working families of this country are falling further and further behind while the very rich are getting much richer, let us get our priorities right.And, M. President, let me be clear. Intel is not alone.Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this legislation is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good-paying American jobs to low-wage countries.Who else is in line to receive corporate welfare under this bill?Well, how about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)? It is in line to potentially receive billions of dollars in federal grants under this bill.M. President: Guess who the largest shareholder of TSMC is? Well, if you guessed the Government of Taiwan you would be correct – which should come as no surprise to anybody who studies how other countries throughout the world conduct industrial policy.So let’s be clear: When we provide TSMC money, we are giving that taxpayer money directly to the Government of Taiwan.Samsung, another very large corporate entity from South Korea is also in line to receive federal funding under this bill.In other words, not only would this bill be providing corporate welfare to profitable American corporations, but we would literally be handing over U.S. taxpayer dollars to corporations that are owned or controlled by other countries.And on and on it goes.M. President: Let me be clear. I believe in industrial policy. I believe that it makes sense, in certain occasions, for the government and the private sector to work together to address a pressing need in America.Industrial policy to me means cooperation between the government and the private sector. Cooperation. It does not mean the government providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to profitable corporations without getting anything in return.M. President: The question is will the United States government develop an industrial policy that benefits all of our society, or will we continue to have an industrial policy that benefits the wealthy and the powerful?M. President: In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: “The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.”I am afraid what Dr. King said 54 years ago was accurate back then and it is even more accurate today.We have heard a lot of talk in the halls of Congress about the need to create public-private partnerships – and that all sounds very good. But when the government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all of the risk and privatizes all of the profits that’s not a partnership. That is crony capitalism.If private companies are going to benefit from generous taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders. In other words, if micro-chip companies make a profit as a direct result of these federal grants, the taxpayers of this country have a right to get a reasonable return on that investment.Further, if micro-chip companies receive taxpayer assistance, they must agree that they will not buy back their own stock, outsource American jobs overseas, repeal existing collective bargaining agreements and must remain neutral in any union organizing effort.This is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were imposed on companies that received taxpayer assistance during the pandemic and passed the Senate by a vote of 96-0.That’s why I have filed an amendment with Senator Warren that would impose these conditions to this legislation.Now, I understand, M. President, that some of my colleagues have said: Don’t worry. We have imposed “strong guardrails” to this bill.Well, M. President, let me respectfully disagree. These so-called guardrails would do nothing to prevent micro-chip companies from outsourcing a single job abroad. In fact, these so-called guard-rails would not even force Intel to divest all of the money they have put into semi-conductor companies in China.These so-called guardrails would do nothing to protect taxpayers or to stop micro-chip companies from union busting.Yes, M. President. I understand some language has been inserted into this bill that would prohibit micro-chip companies from using federal grants to buy back their own stock, but let’s be clear. This language is totally meaningless. Under this legislation, companies will still be able to use the enormous profits they are making on stock buybacks.Bottom line: Let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry, but let’s do it in a way that benefits all of our society, not just a handful of wealthy, profitable and powerful corporations.I ask my colleagues to vote against invoking cloture on this bill later today.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Files Amendment on Microchip Legislation to Restrict Blank Check Corporate Welfare
Date: July 19, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday delivered remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate to object to the blank check in billions of taxpayer dollars currently slated for a handful of wealthy companies and file an amendment to impose conditions on these corporate giveaways.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below and can be watchedhere:

I object.

Senator Lee raises very serious issues about the deficit. I hope very much that he will be able to convince his Republican colleagues that, among many other reasons, they should vote against the corporate welfare bill for the micro-chip industry which will add at least $76 billion to the deficit.

In my view, it’s not good enough to tell us that you worry about the deficit when it comes to addressing the needs of working families or the elderly or the children or the sick and the poor.

You might want to worry about the deficit when you’re giving huge amounts of corporate welfare to very large and profitable corporations.

M. President: I want to say a few words about this so-called chips bill and what it says about our priorities, our tax policy and whether or not Congress is capable of representing the needs of the working families of our country or whether we are totally beholden to wealthy and powerful corporate interests.

Last week, when I spoke about this issue I expressed outrage that Congress would give $52 billion to a handful of profitable corporations in the micro-chip industry. Well, I stand corrected. As a result of some new tax reduction language, the corporate welfare total for the industry is now at $76 billion and the corporate lobbyists working on this bill, like pigs at the trough, are not yet finished they want even more.

M. President, needless to say, I do not usually quote approvingly from the Wall Street Journal editorial page which it seems attacks me personally every week. But, as you know, a broken clock is right twice a day and even the Wall Street Journal got this one right. Among the many reasons they urge Congress to vote against this bill is one that I think is very relevant and let me quote:

“The chip bill isn’t needed to compete with China, and it will set a precedent that other industries will follow. Anybody who can throw up a China competition angle will ask for money. Why Republicans want to sign up for this is a mystery…”

M. President: I recently came across an extremely interesting interview that the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, did last Friday on CNBC’s Squawk Box. And I think it tells us everything we want to know about oligarchy, arrogance and the state of American politics.

And this is what Mr. Gelsinger said:

“My message to congressional leaders is ‘Hey, if I’m not done with the job, I don’t get to go home. Neither should you. Do not go home for August recess until you have passed the chips act. Because I and others in the industry will make investment decisions. And do you want those investments in the US or are we simply not competitive enough to do them here and we need to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get the job done. Do not go home for August recess without getting these bills passed.”

In other words, M. President, the CEO of a major corporation which made nearly $20 billion in profits last year and who received a $179 million compensation package is saying to Congress that if you don’t give my industry $76 billion and my company some $20 to $30 billion, despite our profound love for our country and our love of American workers and the needs of the military we are prepared to go to Europe or Asia where we may be able to make even more money.

M. President: I’m not a lawyer, but that sure sounds like extortion to me. What Mr. Gelsinger is saying is that if you don’t give us a blank check, despite the needs of the military for advanced microchips, despite the needs of the medical industry for advanced microchips, despite the needs of our entire economy for advanced microchips, he is threatening to abandon America and move abroad.

Mr. Gelsinger says we should stay in, if necessary, through August to get the job done. Well, I agree. We should make sure we get the job done. But what I hear from people in Vermont and around the country is that the job they want done is not a massive handout to large, profitable corporations. The job they want done is to guarantee healthcare to all Americans as a human right and to significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs,

The job they want done is to end the absurdity of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave.

The job they want done is to have the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and for us to address the existential threat of climate CHANGE.

The job they want done is to raise the minimum wage to a living wage and to increase Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled.

The job they want done is to protect a woman’s right to control her own body, pass meaningful gun safety legislation and protect the rights of the American people to vote.

That’s what I hear as to what the American people want, not more corporate welfare for profitable corporations with no strings attached.

And, by the way, let me give you another way we could expend $76 billion.

For $76 billion we could expand Medicare to provide senior citizens with the high-quality hearing aids and eyeglasses that they desperately need. And for a bit more we could provide dental care as well.

For $76 billion we could eliminate homelessness in America and create good-paying jobs from Maine to California building hundreds of thousands of affordable rental units.

For $76 billion we could make every community college in America tuition free for the next seven years.

And on and on it goes.

At a time when the working families of this country are falling further and further behind while the very rich are getting much richer, let us get our priorities right.

M. President, there is no doubt that there is a global shortage in microchips and semiconductors which is making it harder for manufacturers to produce the cars, cell phones and electronic equipment that we need. This shortage is costing American workers good jobs and raising prices for families. That is why I fully support efforts to expand U.S. microchip production.

But the question we should be asking is this: Should American taxpayers provide the micro-chip industry with a blank check of over $76 billion at a time when semiconductor companies are making tens of billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages? I think the answer to that question should be a resounding NO.

Let’s review some recent history. Over the last 20 years, the micro-chip industry has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs while moving most of its production overseas after receiving over $9.5 billion in government subsidies and loans.

In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies took government money and used it to ship good-paying jobs abroad. Now, as a reward for that bad behavior, these same companies are in line to receive a massive taxpayer handout to undo the damage that they did. That may make sense to someone. It does not make sense to me.

In total, it has been estimated that 5 major semi-conductor companies will receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Foundries, and Samsung. These 5 companies made $70 billion in profits last year.

The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer assistance is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I wish them well. But, let’s be clear. Intel is not a poor company. It is not going broke.

In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits. During the pandemic, Intel had enough money to spend $16.6 billion, not on research and development, but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy shareholders.

Over the past 20 years, Intel spent over $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions while shipping thousands of jobs to China and other low-income countries. Does it sound like this company really needs corporate welfare?

Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this legislation is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good-paying American jobs to low-wage countries.

Who else is in line to receive corporate welfare under this bill?

Well, how about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)? It is in line to potentially receive billions of dollars in federal grants under this bill.

M. President: Guess who the largest shareholder of TSMC is? Well, if you guessed the Government of Taiwan you would be correct – which should come as no surprise to anybody who studies how other countries throughout the world conduct industrial policy.

So let’s be clear: When we provide TSMC money, we are giving that taxpayer money directly to the Government of Taiwan.Samsung, another very large corporate entity from South Korea is also in line to receive federal funding under this bill.

In other words, not only would this bill be providing corporate welfare to profitable American corporations, but we would literally be handing over U.S. taxpayer dollars to corporations that are owned or controlled by other countries.

And on and on it goes.

M. President: Let me be clear. I believe in industrial policy. I believe that it makes sense, in certain occasions, for the government and the private sector to work together to address a pressing need in America.

Industrial policy to me means cooperation between the government and the private sector. Cooperation. It does not mean the government providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to profitable corporations without getting anything in return.

M. President: The question is will the United States government develop an industrial policy that benefits all of our society, or will we continue to have an industrial policy that benefits the wealthy and the powerful?

M. President: In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: “The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.”

I am afraid what Dr. King said 54 years ago was accurate back then and it is even more accurate today.

We have heard a lot of talk in the halls of Congress about the need to create public-private partnerships – and that all sounds very good. But when the government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all of the risk and privatizes all of the profits that’s not a partnership. That is crony capitalism.

Some of my colleagues make the point that the microchip industry is enormously important for our economy and that we must become less dependent on foreign nations for micro-chips. I agree. There is no argument about that. But we can and must accomplish that goal without simply throwing money at these companies while the taxpayer gets nothing in return.

In my view, we must prevent microchip companies from receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue warrants or equity stakes to the Federal Government.

If private companies are going to benefit from generous taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders. In other words, if micro-chip companies make a profit as a direct result of these federal grants, the taxpayers of this country have a right to get a reasonable return on that investment.

Further, if micro-chip companies receive taxpayer assistance, they must agree that they will not buy back their own stock, outsource American jobs overseas, repeal existing collective bargaining agreements and must remain neutral in any union organizing effort.

This is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were imposed on companies that received taxpayer assistance during the pandemic and passed the Senate by a vote of 96-0.

That’s why I will be filing an amendment to impose these conditions to this legislation.

Now, I understand, M. President, that some language has been inserted into this bill that would prohibit micro-chip companies from using these grants to buy back their own stock, but let’s be clear. This language is totally meaningless. Under this legislation, companies will still be able to use the enormous profits they are making on stock buybacks.

Bottom line: Let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry, but let’s do it in a way that benefits all of our society, not just a handful of wealthy, profitable and powerful corporations.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Opposes All Blank Checks to Chip Companies
Date: July 15, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., July 15 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday issued the following statement as Congress tries to hand a $53 billion blank check to profitable  microchip and semiconductor companies:

“There is no debate that the microchip and semiconductor shortage is a dire threat to our nation. It is costing American workers good paying jobs and raising prices for families. It is making it harder for businesses to manufacture cars, cellphones and life-saving medical equipment. It is also putting our national security at risk.

“The microchip industry helped cause this crisis by, over the last 20 years, shutting down 780 plants here and eliminating 150,000 good-paying jobs. The question before us now is whether these extremely profitable companies will work with the U.S. government on a solution to rebuild the U.S. microchip industry which is fair to the taxpayers of this country, or whether they will continue to demand a $53 billion bribe to stay here. That is the main issue involved in the debate over the Chip legislation which may be on the floor of the Senate as early as next week.

“What I cannot understand is why so many in Congress are so eager to pay this bribe. When the government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all the risk and privatizes all the profits, that is crony capitalism. The five biggest semi-conductor companies that will likely receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout, Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Foundries and Samsung, made $70 billion in profits last year. Does it sound like these companies really need corporate welfare?

“I’m opposed to this legislation in any form until these conditions are met: companies must agree to issue warrants or equity stakes to the federal government; they must commit to not buying back their own stock, outsourcing American jobs overseas or repealing existing collective bargaining agreements; and they must remain neutral in any union organizing efforts. The demands I’m making are not radical. They are the same conditions that were included in the CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96-0.

“Let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry, but let’s do it in a way that benefits all of our society, not just a handful of wealthy, profitable and powerful corporations.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Slams Corporate Giveaways in Microchip Legislation
Date: July 13, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, July 13 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday on the floor of the U.S. Senate called for the USICA conference committee to not approve the billions in corporate giveaways slated for a handful of wealthy and powerful microchip companies, including a $10 billion bailout for Jeff Bezos to fly to the moon.

Sanders’remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.

M. President: At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are sick and they are tired of the unprecedented level of corporate greed that is taking place from one end of this country to the next.

They are sick and tired of paying outrageously high prices at the gas pump and at the grocery store while the oil companies and the food companies are seeing profits at an all-time high.

They are sick and they are tired of struggling to pay for the basic necessities of life while 700 billionaires in our country became $2 trillion richer during the pandemic.

They are sick and tired of CEOs making 350 times more than the average worker, while over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck.

They are sick and they are tired of seeing multi-billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson taking joy rides to outer space, buying $500 million super-yachts and living in mansions with 25 bathrooms when some 600,000 people are homeless in America.

They want Congress to address corporate greed and make sure that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes.

M. President, the last poll that I saw had Congress with a 16% approval rating. This to me is shocking, really shocking. And I suspect it has to do with the fact that the 16% are not yet fully aware of what Congress is doing.

So what is Congress doing? For nearly two months, a 107-member conference committee has been meeting behind closed doors to provide over $50 billion in corporate welfare with no strings attached to the highly profitable micro-chip industry.

And yes, if you can believe it, this legislation may also provide a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos so that his company Blue Origin can launch a rocket ship to the moon.

M. President: For all of my friends who tell us how concerned they are about the deficit, how we cannot fund the needs of our children, how we can’t fund the needs of our seniors, a $53 billion blank check to some of the most profitable corporations in America and a $10 billion bailout to the second wealthiest person in our country is an absolute outrage. It is why the American people today have such low regard for Congress.

M. President, there is no doubt that there is a global shortage in microchips and semiconductors which is making it harder for manufacturers to produce the cars, cell phones and electronic equipment that we need. This shortage is costing American workers good jobs and raising prices for families. That is why I fully support efforts to expand U.S. microchip production.

But the question we should be asking is this: Should American taxpayers provide the micro-chip industry with a blank check of over $50 billion at a time when semiconductor companies are making tens of billions of dollars in profits and paying their executives exorbitant compensation packages? I think the answer to that question should be a resounding NO.

Let’s review some recent history. Over the last 20 years, the micro-chip industry has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs while moving most of its production overseas after receiving over $9.5 billion in government subsidies and loans.

In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies took government money and used it to ship good-paying jobs abroad. Now, as a reward for that bad behavior, these same companies are in line to receive a massive taxpayer handout to undo the damage that they did. That may make sense to someone. It does not make sense to me.

In total, it has been estimated that 5 major semi-conductor companies will receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Foundries, and Samsung. These 5 companies made $70 billion in profits last year.

The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer assistance is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I wish them well. But, let’s be clear. Intel is not a poor company. It is not going broke.

In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits. During the pandemic, Intel had enough money to spend $16.6 billion, not on research and development, but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy shareholders.

Last year, Intel could afford to give its CEO, Pat Gelsinger, a $179 million compensation package. Over the past 20 years, Intel spent over $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions while shipping thousands of jobs to China and other low-income countries. Does it sound like this company really needs corporate welfare?

Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this legislation is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good-paying American jobs to low-wage countries.

Who else is in line to receive corporate welfare under this bill?

Well, how about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)? It is in line to potentially receive billions of dollars in federal grants under this bill.

M. President: Guess who the largest shareholder of TSMC is? Well, if you guessed the Government of Taiwan you would be correct – which should come as no surprise to anybody who studies how other countries throughout the world conduct industrial policy.

So let’s be clear: When we provide TSMC money, we are giving that taxpayer money directly to the Government of Taiwan.

Samsung, another very large corporate entity from South Korea is also in line to receive federal funding under this bill.

In other words, not only would this bill be providing corporate welfare to profitable American corporations, but we would literally be handing over U.S. taxpayer dollars to corporations that are owned or controlled by other countries.

And on and on it goes.

M. President: Let me be clear. I believe in industrial policy. I believe that it makes sense, in certain occasions, for the government and the private sector to work together to address a pressing need in America.

Industrial policy to me means cooperation between the government and the private sector. Cooperation. It does not mean the government providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to profitable corporations without getting anything in return.

M. President: The question is will the United States government develop an industrial policy that benefits all of our society, or will we continue to have an industrial policy that benefits the wealthy and the powerful?

Bottom line: Let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry, but let’s do it in a way that benefits all of our society, not just a handful of wealthy, profitable and powerful corporations.

Moreover, M. President, I know this may be a radical idea in the halls of Congress, but no. I do not believe that the USICA conference committee should approve a $10 billion bailout for Jeff Bezos to fly to the moon. If Mr. Bezos wants to go to the moon, good for him. He has $138 billion in personal wealth. He became $33 billion richer during the pandemic. He is the second richest person in America. And, in a given year, Mr. Bezos has paid nothing in federal income taxes.

If he wants to go to the moon, let him use his own money, not U.S. taxpayers. The House did the right thing by not providing Jeff Bezos with a $10 billion bailout in its version of USICA. The conference committee should follow the House’s lead on that issue. I yield the floor.

WASHINGTON, June 29 – As skyrocketing flight delays, cancellations, and outrageously high prices and hidden fees are leaving passengers and crew members frustrated, broke, and stranded, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg urging immediate action to protect the rights of airline passengers and workers.Sanders wrote, “Let’s be clear. During the pandemic, when air travel came to a near halt, U.S. taxpayers came to the rescue and gave $54 billion to the airline industry. The top eight airlines alone received nearly $50 billion in taxpayer assistance from the federal government. Given all of the generous taxpayer support that has been provided to the airline industry, all of us have a responsibility to make sure that passengers and crew members are treated with respect, not contempt.”In the letter, Sanders lays out specific and urgent steps Sec. Buttigieg should take to protect passengers and crew members and substantially reduce cancellations and delays, including requiring airlines to promptly refund passengers for flights that have been delayed over an hour; imposing fines on airlines for flights that are delayed more than two hours; and imposing fines on airlines for scheduling flights that they are unable to properly staff.Over the past year, the price of airline tickets has climbed by 38 percent, while airline delays have increased by 50 percent and cancellations are up by 18 percent compared to where they were before the pandemic. So far this year, one out of every five flights in the U.S. were delayed.The letter comes at a time when many pilots, flight attendants, and airline workers are also picketing and followsrecent allegationsfrom the American Airlines pilots’ union that airlines are intentionally scheduling flights they cannot staff.Read the letterhere.

Friday sent a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy urging him to drop the company’s objections to the historic union election on Staten Island before a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) hearing on Monday and finally recognize the Amazon Labor Union.“If Amazon can afford to spend $10 billion in stock buybacks to enrich its wealthy shareholders and executives—including the second richest person in the world, Jeff Bezos—it can afford a unionized workforce,” the senators wrote. “If Amazon can spend over $4 million in a single year on union-busting and $213 million on your compensation, it can afford a workforce that can collectively bargain for better wages, better benefits, safer working conditions, and reliable schedules…We strongly urge you to respect the will of Amazon workers by dropping your objections, recognizing the Amazon Labor Union and negotiating in good faith before the NLRB hearing on June 13th. It is time for Amazon to end its blatant disregard of labor law and treat workers with the respect and dignity they deserve.”Since the workers on Staten Island became the first-ever Amazon warehouse to successfully vote to form a union in the United States, Amazon has refused to negotiate a first contract, refused to recognize that the union exists, and filed 25 objections to the election – despite the NLRB certifying the victory.Last year, Amazon increased its profits by 75 percent to a record-breaking $35 billion while avoiding over $5 billion in taxes and while spending$4.3 millionon union-busting consultants and lawyers. Amazon has also been penalized more than $75 million for breaking federal discrimination and wage laws and is currently being sued by the NLRB to reinstate a worker who was illegally fired for organizing a union.Amazon is waging a war against workers’ right to unionize – from forcing workers to attend anti-union meetings, to threatening to slash wages and benefits if workers form a union – and there are currently 51 open Unfair Labor Practice cases against Amazon pending before the NLRB.Read the full letter,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Baldwin Lead Letter in Support of Striking CNH Industrial Workers in Wisconsin and Iowa

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 9 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), along with their colleagues Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Tuesday sent aletterto CNH Industrial’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Wine expressing support for over 1,000 UAW workers currently on strike in Racine, Wisconsin and Burlington, Iowa demanding the company negotiate a fair contract in good faith.“Let’s be clear. CNH is not a poor company,” the senators wrote. “It is not going broke. Last year, CNH made over $1.7 billion in profits. If CNH can afford to provide you with a $9.2 million signing bonus and nearly $22 million in total compensation for one year of work – nearly 8,000 times the raise you are offering some workers – it can afford to pay all of your workers better wages and better benefits. If CNH can afford to spend over $100 million on stock buybacks over a six-month period to enrich its wealthy shareholders, it can afford to treat all of its workers with the dignity and the respect that they deserve.”The workers, who make agriculture and construction equipment, went on strike in early May for better wages, cost of living adjustments, improved health benefits, and fair and safe work rules. Regularly working 12-hour days and nearly 60-hour weeks, the workers also work up to 17 hours per week of forced overtime. The company, which made over $1.7 billion in profits last year, proposed unaffordable health benefits and an average annual raise of just $1.33 per hour for the lowest paid workers – resulting in a substantial pay cut for many after adjusting for inflation and the massive new health benefit costs.The senators demanded Wine go back to the bargaining table, negotiate in good faith for a fair contract, and end the union busting activities immediately.“Mr. Wine: Our request is simple and it is straightforward,” wrote the senators. “Go back to the bargaining table. Negotiate in good faith. Stop hiring replacement workers. Give back the health insurance benefits that you took away from striking workers. Offer your workers a contract that is fair and that is just.”The CNH workers strike comes amidst a wave of worker protests across industries and states, includingat least185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021, and at least 130 strikes at 190 locations in 2022 so far.Sanders recently called on President Biden tofulfillhis campaign promise to prevent companies engaged in illegal anti-union activities from receiving federal contracts paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Along with the CNH strike, Sanders has rallied support for workers across the country, includingKellogg’s workersin Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee;bakery workersin California; Warrior Metcoal minersin Alabama,steelworkersin West Virginia; UVM Medical Centerresidentsin Vermont; and more than 30,000Kaiserhealth care workers; as well as workers atJohn Deere,Starbucks,McDonald’s,Frito-Lay,TeamstersHunts Point Market,GSOCUAWgraduate workers at NYU,Churchill Downs, and more.Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Warren, and Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Expand Social Security by $2,400 a Year and Extend Solvency for 75 Years
Date: June 9, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 9 – Senate Co-Chairs of the Expand Social Security Caucus Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday – joined by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), with Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) introducing companion legislation in the House – introduced legislation that would expand Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year and fully fund it for the next 75 years past the year 2096 – all without raising taxes by one penny on over 93 percent of American households.

These estimates reflect an analysis of the legislation conducted by the Social Security Administration on the request of Sen. Sanders and Rep. DeFazio. The analysis was also releasedtodayin a letter from Chief Actuary Stephen Goss.

This follows the recent release of an annualreportby the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that showed Social Security currently has a $2.85 trillion surplus and can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible recipient until the year 2035.

“At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and millions of senior citizens are living in poverty, our job is not to cut Social Security,” said Sen. Sanders. “Our job must be to expand Social Security so that every senior citizen in America can retire with the dignity they deserve and every person with a disability can live with the security they need. And we will do that by demanding that the wealthiest people in America finally pay their fair share of taxes. It is absurd that a billionaire in America today pays the same amount of Social Security taxes as someone making $147,000 a year. It is time to scrap the cap, expand benefits, and fully fund Social Security. I am very proud that the Social Security Administration has estimated that our legislation to expand Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year will fully fund Social Security for the next 75 years by applying the payroll tax on all income – including capital gains – above $250,000 a year.”

“Social Security is an economic lifeline for millions of Americans, but many seniors are struggling with rising costs,” said Sen. Warren. “As Republicans try to phase out Social Security and raise taxes on more than 70 million hardworking Americans, I’m working with Senator Sanders to expand Social Security and extend its solvency by making the wealthy pay their fair share, so everyone can retire with dignity.”

“As a trained gerontologist, I have devoted my career to protecting and expanding programs that are vital to seniors,” said Rep. DeFazio. “One of my highest priorities is protecting Social Security, which millions of Americans rely on, including hundreds of thousands of Oregonians. With the cost of living at an all-time high, Social Security has never been more important, yet Congressional Republicans continue to play games with its funding. This legislation would ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund remains solvent for another 75 years, increase monthly benefits for most recipients by $200, and alter the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) formula to meet the everyday needs of our nation’s seniors.”

Signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Social Security today remains one of the most popular and successful government programs in the history of the United States. Before it was enacted in 1935, more than half of the nation’s seniors lived in poverty, as well as countless Americans living with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers.

More than 80 years later, the nation’s senior poverty rate is just 8.9 percent with Social Security providing an essential lifeline to the one in seven seniors who rely on the program for more than 90 percent of their income – as well as the estimated 50 percent of Americans, 55-years-old and older, living without retirement savings. In 2020 alone, during the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 16 million seniors.

By requiring millionaires and billionaires to finally pay their fair share into the program, the Social Security Expansion Act would build upon and strengthen that legacy. In addition to ensuring solvency to the end of the century, this legislation would help low-income workers stay out of poverty by improving the Special Minimum Benefit, restore student benefits up to age 22 for children of disabled or deceased workers, strengthen benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities, increase Cost-Of-Living-Adjustments (COLAs), and expand program benefits across-the-board.

“Social Security is an enduring feature of American life – throughout its over 80 year history, the program has provided millions of American seniors and people with disabilities with financial security,” said Sen. Booker. “To continue the success of Social Security, our nation must expand the program and extend its solvency to ensure workers can rely on these benefits for generations to come. This bill would make critical reforms to the program, increasing benefits paid out each month and more accurately measuring cost of living adjustments over time. In addition to these reforms, the legislation would also extend the solvency of Social Security for 75 years by closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans.”

“Social Security touches the lives of every American, directly or indirectly. It impacts the lives of older Americans, people with disabilities, and wounded warriors. We must not only protect our Social Security system, we must strengthen and expand it,” said Sen. Gillibrand. “In 2020, Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 16 million older adults. We have to make sure that it’s giving retirees and their families the support they need – and the support they spent their entire lives earning. For so many retirees and their families all over the state of New York, and all over the country, Social Security is truly a matter of survival. Social Security is essential, and it’s something that I will do everything in my power to protect and strengthen.”

“Social Security has provided financial security for older Americans and disabled workers for nearly 90 years, and these days we’re seeing just how crucial it is,” said Sen. Merkley. “As costs of living continue to rise, more and more seniors who rely on Social Security find themselves struggling to afford their basic living expenses, including housing, prescription drugs, food and transportation. We need to increase benefits and strengthen the trust fund, and this bill does both. I look forward to working with my colleagues to expand these important benefits that older Americans have earned through their lifetimes of hard work.”

“For decades, Americans have depended on the Social Security benefits they’ve earned,” said Sen. Van Hollen. “Yet this vital program has been under attack, threatening working families’ financial security. We’ve got to fight to protect it and to ensure Americans can rely on it for years to come. That’s why I’m joining Senator Sanders to introduce this legislation to shore up Social Security and provide the certainty folks deserve.”

“American workers pay into Social Security on the sacred promise of protection if disability strikes and a dignified retirement in their golden years. We need to make good on that promise,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “This bill delivers for seniors by expanding benefits to cover rising costs and ensuring the long-term solvency of the program.”

“Social Security is critical to the livelihoods of millions of Californians. We must strengthen and expand Social Security to ensure that more Americans can live and retire with dignity,” said Senator Padilla. “I am supporting the Social Security Expansion Act because it will increase benefits, make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, and keep the program strong for current and future beneficiaries.”

More than 15 members cosponsored Rep. DeFazio’s companion legislation in the House, including Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-N.J.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alma Adams (D-N.C.), Chuy García (D-Ill.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-D.C.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)

The Social Security Expansion Act has also garnered the support of more than 50 major organizations, including the AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Social Security Works, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), National Education Association, United Electrical, Radio, & Machine Workers of America (UE), and the Economic Policy Institute.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Chairman Sanders to Hold Budget Committee Hearing on Saving and Expanding Social Security
Date: June 3, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, June 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, announced today that the committee will hold a hearing Thursday, June 9, at 11:00 a.m. titled “Saving Social Security: Expanding Benefits and Demanding the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share or Cutting Benefits and Increasing Retirement Anxiety.”

Signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Social Security today remains one of the most popular and successful government programs in the history of the United States. Before it was enacted in 1935, more than half of the nation’s seniors lived in poverty, as well as countless Americans living with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers.

More than 80 years later, the nation’s senior poverty rate is just 8.9 percent with Social Security providing an essential lifeline to the 1 in 7 seniors who rely on the program for more than 90 percent of their income – as well as the estimated 50 percent of Americans, 55-years-old and older, living without retirement savings. In 2020 alone, during the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 16 million seniors.

“At a time when half of Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to save and expand Social Security by making the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes,”said Sanders.“In the richest country in the history of the world, no senior should live in poverty and every American should be able to retire in dignity after a lifetime of hard work. This is not a radical idea.”

Despite Republican claims to the contrary, Social Security is not going broke. According to an annualreportreleased today by the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, Social Security has a $2.85 trillion surplus and can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible recipient until the year 2035. After that, Social Security can pay out 80 percent of benefits owed to every eligible American and, if we demand that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes, we can both extend the solvency of Social Security and expand benefits.

Testifying at the hearing will be Nancy Altman, Robert Roach, Alex Lawson, Maya MacGuineas, and Stephen Goss. Additional witnesses to be determined.

Title: Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Phil Scott Announce $4.23 Million in Grants for Afterschool and Summer Programs
Date: May 19, 2022

Montpelier, Vt. – Governor Phil Scott and Senator Bernie Sanders, in partnership with Vermont Afterschool, today announced the recipients of the Afterschool & Summer Expanding Access Grant program for the summers of 2022 and 2023 and the 2022–2023 school year.

A total of $4.23 million was awarded to 39 programs from 11 Vermont counties. Building off the successful 2021Summer Matters grant initiativeand the progress Vermont has made toward offering universal afterschool and summer programs, the Expanding Access Grants will continue to reduce gaps in Vermont’s current summer and afterschool system by addressing affordability, increasing availability, building long-lasting partnerships to promote sustainability, and piloting innovative approaches.

“I’m encouraged by the outpouring of interest from programs who want to serve more youth and families in their communities,”said Governor Scott. “Ensuring all Vermont youth have access to engaging afterschool and summer programs is a top priority, and we’ll continue our work moving this forward. I’m grateful to Senator Sanders and Vermont Afterschool for their continued partnership.”

The grants, funded by federal dollars secured by Senator Sanders, were awarded to a variety of programs, including summer camps, libraries, municipalities, teen centers, non-profit social services organizations and more, to expand the number of weeks and slots, as well as to increase affordability and accessibility of summer and afterschool programs.

“After more than two years of this terrible pandemic, it is no secret that young people in particular have faced struggles that we are only beginning to understand,”said Sen. Sanders.“Now more than ever, young Vermonters need and deserve to have summer opportunities that are both fun and enriching. I am glad to have worked in partnership with Governor Scott on these programs since I first included funding for summer and afterschool funding in the federal COVID response legislation in 2020. It is good news that we are building off the progress we have made toward reaching universal afterschool and summer programs for all Vermont students, regardless of income. By making their programs free or low-cost, addressing transportation needs, and finding opportunities for older students – like expanded employment options – these grantees are tackling the major barriers faced by so many working Vermont families during the summer months. I thank each and every one of the people who have worked to make today possible and look forward to seeing all you are able to do this summer.”

“Vermont’s afterschool and summer programs play a critical role in the well-being of Vermont’s children and youth, creating opportunities for them to engage, connect, learn, and grow,”said Nicole Miller, Interim Director of Vermont Afterschool.“These programs offer not only a lifeline for working families and caregivers on whom Vermont’s business and economy rely, but also to children and youth, who gain additional supports to emerge from the pandemic strong, resilient, and hopeful. We have no doubt that the programs awarded grant funds will make a strong impact on the lives of Vermont’s children and youth.”

The Expanding Access Grant process was highly competitive with 144 proposals submitted totaling $14.1 million in requests. These proposals, which far exceeded available funds, highlight the extensive and ongoing need for affordable programs to serve Vermont youth. In total, grant funds will help create 1099 new summer 2022 & 2023 program slots and 790 new afterschool program slots. Grant funding will lead to a total of 389 new weeks of summer and afterschool programming, with 30 programs addressing affordability and 21 programs offering programming in underserved areas of the state.

Additionally, 37 are increasing inclusivity for all youth, by ensuring those from low-income backgrounds, youth of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) youth, English learners, youth with disabilities and/or special needs, migratory youth, rural youth, youth in foster care and youth experiencing homelessness are well-represented in the mix of youth participating in programs and have the needed resources to fully participate.

Each proposal was peer-reviewed by a pool of reviewers who represented national organizations, 15 states, and who had experience in afterschool and summer learning; youth development; diversity, equity, and inclusion; health; grants and grant making; higher and K-12 education; and profit and non-profit organizations.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Opening Statement at  Hearing on Medicare for All
Date: May 12, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Thursday delivered an opening statement at the committee’s hearing titled “Medicare for All: Protecting Health, Saving Lives, Saving Money.”The hearing is livestreamed on the Budget Committee’swebsiteand Sanders’ social mediapages.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:Let me thank the committee members and panelists and everyone else who is here for attending the very first U.S. Senate hearing on Medicare for All.Let me also thank the dozens of organizations throughout America who support Medicare for All and the tens of thousands of doctors, nurses and other health professionals who support this legislation.Let me thank the 15 Senate co-sponsors that we have on this legislation and the 122 Members of the House who support similar legislation.  And mostly, let me thank the American people who by the millions understand, as I do, that our current healthcare system is dysfunctional, extraordinarily wasteful and expensive, and cruel.The American people understand, as I do, that health care is a human right, not a privilege and that we must end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its citizens.It is not acceptable to me, nor to the American people, that over 70 million people today are either uninsured or underinsured.  As we speak, there are millions of people who would like to go to a doctor but cannot afford to do so.  This is an outrage.  This is un-American.  In the wealthiest country on earth, your health and your longevity should not be dependent on the amount of money that you have.Healthcare is a human right that all Americans, regardless of income, are entitled to and all Americans deserve the best healthcare that our country can provide.As Chairman of the Budget Committee, it is not acceptable to me that we end up spending over twice as much as virtually any other major country on health care, while our life expectancy and other healthcare outcomes lag behind most other countries.Unbelievably, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), we are now spending $12,530 per capita on healthcare.  This is an outrageous and unsustainable sum of money.In comparison, the United Kingdom spends just $5,268 per capita on healthcare while Canada spends $5,370, France spends $5,564 and Germany spends $6,731 while providing universal care to everyone.  The question that we should be asking is how does it happen that we spend so much money for healthcare, but get so little in return?Frankly, I am tired of talking to doctors who tell me about the patients who died because they were uninsured or underinsured, and walked into the doctor’s office when it was too late.  And we are talking about over 60,000 Americans who die every year because they are uninsured or under-insured. This is America.  This is truly beyond comprehension.I am tired of seeing working class families and small businesses pay far more for healthcare than they can afford which forces more than 500,000 Americans to declare bankruptcy each year because of medically related expenses.  Families should not be driven into financial ruin because someone became seriously ill.  How insane is that?I am tired of hearing from Americans who lost loved ones because they could not afford the unbelievably high cost of prescription drugs, or hearing from constituents who are forced to cut their pills in half due to the cost.  Today, almost 1 out of 4 patients cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.You want to hear about crazy?  Crazy is that people get sick.  They go to the doctor.  They get diagnosed and medicine is prescribed.  But they can’t afford to buy the medicine.  So they end up in an emergency room or a hospital at great expense to the system.  That is crazy.I am tired of talking with people who are struggling with mental illness but cannot afford the mental health counseling they desperately need.  Last year, a record-breaking 100,000 people died of drug overdoses and I will tell you that in my office and I suspect in all of your offices we get desperate calls from family members looking for affordable mental health counseling and, far too often, that help is not there.It’s not there because in this system, geared toward the profits of the insurance companies rather than  to the needs of the American people we don’t have enough psychologists and counselors.  We don’t have enough doctors.  We don’t have enough nurses.  We don’t have enough dentists. We don’t have enough medical providers in general.  We do have enough people to bill us.  We just don’t have enough people to provide healthcare to us.I am tired of talking to people who have teeth that are rotting in their mouths, but cannot afford the high cost of dental care.And on and on it goes.And let’s be clear about something.  The current debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with healthcare.  Frankly, it is hard to defend this dysfunctional system.This debate has everything to do with the unquenchable greed of the healthcare industry and their desire to maintain a system which fails the average American, but which makes the industry huge profits every single year.While ordinary Americans struggled to pay for healthcare during the pandemic, the six largest health insurance companies in America last year made over $60 billion in profits, led by the UnitedHealth Group, which made $24 billion in 2021.The CEOs of 178 major health care companies collectively made $3.2 billion in total compensation in 2020 – up 31% from 2019 – all in the midst of the pandemic.According to Axios, in 2020, the CEO of Cigna, David Cordani, took home $79 million; the CEO of Centene, Michael Neidorff, made $59 million; and the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, Dave Wichmann, received $42 million in total compensation.In terms of the pharmaceutical industry, last year Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie – three giant pharmaceutical companies – increased their profits by over 90 percent to $54 billion and the CEOs of just 8 prescription drug companies made $350 million in total compensation in 2020.Let us make no mistake about it.  The struggle that we are now undertaking, to guarantee health care to all Americans as a right and to substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs, is opposed by some of the most powerful forces in America – entities that have unlimited amounts of money.  We’re talking about the insurance companies, the drug companies, private hospitals, medical equipment suppliers, Wall Street and other powerful entities.In order to defeat the Medicare for All movement, these special interests have spent millions on 30 second television ads, full page magazine ads, and corporate-sponsored “studies” to frighten the American people about Medicare for All – which is exactly what happened before the passage of Medicare in the 1960s which was often attacked as moving our country towards “socialism.”  Meanwhile, today, Medicare is the most popular healthcare program in the country.Let me give you a few examples of the kind of money and power we are talking about.Since 1998, the private health care sector has spent more than $10.6 billion on lobbying and over the last 30 years it has spent more than $1.7 billion on campaign contributions to get Congress to do its bidding.The pharmaceutical industry alone has hired over 1,500 lobbyists – including the former leadership of both political parties to make sure we don’t lower the cost of prescription drugs.That’s how business is done in Washington.  Well, I have a radical idea.  Why don’t we pay attention to the needs of ordinary Americans rather than the big money interests who control the healthcare industry?Instead of a system that guarantees huge profits to the insurance  companies and the drug companies, why don’t we have a system which guarantees healthcare to every man, woman and child in America in a cost effective way?And that is exactly what Medicare for All does.This legislation would provide comprehensive health care coverage to all without out-of-pocket expenses and, unlike the current system, it would provide full freedom of choice regarding health care providers.No more insurance premiums, deductibles or co-payments.And comprehensive means the coverage of dental care, vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs and home and community based care.The transition to the Medicare for All program would take place over four years. In the first year, benefits to older people would be expanded to include dental care, vision coverage and hearing aids, and the eligibility age for Medicare would be lowered to 55. All children under the age of 18 would also be covered.In the second year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 45 and in the third year to 35.By the fourth year, every man, woman and child in the country would be covered by Medicare for All.Further, unlike the current dysfunctional system, Medicare for All allows people the freedom to choose any doctor, clinic, and hospital without worrying about whether their provider is in-network or not.  People will be able to make the health care choices that are best for themselves and their families without some insurance bureaucrat telling them which providers they can or cannot see.Would a Medicare-for-all health care system be expensive? Yes. But, while providing comprehensive health care for all, it would be significantly LESS expensive than our current dysfunctional system because it would eliminate an enormous amount of the bureaucracy, profiteering, administrative costs and misplaced priorities inherent in our current for-profit system.Under Medicare for All there would no longer be armies of people billing us, telling us what is covered and what is not covered and hounding us to pay our hospital bills.  This not only saves substantial sums of money but will make life a lot easier for the American people who would never again have to fight their way through the nightmare of insurance company bureaucracy.In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans $650 billion a year.Now, trust me.  I know the 30-second ads coming from the insurance and drug companies will tell you that if Medicare for All becomes law, your taxes will go up.  And they are correct.  But what they won’t tell you is that under Medicare for All, you will no longer be paying premiums, deductibles and co-payments to private health insurance companies.And what they certainly won’t tell you is that Medicare for All will save the average family thousands of dollars a year.  In fact, a study by RAND found that moving to a Medicare-for-all system would save a family with an income of less than $185,000 about $3,000 a year, on average.Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.  In 2020, 69 percent of the American people supported providing Medicare to every American.Now is the time for Congress to stand with the American people and take on the powerful special interests that dominate health care in the United States. Now is the time to improve and extend Medicare to everyone.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Calls for Ending the Filibuster to Protect the Right to Abortion
Date: May 10, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday called to end the filibuster to protect the constitutional right to have an abortion during remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:M. President: The recently leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization signals what many of us have feared would happen: At least 5 right-wing Supreme Court justices seem poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and abolish the constitutional right of women to have an abortion. In my view, the United States Senate cannot and it must not allow that to happen.We cannot go back to the days when women had to risk their lives to end an unwanted pregnancy. We cannot go back to the days of back alley abortions.We cannot go back to the days of forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy or go through a childbirth that could cause her illness, injury, or death.In America today, it is estimated that one out of every 4 women will choose to have an abortion by the time they turn 45. In 2019, over 625,000 women in America chose to have an abortion.While no one can say with any degree of certainty how many deaths there will be if abortion is made illegal and women are forced to carry unsafe pregnancies to term, there is no doubt that many thousands of them will die.I get very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from the extreme right wing who say: “get the government off our backs, we want small government.”Well, if you want to get the government off of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.During the COVID crisis, how many times have we heard the extreme right wing say: “The government must not force me to wear a mask. The government must not force me to get the vaccine. We need to eliminate all of those oppressive government mandates that are taking away my rights and freedom!”And yet these same right-wing politicians want the federal government, the state government and their own local government to mandate what women can and cannot do with their own bodies. What hypocrisy!The decision about an abortion must be a decision for the woman and her doctor to make, not the government.That is why I rise this evening in strong support of the Women’s Health Protection Act.This legislation would make Roe v. Wade the law of the land.This legislation would begin to put an end to the relentless assault on the reproductive rights of women that is taking place all over this country.But let me be as clear as I can be, M. President. It is not good enough to just talk about passing this bill.If there are not 60 votes in the Senate to pass this legislation, and there are not, we must end the filibuster and pass it with 50 votes.You know, I hear a lot of talk from my Democratic colleagues about the need for unity. Well, if there was ever a time for unity, now is that time.According to poll after poll, year after year, 60 percent of the American people believe that Roe v. Wade should be upheld. Moreover, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC poll, 75% of Americans say decisions on abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor, including 95% of Democrats, 81% of Independents, and 53% of Republicans.In other words, if the United States Senate was truly a representative body of the American people, which for a variety of reasons clearly it is not, we would easily have 60 votes to pass this bill and women would be protected.M. President: Let us not forget how we got to where we are today.Five years ago, Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees in order to do what they could not do legislatively: Make abortion illegal. They ended the filibuster.Candidate Donald Trump promised that he would only nominate Supreme Court justices who supported overturning Roe v. Wade. And, unfortunately, out of the many lies Trump made during his campaign and presidency, this seems to be the one promise he kept.Further, while it looks like, in this rare instance, Trump kept his promise, the Republican Supreme Court justices, during their Senate confirmation hearings, did not.In fact, Justice Alito and the three justices nominated by President Trump all called Roe v. Wade an “important precedent” during their confirmation hearings.Let me quote Justice Alito at his Senate confirmation on January 11, 2006: “Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long time. It is a precedent that has now been on the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has been reaffirmed.”In 2017, Justice Gorsuch said at his confirmation hearing: “Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed. A good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.”In 2018, Justice Kavanaugh said at his confirmation hearing: “I said that [Roe v. Wade] is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis. And one of the important things to keep in mind about Roe v. Wade is that it has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years, as you know, and most prominently, most importantly, reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992.”But today, it has become increasingly clear that despite these statements to the contrary, the three justices nominated by Trump were hired specifically to overturn Roe v. Wade. And, with Justice Alito at the helm, nominated by George W. Bush, that is precisely what it appears they are set out to do. Four justices – all appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. Is it any wonder why Americans all over the country are losing faith in their democracy?Well, you know what I believe, M. President: If Republicans can end the filibuster to install right wing judges nominated by presidents who lost the popular vote in order to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats can and must end the filibuster to make abortion legal and safe.Let’s be clear. If the Supreme Court strikes down Roe, abortion bans will immediately go into effect in 22 states in America with four others likely to follow suit. In ten of those states, it will be illegal to have an abortion even in cases of rape or incest.For example, in the state of Texas, if Roe v. Wade is struck down, it will be considered a felony for any Texas doctor to perform an abortion for a woman who was raped or impregnated by a family member. Further, that law would actually criminalize abortion – punishing both women and doctors, who could face years in prison if they are found guilty.Other states have passed similar types of legislation. Mississippi’s Governor has even refused to rule out the banning of contraception as a next step.But, M. President, let’s be clear. The Supreme Court will not be able to ban abortion.If you are wealthy and you have the means to get on an airplane or drive hundreds of miles – you will always have access to a safe abortion. But if you are poor or if you are in the working class you will not.The reality is that overturning Roe would be devastating for working class and low-income women who don’t have the means to travel long distances to a clinic.M. President: This issue is often framed as a “woman’s issue.” I disagree. This is a human rights issue and, if there’s ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women – this is that moment.M. President, I find it somewhat amusing that the loudest voices in the Republican Party demanding that women be forced to give birth against their will are exactly the same people who oppose virtually every piece of legislation designed to improve life for children and their mothers.They are opposed to paid family and medical leave in America.They are opposed to extending the $300 a month child tax credit that expired in December.They are opposed to universal childcare and pre-K.They literally believe that it is acceptable for an employer to force a mom to go back to her low-wage job a week after giving birth.M. President. Let me conclude by stating this. Women, throughout the history of this country, have had to fight valiantly for their basic human rights against all forms of patriarchy.Let us never forget that when our country was formed, women were not just second-class citizens. They were third- or fourth-class citizens.Women have been fighting for equal rights since the 1800s. They didn’t receive the right to vote until 1920. They needed a male co-signer on bank loans until 1974. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, women had to fight for entry into certain professions from which they were barred. The fight for equal pay continues to this day. We still haven’t fully passed the Equal Rights Amendment, despite 38 states ratifying it.Let’s be clear: When it comes to the rights of women, we cannot go backwards. We must move forward.We cannot go back to the days when women could not have full access to birth control.We cannot go back to the days of wide-scale domestic violence against women.The time has come for all of us to protect and expand women’s rights in America.I thank the President and I yield the floor.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Chairman Sanders to Hold Budget Committee Hearing on Medicare for All
Date: May 9, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, announced Monday that the committee will hold a hearing Thursday, May 12, at 11:00 a.m. titled “Medicare for All: Protecting Health, Saving Lives, Saving Money.”Today in the United States, some 112 million Americans, about 44 percent of the adult population, are struggling to pay for the medical care they need and over 70 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured because of high deductibles and premiums. Tens of thousands of Americans die each year because they can’t see a doctor in time and millions more suffer unnecessarily because of delayed treatment. In addition, life expectancy in the U.S. is much lower than most other industrialized countries and infant mortality rates are much higher. And yet, the U.S. spends twice as much per capita on health care as virtually any other major nation.In the midst of a pandemic that has so far claimed nearly one million American lives, the crisis that is the American health care system has only worsened. Roughly one in three Covid deaths in the U.S. are related to a gap in health coverage. Not only that, but the share of adults who do not seek treatment due to costs has tripled, nearly 27 million workers and their dependents lost their employer-sponsored coverage, and last year alone nearly one in four Americans could not afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors wrote.However, the gap in life expectancy between Americans and those in other countries starts to close at age 65 when seniors become eligible for Medicare. Additionally, estimates show that Medicare for All could save 68,000 lives per year, and numerous studies find that Medicare for All saves the American people and the U.S. health care system billions of dollars a year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Medicare for All would save $650 billion each year, improve the economy, and eliminate all out-of-pocket health care costs. Even a study done by the right-wing Mercatus Center estimated that Medicare for All would save more than $2 trillion over a decade.Testifying at the hearing will be Abdul El-Sayed, MD, DPhil, Adam Gaffney, MD, MPH, Bonnie Castillo, RN, the Honorable Charles Blahous, Ph.D., Grace-Marie Turner, and the Honorable Phillip Swagel, Ph.D.Hearing DetailsWhat:Hearing of the Committee on the Budget to consider “Medicare for All: Protecting Health, Saving Lives, Saving Money”When:11:00 a.m. ET, Thursday, May 12, 2022Where:Room SH-216.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Chairman Sanders Opening Statement at Hearing on Amazon and Ending Federal Contracts to Companies Engaged in Illegal Anti-Union Activities
Date: May 5, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, May 5 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Thursday delivered an opening statement at the committee’s hearing titled “Should Taxpayer Dollars Go to Companies that Violate Labor Laws?”The hearing is livestreamed on the Budget Committee’swebsiteand Sanders’ social mediapages.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.

Let me thank all of our witnesses for being with us this morning.

Let me thank Ranking Member Graham for his cooperation.

Today, we are going to discuss a very important issue that gets very little attention in the corporate media or in the halls of Congress.

And that is that at a time when the middle class continues to shrink, when half our people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider, there are millions of workers who are interested in joining unions so that they can negotiate for decent wages, benefits and good working conditions.

And yet, at exactly the time that this is happening, there are hundreds of corporations in America that receive federal contracts, huge subsidies, special tax breaks and all kinds of corporate welfare despite the fact that these same companies have engaged in widespread illegal behavior – including massive violations of labor laws.

And so the question that we are asking today is a very simple one: Should federal taxpayer dollars go to companies that violate labor laws and illegally prevent workers from exercise their constitutional right to form a union?

While corporations engaging in illegal activity against union organizing is widespread, this morning we are going to focus on one company, Amazon, who as we speak, is engaged in massive anti-union activity.

As we all know, last month, Amazon workers in Staten Island voted to form the first union at an Amazon warehouse in the United States.  This followed a union organizing attempt at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama – and I welcome some of those workers who are with us today.

From the very beginning of the union organizing efforts until today, Amazon has done everything possible, legal and illegal, to defeat the union.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that Amazon’s “flagrant disregard” of the law infringed on workers’ legal rights to a free and fair union election in Bessemer, Alabama ruling that Amazon’s behavior was “dangerous and improper.”

To date, there are currently 59 unfair labor cases against Amazon pending at the NLRB.

Amazon is currently being sued by the NLRB to reinstate a worker who was illegally fired for organizing a union.

Several current and former employees have alleged that Amazon has engaged in illegal harassment and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation.

And that’s not all. Amazon has already been penalized more than $75 million for breaking federal discrimination and labor laws.

Amazon misclassifies delivery drivers as independent contractors rather than employees to evade tax, wage, and benefit responsibilities.

Amazon’s inadequate workplace safety policies also pose grave risks to workers.  If you can believe it, according to a New York Times investigation, Amazon has a 150% percent turnover rate.  Workers come into the warehouses, they are worked as hard as humanly possible, and they leave. And a whole set of new workers come in to replace them.  Is this really a business model that should be rewarded

Further, in some locations, their workplace injury rates are more than 2.5 times the industry average.

Last December, six Amazon workers died after they were required to continue working during unsafe weather conditions in a warehouse that did not have appropriate safety facilities or policies.

It is abundantly clear that time and time again Amazon has engaged in illegal anti-union activity.

Further, Amazon cannot even come to grips with the reality that the workers in Staten Island won their union election fair and square.  In order to stall the process out, their lawyers have appealed that election result to the NLRB.  Their strategy is obviously to use their incredible wealth to stall, stall and stall.

In every way possible, they are refusing to negotiate a fair first contract with the Amazon Labor Union.

So, today, my question to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America, is simple: You are now worth $150 billion.  You became $45 billion richer during the pandemic.  You have enough money to buy a $500 million yacht, a $175 million estate in Beverly Hills, and a $23 million mansion right here in Washington, DC with 25 bathrooms.

Why are you doing everything in your power, including breaking the law, to deny Amazon workers the right to join a union so that they can negotiate for better wages, better benefits and better working conditions?

And the answer is not that complicated.  What Mr. Bezos understands is that union workers in America earn about 20% more, on average, than non-union workers.

Mr. Bezos understands that 79% of union workers have a defined benefit pension compared to just 17% of non-union workers.

Mr. Bezos understands that union workers are half as likely to be victims of health and safety violations compared to non-union workers.

And that is why Amazon has spent $4.3 million last year on union busting consultants and lawyers.

That is why Amazon is forcing workers to attend anti-union meetings.

And that is why Amazon has fired workers for “the crime” of being pro-union.

Well my message to Mr. Bezos is this: Enough with the intimidation. Enough with the harassment.  Enough with the coercion.  Enough with the illegal behavior.

Start treating your workers with the respect and the dignity that they deserve.  Give your workers a seat at the bargaining table.  Give all of your workers the freedom to join a union.

During the presidential campaign then-candidate Biden promised to “institute a multi-year federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions” and to “ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns.”

That campaign promise was exactly right.  Today, I am renewing my request to President Biden to fulfill that promise.

President Biden, more than any other president in modern American history, has talked over and over again about being pro-union – and I appreciate the President’s words and know him to be sincere on this issue.

In my view, however, the time for talk is over.  The time for action is now.

Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon who repeatedly break the law.

No government – not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government – should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Writes Letter Asking President Biden to Fulfill Campaign Promise and Cancel Amazon’s Federal Contracts
Date: April 26, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 26 – As Amazon refuses to recognize the historic vote to unionize a warehouse on Staten Island, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday sent aletterto President Joe Biden asking him to fulfill his campaign promise to stand with workers and strengthen the union organizing movement by preventing companies engaged in illegal anti-union activities from receiving federal contracts paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. In the letter, Sanders urged President Biden to sign an Executive Order to implement this plan.The federal government spends more than $600 billion each year on contracts to thousands of companies who employ more than four million contract workers. Since 2004, Amazon has received thousands of federal contracts worth billions of dollars.“Last September, I was delighted to hear you state that you ‘intend to be the most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history,’”wrote Sanders.“At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where too many workers are falling behind, your sentiment is exactly right…As you will recall, during the presidential campaign you promised to ‘institute a multi-year federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions’ and to ‘ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns.’ That campaign promise was exactly right. Today, I am asking you to fulfill that promise.”One of the largest and most profitable corporations in America, Amazon is the poster child as to why this anti-union busting Executive Order is needed now more than ever. Amazon spent over $4 million on consultants last year alone in an effort to prevent its warehouses from unionizing. Amazon has also been penalized more than $75 million for breaking federal discrimination and wage laws, is currently being sued by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for illegal anti-union retaliation, and has 59 Unfair Labor Practice cases currently open against them. Amazon’s inadequate workplace safety policies also pose grave risks to its workers – in some cases workplace injury rates rising to more than 2.5 times the industry average. Last December, six Amazon workers died after they were required to continue working during unsafe weather conditions in a warehouse that did not have appropriate safety facilities or policies.“Mr. President: It is abundantly clear that time and time again Amazon has engaged in illegal anti-union activity,”Sanderswrote.“Amazon may be a large and profitable corporation, it may be owned by one of the wealthiest people in America, but it cannot be allowed to continue to violate the law and the rights of its employees. The time has come to tell Amazon that if it wants another federal contract it must obey the law.”The recent votes to unionize at Amazon comes amidst awaveof worker protests, strikes, and unionizing efforts being seen across industries, generations, and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021. Sanders continues tostandwith workers across the country in their efforts to unionize, includingStarbucksworkers across the country,John Deereworkers in the Midwest,steelworkersin West Virginia,Krogerworkers in Colorado,Kelloggworkers across four states, Rich Productsbakeryworkers in California, WarriorMetminersin Alabama,Frito-Layworkers in Topeka,McDonald’sworkers, GSOC/UAWgraduateworkers at NYU, UVM Medical Centerresidents, more the30,000Kaiser Permanente health care workers across the country, and more.Read the full letter,here.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Asks President Biden to Fulfill Campaign Promise and Cancel Amazon’s Federal Contracts
Date: April 26, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 26 – Duringremarkson the floor of the U.S. Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday called for President Joe Biden to fulfill his campaign promise to prevent companies that are engaged in illegal anti-union activities, like Amazon, from receiving lucrative contracts from the federal government on the taxpayers dime. Sanders urged President Biden to sign an Executive Order to implement this plan.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.M. President, the American people are increasingly disgusted with the level of corporate greed that we are seeing in this country.As you know, while prices are rapidly increasing corporate profits are soaring – in the oil industry, in the food industry, in housing, and many other areas. Meanwhile, while the very rich get richer because of inflation many workers are seeing a decline in their real wages.During this pandemic, unbelievably, while workers struggle, the billionaire class has seen a $2 trillion increase in their wealth – and the level of income and wealth inequality today is the highest it’s been in over 100 years. Two people, Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos, now own more wealth than the bottom 42 percent – over 130 million Americans.In the midst of all of this, working people have declared loudly and clearly that enough is enough. We must end this corporate greed.Workers are now fighting back to improve their standard of living, to get the wages and benefits they need, and to get a seat at the negotiating table in a way that we have not seen in many years. They are organizing unions at a grassroots level and they are prepared to go out on strike when the greed of large corporations prevents them from receiving decent wages and decent benefits.During the last couple of years I have personally been involved in a number of union organizing campaigns and strikes throughout the country – from the John Deere, Nabisco and Kellogg’s strikes in the Midwest, to the Warrior Met strike in Alabama, to the Kroger’s grocery store strike in Colorado. I have been enormously impressed by the courage and tenacity of these workers who are demanding nothing less than economic justice.M. President, as you may know, an historic union victory was achieved nearly one month ago by Amazon workers in Staten Island.Amazon, as you know, is one of the most profitable and one of the most powerful corporations in America. It is also one of the largest employers in America with close to a million employees.We’re talking about a company that made a record-breaking $36 billion profit last year – a 453% increase from where it was before the pandemic. In other words, Amazon is doing better today than it has ever done.We’re talking about a company that is owned by Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America worth $170 billion.Interestingly, given our regressive and unfair tax system, we’re talking about a company that paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2017 and 2018 and paid a lower tax rate than a nurse or a firefighter last year after making billions in profits.We’re also talking about Mr. Bezos, who, in a given year, despite his extraordinary wealth, also pays nothing in federal income taxes. That’s what you can do when you make campaign contributions and have an army of accountants and lawyers working for you.M. President, during the pandemic, Mr. Bezos, like other billionaires, became much richer. In fact, since March of 2020 Mr. Bezos became $65 billion richer. M. President, do you know why people in this country are angry? During the pandemic, tens of thousands of essential workers had no choice but to go to work. And they died. That’s what happens when you live paycheck to paycheck. And during that same period, Mr. Bezos became $65 billion richer.Mr. Bezos has enough money to own a $500 million, 417-foot mega-yacht.He has enough money to afford a $175 million estate in Beverly Hills that includes a 13,600 square-foot mansion.He has enough money to afford a $78 million, 14-acre estate in Maui.He has enough money to own a $23 million mansion in Washington, DC with 25 bathrooms.He has enough money to buy a rocket ship to blast William Shatner to the edge of outer space.And yet, even though Mr. Bezos can afford all of those mansions and all of those yachts and all of those rocket ships, Mr. Bezos refuses to pay his workers decent wages, decent benefits or provide decent working conditions. This is what excessive greed is all about. And the American people want action.From the very beginning of the union organizing effort until today, Mr. Bezos and Amazon have done everything possible, legal and illegal, to defeat the union.In fact, Amazon cannot even come to grips with the reality that the workers in Staten Island won their union election fair and square. In order to stall the process out, their lawyers have appealed that election result to the NLRB. Their strategy is obviously to use their incredible wealth to stall, stall and stall.In every way possible, they are refusing to negotiate a fair first contract with the Amazon Labor Union.In fact, Amazon has been engaged in a massive attempt to undermine the union organizing drive – in direct violation of labor laws and regulations.Let’s be clear: Amazon has already been penalized more than $75 million for breaking federal discrimination and labor laws.Amazon is currently being sued by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to reinstate a worker who was illegally fired for organizing a union.To date, there are currently 59 unfair labor cases against Amazon pending at the NLRB.Several current and former employees have alleged that Amazon has engaged in illegal harassment and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation.Amazon misclassifies delivery drivers as independent contractors rather than employees to evade tax, wage, and benefit responsibilities.Amazon’s inadequate workplace safety policies also pose grave risks to workers. If you can believe it, according to a New York Times investigation, Amazon has a 150% percent turnover rate. Workers come into the warehouses, they are worked as hard as humanly possible, and they leave. And a whole set of new workers come in to replace them.Further, in some locations, their workplace injury rates are more than 2.5 times the industry average.Last December, six Amazon workers died after they were required to continue working during unsafe weather conditions in a warehouse that did not have appropriate safety facilities or policies.It is abundantly clear that time and time again Amazon has engaged in illegal anti-union activity.Amazon may be a large and profitable corporation, it may be owned by one of the wealthiest people in America, but it cannot be allowed to continue to violate the law and the rights of its employees. If working people are asked to obey the law they do it or they are punished by the law. That same principle must be upheld for a large and powerful corporation like Amazon.And that is why, this morning, I sent a letter to President Biden urging him to sign an executive order to prohibit companies like Amazon that have violated labor laws from receiving federal contracts paid for by the taxpayers of America.Let me quote from this letter:“Dear President Biden:Last September, I was delighted to hear you state that you ‘intend to be the most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history.’At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where too many workers are falling behind, your sentiment is exactly right. We need to build the trade union movement in America and allow more workers to engage in collective bargaining.One of the most effective ways for you [President Biden] to begin accomplishing this important goal would be to ensure that no corporation that is engaged in illegal anti-union activities receives a contract paid for by the taxpayers of the United States.As you will recall, during the presidential campaign you [President Biden] promised to ‘institute a multi-year federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions’ and to ‘ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns.’That campaign promise was exactly right. Today, I am asking you [President Biden] to fulfill that promise … As you may know, Amazon, one of the largest and most profitable corporations in America, is the poster child as to why this anti-union busting Executive Order is needed now more than ever.”M. President: I ask unanimous consent to include the full text of my letter into the record.President Biden, more than any other president in modern American history, has talked over and over again about being pro-union – and I appreciate the President’s rhetoric and know him to be sincere on this issue.Just this afternoon, in an article in Politico, in response to my letter, “A White House official said that the president ‘has stated consistently and firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to bargain collectively with their employer.’ The official, who declined to be named, added that Biden believes ‘there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, and no anti-union propaganda from employers while workers are making that vitally important choice about a union.’”But that is exactly what is happening at Amazon. There is intimidation. There is coercion. There are threats and anti-union propaganda. In fact, all of that is precisely what Amazon is doing.In my view, the time for talk is over. The time for action is now.Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon and multi-billionaires like Jeff Bezos who repeatedly break the law.No government – not the federal government, not the state government and not the city government – should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators.So today I say to President Biden: You promised to prevent union busters like Amazon from receiving lucrative contracts from the federal government. Please keep that promise.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and VA Secretary Hear Directly from Vermont Veterans During Two-Day Visit to See Health Care System Firsthand
Date: April 19, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., April 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former chair and current member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, last week hosted Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cabinet Secretary Denis McDonough on a two-day visit to see firsthand Vermont’s health care system for veterans and hear directly from the veterans it serves.Throughout the trip, Sanders andMcDonoughmet with Vermont VA leadership, veterans, clinical and non-clinical staff, union representatives, and medical students, including six veterans and military students. On Wednesday, April 13, Sanders and McDonough visited the White River Junction VA Medical Center and regional benefits office. On Thursday, April 14, Sanders and McDonough met with staff of the Burlington Community Based Outpatient Clinic and toured the facility to better understand the current space and opportunities for expansion. Sanders hosted a roundtable of Vermont veterans to hear directly from them about their experience with the VA. Sanders and McDonough also met with students at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine to discuss health care for veterans and medical careers within the VA health care system. Sanders and McDonough were available to media on both days following the visits to the VA Medical Center and Community Based Outpatient Clinic.On Thursday at the end of the visit, in the rain under a tent outside the Burlington Outpatient Lakeside Clinic,Sanders said:“I want to thank Secretary McDonough for spending not just one day here in Vermont, but two days. During this visit, he and I spoke with dozens and dozens of Vermont veterans. Secretary McDonough was able to hear directly from VA practitioners and administrators, medical students, and Vermont veterans themselves. And I think he’s learned a lot about the strengths of Vermont’s VA system and some of the problems that we have yet to overcome. In a very divided Washington D.C., it is my hope and belief that every member of the United States Congress understand that we cannot turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend this country. And that, for all veterans, good quality health care is a right that they have earned and that we have got to deliver.”Discussions throughout the trip ranged across issues faced by veterans in Vermont and around the country, from expanding eligibility to allow more veterans to enroll in the VA health care system, to addressing the housing crisis hitting Vermont communities and VA staff as well. As many veterans indicated throughout the visit, VA health care is excellent, but figuring out how to enroll can be complex and convoluted, making it so some veterans give up before they have a chance to experience the great health care provided by the VA. Another major point that came up throughout the trip from Vermont veterans and other participants, was the urgent need for the VA to include dental care coverage in its health care offerings.At the end of the visit,McDonough said: “It was a privilege traveling with Senator Sanders and speaking with Veterans of the great state of Vermont. While VA has done some great work on their behalf, it’s clear we still have work to do. Our passionate and dedicated VA workforce in Vermont has been remarkable – especially under the crucible of the pandemic these past two years. This is indicative of the commitment VA has in working with Senators Sanders and Leahy, and Representative Welch to help deliver the absolute-best care and services to Veterans.”Sanders also stated on Thursday:“Right now there are some immediate issues that my office is working on, which we’ve been talking to the Secretary about and we hope to implement them in the months and years to come. One is this: It is my belief, and we have legislation to this effect, that dental care is health care, and the VA should incorporate dental care as part of VA health care. Number two, and in a more parochial sense, we have a wonderful community-based outpatient clinic right here. It needs to expand because it is outgrowing its ability to serve veterans. A third point that I want to make is, I hope every veteran in Vermont understands that the quality of VA health care is high quality care. That if you’re eligible for VA health care, you’re entitled to excellent quality hearing aids at very small cost and the lowest cost prescription drugs available in America. So, I look forward to working with the Secretary to do everything that we can to enroll every eligible Vermont veteran into VA health care.”Recently in the Senate, Sanders held a bipartisan roundtable discussion on strengthening VA dental care with the current chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Jon Tester (D-Mont.), committee ranking member Jerry Moran (R-Kans.), stakeholders, and VA officials. In 2021, Sanders introducedtwo pieces of legislation– the Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act and the Veterans State Eligibility Standardization Act – that would ensure universal dental care coverage for all veterans through the VA and eliminate long-standing barriers to health care for veterans across the country. This legislative push would also help address the shortage of dentists in the U.S. by ensuring the VA maintains dental clinics in all states and incentivizing dental school enrollment and service to the nation’s veterans.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Stands in Solidarity with UVM Medical Center Workers Fighting to Unionize
Date: April 9, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this week sent aletterto interns, residents and fellows of the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) in support of their efforts to form a union. Sanders recently met with UVMMC residents who shared with him how organizing a union would lead not only to decent wages and better working conditions, but also to improved care for their patients.“Many Vermonters understand, as patients, that our health care system is broken in many ways.”wrote Sanders in the letter of support.“But what they might not see is that the system is broken for residents as well…Patients want and deserve physicians who treat them to be rested, not unduly stressed and adequately compensated for their difficult and vitally important work. That really is not too much to ask.”Sanders continued,“Interns, residents and fellows should not have to work 80 hours a week because the old system of medicine allowed for it. They should not have to give up everything in their lives, take no days off, hold off on having children, and take on debilitating debt – all to be good doctors. They should not be forced to live on salaries that are so low that many of them struggle to pay for basic needs like housing and child care. We can do better than that and your advocacy and your persistence is what will inevitably change our system.”With the third year of the coronavirus pandemic and the specter of a new sub-variant, health care workers continue to risk their lives to keep communities healthy and safe. Today, more than 330 residents work at UVMMC, making up the majority of the physician workforce caring for patients at the facility. Together with their nurse colleagues, who first formed a union in 2002, these organized health care providers will be better positioned to negotiate for policies that prioritize patient care over executives’ salaries.“There is no one that I would trust more to advocate for our health care system in Vermont than the frontline health care workers who risked their lives to care for us during the COVID-19 pandemic,”Sanders wrote.“Your efforts to unionize will only ensure we are better prepared for the next years of recovery and for the quality health care that all Vermonters deserve.”Read the full letterhere.

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Calls for “Strategic Pause” on Corporate Welfare to Profitable Companies
Date: April 6, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 6 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday called for a “strategic pause” on corporate welfare to profitable companies during remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate.Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.

M. President: I look forward to offering two roll call votes on Motions to Instruct Conferees to the so-called “competitiveness” bill based on the assurances given to me by the Majority Leader.The first motion would instruct the conference committee not to provide $53 billion to the highly profitable micro-chip industry without protections for the American taxpayer.The second motion would instruct conferees not to provide a $10 billion bailout to Blue Origin – a space company owned by Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America, who is also the owner of Amazon. Amazon is a company which, in a given year, pays nothing in federal income taxes after making billions in profits. And, by the way, in a given year, Mr. Bezos himself has paid nothing in federal income taxes despite being worth nearly $200 billion.Let’s be clear. Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a $500 million yacht – and here it is.Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms in Washington, DC – and here it is.No. I do not think that tax the taxpayers of this country need to be providing him a $10 billion bailout to Mr. Bezos to fuel his space hobby.When all is said and done both of these motions touch on an extremely important issue that is rarely discussed in the corporate media or on the floor of the Senate.And that is how we proceed with industrial policy in this country. Now, let me be clear. I believe in industrial policy. I believe that it makes sense, in certain occasions, for the government and the private sector to work together to address a pressing need in America. Industrial policy to me means cooperation between the government and the private sector. Cooperation. It does not mean the government providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to profitable corporations without getting anything in return.In other words, will the United States government develop an industrial policy that benefits all of our society, or will we continue to have an industrial policy that benefits the wealthy and the powerful?In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: “The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.”I am afraid what Dr. King said 54 years ago was accurate back then and it is even more accurate today.We hear a lot of talk around here about the need to create public-private partnerships – and that all sounds very good. But when the government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all of the risk and privatizes all of the profits – whether it’s handing the micro-chip industry a $53 billion blank check or giving Jeff Bezos a $10 billion bailout to fly to the moon – that’s not a partnership. That is the exact opposite of a partnership. That is corporate welfare. That is crony capitalism.M. President: Each and every day, I have heard my Republican colleagues and some corporate Democrats blame inflation on runaway government spending.One of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus has even suggested that we need to take a “strategic pause” when it comes to making urgent federal investments in childcare, healthcare, education, affordable housing, paid family and medical leave and home healthcare – policies that would substantially improve the lives of the American people.Well, you know what I believe, M. President? I believe that, maybe, just maybe, the time has come to take a strategic pause when it comes to providing tens of billions in corporate welfare to some of the most profitable corporations and wealthiest people on the planet.And M. President, the American people are increasingly sick and tired of corporations making record-breaking profits, while they struggle to pay outrageously higher prices for gas, rent and food.They are sick and tired of the high cost of prescription drugs, child care, housing and groceries.They are sick and tired of CEOs making 350 times more than the average worker, while over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck.They are sick and tired of the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations not paying their fair share of taxes.And what does this so-called “competitiveness” bill do?Instead of addressing any of these issues this bill provides $53 billion in corporate welfare to the micro-chip industry with no protections for the American people and a $10 billion bailout to Mr. Bezos to fly to the moon.Maybe that makes sense to Mr. Bezos and the CEO of Intel, but it makes zero sense to me.M. President, in terms of the micro-chip industry, the American people should know the truth.We are talking about an industry that has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs over the last 20 years while moving most of its production overseas.In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies shut down plants in America and hired cheap labor abroad. And now, believe it or not, these very same companies are in line to receive $53 billion in corporate welfare to undo the damage that they did.Some of my colleagues make the point that the microchip industry is enormously important for our economy and that we must become less dependent on foreign nations for micro-chips. I agree. There is no argument about that. But we can and must accomplish that goal without simply throwing money at these companies while the taxpayer gets nothing in return.M. President, I suspect 5 major semi-conductor companies will likely receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Global Foundries, and Samsung.These 5 companies made over $75 billion in profits last year.The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer assistance is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I wish them well. But, let’s be clear. Intel is not a poor company. It is not going broke.In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits.We’re talking about a company that had enough money to spend $14.2 billion during the pandemic, not on research and development, but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy shareholders.We’re talking about a company that could afford to give its CEO, Pat Gelsinger, a $116 million compensation package last year.We’re talking about a company that could afford to spend over $100 million on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past 20 years.Does it sound like this company, and the others, really need corporate welfare?Another company that will receive taxpayer assistance under this legislation is Texas Instruments.Last year, Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good-paying American jobs to low-wage countries and spent more than $40 million on lobbying over the past 20 years.And on and on it goes.The first amendment that I would like a vote on would instruct the conference committee to prevent microchip companies from receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue warrants or equity stakes to the Federal Government.If private companies are going to benefit from over $53 billion in taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders. In other words, all this amendment says is that if these investments turn out to be profitable as a direct result of these federal grants, the taxpayers of this country have a right to get a return on that investment.M. President. This is not a radical idea. These exact conditions were imposed on corporations that received taxpayer assistance in the bipartisan CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96 to 0.In other words, every Member of the U.S. Senate has already voted for the conditions that are in this amendment.In addition, this amendment would also instruct the conference committee to require these highly profitable companies not to buy back their own stock, not to outsource American jobs, not to repeal existing collective bargaining agreements and to remain neutral in any union organizing effort.Again this is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were imposed on companies that received funding from the CARES Act and passed the Senate by a vote of 96-0.The second motion that I have introduced touches on an issue that we have rarely discussed on the floor of the Senate.Unbelievably, the so-called “competition bill” would provide some $10 billion in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America, for his space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in America. This is beyond laughable.You know, when we were younger and Neil Armstrong made it to the moon, there was incredible joy and pride in this country that the United States of America did something that people forever had thought was impossible.We sent a man to the moon, an extraordinary accomplishment. And the entire world watched that event with bated breath. It was just an extraordinary accomplishment for all of humanity, not just the United States, but we, of course, took special pride because that was an American project.M. President, I worry very much that what we are seeing now is not a space race between the United States and other countries as to which nation will return to the moon and perhaps get to Mars, but a space race between Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos, the two wealthiest people in America, as to who will gain control over NASA and future space explorations. In other words, if we are able to accomplish the extraordinary goal of sending a person to Mars I want the flag that will be flying on that planet to be the flag of the United States, not the flag of Space X or Blue Origin.And, M. President, let’s be clear. The $10 billion in this bill for Jeff Bezos and his space company Blue Origin is just the tip of the iceberg.The reality is that the space economy – which today mostly consists of private companies using NASA facilities free of charge to launch satellites into orbit – is already very profitable and could become even more so in the future.Bank of America predicts that by 2030 the space economy will triple in size to $1.4 trillion – that’s trillion with a “t.”According to the most recent data, private corporations make over $94 billion in profits a year from goods or services that are used in space – profits that could not have been achieved without the assistance of NASA – a government agency funded by the taxpayers of America.And while today we are talking about the profitability of satellites, sometime in the future – certainly not tomorrow or next month or next year but perhaps in our lifetime – the real money may come to those who figure out how to mine lucrative minerals on asteroids.In 2015, the famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson predicted that, and I quote, “The first trillionaire there will ever be is the person who exploits the natural resources on asteroids … There’s this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless resources. I look at wars fought over access to resources. That could be a thing of the past, once space becomes our backyard.”M. President, who gets to own the resources discovered by private corporations in space? Well, as a result of the 2015 Space Act that passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent with virtually no floor debate, private corporations are able to own all of these resources. In other words, the taxpayers of this country will get a zero percent return on the investment they made in these private enterprises.M. President: Is that what we want space exploration to become? Do we really think that it is acceptable for NASA to hand out billions of dollars to some of the wealthiest billionaires in America today to make them even richer?Or do we want to use space exploration to benefit ordinary Americans and improve lives here on planet earth?It’s time that we had a serious debate on the future of NASA instead of just handing out $10 billion to Jeff Bezos.You know, M. President, a few days ago, Amazon workers in Staten Island voted to form the first union in Amazon’s history. Instead of providing Jeff Bezos billions of dollars in taxpayer assistance to fuel his space hobby, maybe, just maybe the Senate should be congratulating the workers at Amazon and pass legislation to make it easier, not harder, for workers to form unions.Let me be very clear. I believe that space exploration is very exciting. It has the potential to substantially benefit all of humanity. But, if we continue down the path of privatizing space exploration, it also has the potential to make the obscenely rich even richer and more powerful than anyone can possibly imagine today. In my view, we cannot allow that to happen.I yield the floor.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Bush, Crow Introduce Energy Security and Independence Act of 2022
Date: April 6, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 6 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) today introduced the Energy Security and Independence Act, a historic effort to lower utility bills, strengthen America’s renewable energy supply chain, and put the country on the path to energy independence through the Defense Production Act. This legislation would invest $150 billion in onshore renewable energy manufacturing and create thousands of good-paying, union jobs.

“When it comes to the existential threat of climate change, we are in the midst of a global struggle with nothing less than the future of the planet at stake,”said Sen. Sanders.“Today, with rising prices on essential items and Russia’s horrific war in Ukraine, it is clear now more than ever: Addressing climate change and energy dependence is not just an environmental issue, it is a matter of national security. That’s why I’m proud to join with Representatives Bush and Crow to introduce the Energy Security and Independence Act, which would put us on the path to transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Not only would this legislation help us combat climate change and strengthen energy security and independence in the U.S., but it will help working families save money on their utility bills, create good, union jobs, and take on the greed of oligarchs both here and abroad. Now is the time to think and act boldly in order to leave a more peaceful and habitable world for our children and grandchildren.”

Nearly 80 percent of energy consumption and 60 percent of electricity generation in the U.S. comes from fossil fuels.Sixty percentof Vermont households use fossil fuels for heating. In Vermont in the past year, the price of a gallon of heating oil has increased by 82 percent ($2.28) and the price of a gallon of gas has increased by 49 percent ($1.37).

“The days of energy security being synonymous with a reliance on human rights violators like Russia and Saudi Arabia, or a propagation of corporate profits for Exxon, Chevron, and BP, are over,”said Rep. Bush.“When we talk about energy security, it’s time we include the safety of Black and brown lives in that definition. Energy security means making energy affordable for every household. Energy security means investing in energy efficiency so people can breathe clean air and keep the heat or air conditioning on. Energy security means alleviating the climate crisis by reducing our emissions and transitioning to renewable energy. I’m proud to work together with my colleagues Senator Sanders and Congressman Crow to make our vision of energy security a reality in this country.”

“As the climate crisis worsens and oil prices skyrocket from Putin’s war, we must accelerate our transition to clean energy,”said Rep. Crow.“I’m proud to join with Rep. Bush and Senator Sanders in introducing the Energy Security and Independence Act – commonsense legislation that will help meet the moment on our climate goals and bolster our national security.”

The Energy Security and Independence Act will strengthen and onshore zero-emission energy production, invest in high-quality, good-paying union jobs, and reduce legacy pollution levels across the country that have disproportionately affected generations of Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities. Natural gas has exposed 1 million Black Americans to cancer-causing chemicals and caused too many Black children to miss thousands of days of school. Climate change’s worst impacts, including flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat, are also more likely to affect frontline low-income communities left with nowhere else to live.

Specifically, the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2022 will:

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Floor Speech on Growing Union Movement
Date: April 4, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 4 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday gaveremarkson the floor of the U.S. Senate on the growing labor movement in the United States following two major victories at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island and a Starbucks roastery in New York City.

Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.

M. President, let me begin by congratulating the workers at Amazon in Staten Island who, for the first time, were able to win a union organizing campaign against that giant corporation which is owned by Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America.

Amazon spent over $4 million in trying to defeat the union drive. The independent union, the Amazon Labor Union, had almost no money at all for their grassroots campaign but ended up with 55% of the vote. Congratulations Amazon Labor Union.

I also want to congratulate the workers at Starbucks for their incredible union organizing efforts. Starbucks has coffee shops in some 15,000 locations all across the country and, until a few months ago, none of them were organized. Then, in December, workers in 2 shops in Buffalo, New York voted to join a union and that union organizing effort is now spreading like wildfire all across the nation. In fact, last Friday workers in New York City successfully voted to form the first Starbucks union roastery and tenth union Starbucks coffee shop in America. And, in the coming weeks and months, Starbucks workers in some 170 other coffee shops in 27 states will be holding union elections.

What makes these union victories so impressive is that from start to finish they were accomplished by a grassroots movement with very little financial resources.

Why is it important that we support these union organizing efforts? We live in a time of massive income and wealth inequality where CEOs make 350 times more than the average worker, where 2 people own more wealth than the bottom 42 percent.

While the billionaire class is becoming much, much richer, real weekly wages for American workers are $40 lower today than they were 49 years ago. In fact, during that period there has been a massive, massive transfer of wealth from the working class and middle class of our country to the top one percent.

According to the RAND Institute, since 1975, $50 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90% to the top 1% – primarily because corporate profits and CEO compensation has grown much faster than the wages of average workers.

And listen to this, which really says it all. During this terrible pandemic, when thousands of essential workers died, gave up their lives, doing their jobs, some 700 billionaires in America became nearly $2 trillion richer.

Today, multi-billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are off taking joy rides on rocket ships to outer space, buying $500 million super-yachts and living in mansions with 25 bathrooms.

And let’s be clear. It’s not just income and wealth inequality. It is economic and political power. In America today, just 3 Wall Street firms (Black Rock, State Street and Vanguard) control assets of over $21 trillion which is essentially the GDP of the United States, the largest economy on Earth. 3 Wall Street firms.

Why do we want to grow the union movement? Because unions provide better wages, benefits and working conditions for their members. In fact, union workers make, on average, wages that are about 20 percent higher than their non-union counterparts. They also have much better healthcare and far better pension plans than non-union employees. And, by the way, when unions win decent contracts for their employees they drive up wages for all workers in the country.

Further, unions give workers some degree of control over their work lives and make them more than just cogs in a machine. They end the ability of companies being able to arbitrarily fire workers for any reason and to impose any schedule that they want on their employees. In other words, at a time when we are seeing more and more concentration of ownership in this country and increased corporate power, unions give workers the ability to fight back and have some control over their lives.

Similarly, when large corporations have enormous political power through the billions they spend on lobbying, campaign contributions and advertising, unions have the capability to fight back and create a legislative agenda that works for all Americans and not just the few.

What these union victories tell me is that working people all over this country are sick and tired of being exploited by corporations making record-breaking profits.

They are sick and tired of billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, becoming obscenely rich during the pandemic, while they put their lives on the line working for inadequate wages, inadequate benefits, inadequate working conditions and inadequate schedules.

And let’s be clear. If you think that the union victories at Amazon and Starbucks are an aberration, you would be sorely mistaken.

During the last year, I have been proud to stand in solidarity with courageous workers around the country who have been on strike or who are engaged in union organizing efforts.

I’m talking about the United Auto Workers who went on strike at John Deere in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas to protest against massive cutbacks to retirement benefits and totally inadequate pay raises.

I’m talking about the United Steel Workers who went on strike at Special Metals in West Virginia – a company owned by Warren Buffett worth $127 billion – to fight for good wages and good benefits.

I’m talking about Bakery Workers who went on strike at Kellogg’s, Nabisco and the Jon Donaire ice cream cake factory in California fighting for justice, dignity and respect.

I’m talking about the United Mine Workers who are still on strike at Warrior Met in Alabama – a company owned by BlackRock – the largest Wall Street investment firm in the country managing $10 trillion in assets.

I’m talking about the United Food and Commercial Workers who went on strike at the King Soopers grocery store chain owned by Kroger in Colorado.

And I’m talking about graduate students and Adjunct Professors at MIT who are waging a strong union organizing effort on that campus.

Today, I want to continue to express my support for these workers who are not only organizing for themselves and for their coworkers, but for all of us – and, in fact, for the future of the entire country.

M. President, while we may not hear much talk about the struggles of the working class in communities across the country, let’s be clear.

The union struggles that have been taking place against corporate greed ultimately determine the quality of wages, benefits, and working conditions that all American workers enjoy.

In other words, when unionized workers do well in raising the bar for economic and social justice, we all do well. Their success is our shared success. Make no mistake about it, we cannot have a strong middle class in this country without a strong labor movement.

Here is the bottom line. In the year 2022, the United States and the rest of the world face two very different political paths. On one hand, there is a growing movement towards oligarchy in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country.

On the other hand, in opposition to oligarchy and corporate greed, there is a movement of working people and young people who, in ever increasing numbers, are fighting for justice in a way that we have not seen in years.

And it is that growing trade union movement that makes me so very hopeful for the future of this country – and it is a movement that I will do all that I can to support.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Nearly 100 Other Lawmakers Urge Biden Administration to Extend the Payment Pause and Cancel Student Debt
Date: April 4, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 4 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) last Thursday joined Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) in sending a letter to President Biden urging the administration to act now to extend the pause on federally-held student loan payments until at least the end of the year and to cancel student debt. If the pause on student loan payments is not extended, borrowers will have to begin repaying their student loans on May 1.

“Given the fast-approaching deadline for borrowers to resume payments, your administration must act as quickly as possible to extend the pause and make clear to the American public your intention to cancel a meaningful amount of student debt,”wrote the lawmakers.“We look forward to supporting your administration in getting it done.”

The payment pause has provided essential relief to millions of families during the economic and public health crisis brought on by the pandemic, including saving borrowers an average of $393 per month, and allowing them to pay down other debt, relieve financial pressures from lost jobs or decreased earnings, and support their families’ needs. Restarting repayment will financially destabilize many borrowers, and will cause hardship for many who cannot afford repayment. Most borrowers are not financially prepared to shoulder another bill as they face skyrocketing costs for necessities like food and gas.

“Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues.”wrote the lawmakers.“Student debt cancellation must be one of the key actions in your comprehensive approach to advance equity as our nation works to rebuild a stronger and more equitable economy.”

Sanders has long fought for the cancellation of all student debt and to make higher education an option for everyone, regardless of economic background. In 2019, Sanders introduced theCollege for All Act.If passed, the legislation would guarantee tuition-free community college for all students, and allow students from families earning under $125,000 a year to attend public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free. It would also guarantee students from families earning under $125,000 a year can attend tuition-free and debt-free public and private, non-profit Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions, and other Minority-Serving Institutions.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Urges VA Secretary to Cut Bureaucratic Red Tape and Expand Health Care for All Veterans
Date: April 1, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 1 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, on Tuesday urged Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Dennis McDonough to simplify and strengthen the VA’s ability to deliver quality and comprehensive health care to all veterans, including those suffering from exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. Sanders argued that the VAs budget should go to, “health care, not towards a huge bureaucracy to determine whether or not you were exposed.”

Sanders’ remarks came during a hearing for the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs titledHonoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2021.

“Health care happens to be a human right, for all Americans in my view, and especially those people who have put their lives on the line, such as our veterans,”said Sanders.“So, I think, instead of spending a huge amount of money in the federal bureaucracy to figure out whether or not somebody was exposed to toxins from a burn pit, [or] exposed to Agent Orange, maybe we just say that if you were a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country, you are going to get all of the health care you need.”

At the hearing, Sanders emphasized the urgent need to simplify eligibility requirements and more efficiently allocate taxpayer dollars to ensure all veterans are able to receive quality health care from the VA.

In 2021, Sanders introduced theVeterans State Eligibility Standardization Actand theVeterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Actto ensure universal dental care coverage for all veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and eliminate long-standing barriers to health care for veterans across the country.

Title: MEDIA ADVISORY: Chairman Sanders to Hold Budget Committee Hearing on Corporate Greed
Date: April 1, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, April 1 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, announced Friday that the committee will hold a hearing Tuesday, April 5, at 11 a.m. titled “Corporate Profits are Soaring as Prices Rise: Are Corporate Greed and Profiteering Fueling Inflation?”

Tuesday’s hearing comes as working families across the country are increasingly bearing the brunt of growing economic pain and inequality. Across every major industry, prices continue to rise – this includes a 38 percent increase in the price of gasoline, a 44 percent increase in the price of heating oil, a 41 percent increase in the price of a used car, a 24 percent in the price of rental cars, and a 17 percent increase in the price of furniture. Further, Tyson Foods recently increased beef prices by 32 percent, the price of chicken by 20 percent and the price of pork by 13 percent. As prices increase, corporate profits hit a record high of nearly $3 trillion in 2021, up 25 percent in a single year.

This level of corporate greed has only widened the gap between the top one percent and the working class. In 2020, CEOs of the top firms in the U.S., on average, made nearly 350 times more than the median worker. As corporations increase costs for working families, many are rewarding their shareholders with stock buybacks and their CEOs with massive compensation packages. In 2021, S&P 500 firms spent nearly $900 billion on stock buybacks. Corporate executives have bragged to shareholders about increasing prices to make themselves obscenely richer.

“Let me be clear,” said Sanders. “The American people are sick and tired of corporate greed. They are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record-breaking profits. They are sick and tired of being forced to pay outrageously high prices for gas, rent and food while large corporations make out like bandits. We cannot continue to allow large, profitable corporations to use the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the specter of inflation to make outrageous profits by price gouging Americans in every sector of our economy. It’s time we discuss how corporate greed and profiteering are fueling inflation.”

Testifying at the hearing will be Robert Reich, Lindsay Owens, and Michael Faulkender.

WASHINGTON, March 28 – Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Monday issued the following statement after President Joe Biden released his fiscal year 2023 federal budget proposal:I thank the President for submitting his budget proposal to Congress and I look forward to reviewing it closely. At a time when corporations are making obscene profits by charging outrageously high prices for gas, food and rent, we need a budget that takes on the unprecedented corporate greed that is taking place in America today by enacting a windfall profits tax and preventing corporations from ripping off working families.At a time when over 700 billionaires in America became nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic while tens of millions continue to struggle, we need a budget that demands that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes and substantially improves the lives of working families with children, the elderly, the sick and the poor.At a time when we are dealing with a climate emergency, we need a budget that creates millions of good-paying jobs transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and towards energy efficiency and renewable energy.At a time when we are already spending more on the military than the next 11 countries combined, no we do not need a massive increase in the defense budget.Now that the President has done his job, it is up to Congress to review it, pass the proposals that make sense and improve upon it. As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I will be doing everything I can to pass a strong and robust budget reconciliation bill that works for working families, not the top 1 percent. To begin that process, the Senate Budget Committee will be holding a hearing on the President’s budget at 11 a.m. this Wednesday.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Reinstate the WWII Windfall Profit Tax to Combat Rising Inequality, Inflation, and Corporate Profiteering
Date: March 25, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 25 – With working families across the country increasingly bearing the brunt of growing economic pain and inequality – amidst the conflict in Ukraine, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and spiking prices of critical necessities – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday introduced legislation in the Senate that would impose a 95 percent windfall tax on the excess profits of major companies. A temporary emergency measure, Sanders’ Ending Corporate Greed Act could raise an estimated $400 billion in one year from 30 of the largest corporations alone and would apply only in 2022, 2023, and 2024.Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) is cosponsoring the legislation in the Senate, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives.This would not be the first time the United States implemented a windfall profits tax. Sanders’ legislation is modelled after the broad-based windfall profits taximplementedby the U.S. during the first and second World Wars and the Korean War. During World War II, the tax rate reached as high as 95 percent, which ensured that companies could not profiteer off the war. The U.S. alsoenacteda windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies as recently as the mid-1980s.“The American people are sick and tired of the unprecedented corporate greed that exists all over this country. They are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record-breaking profits while working families are forced to pay outrageously high prices for gas, rent, food, and prescription drugs,”said Sen. Sanders.“We cannot allow big oil companies and other large, profitable corporations to continue to use the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the specter of inflation to make obscene profits by price gouging Americans at the gas pump, the grocery store, or any other sector of our economy. During these troubling times, the working class cannot bear the brunt of this economic crisis, while corporate CEOs, wealthy shareholders, and the billionaire class make out like bandits. The time has come for Congress to work for working families and demand that large, profitable corporations make a little bit less money and pay their fair share of taxes.”“My constituents are hurting, and they are rightly asking what Congress can do about surging prices for food, energy, and other necessities,”said Rep. Bowman.“What we cannot do is ask working Americans to shoulder any more of this burden. Corporate price-gouging is playing a big role in the inflation we are experiencing right now, putting families in a financial squeeze in the middle of an ongoing pandemic. These are the same corporations that are eroding our democracy, eviscerating workers’ rights, and fueling the climate crisis — and it is time to make them pay. The Ending Corporate Greed Act will take away any incentive for large companies to exploit our current crisis for profit, and it will protect workers, families, and small businesses in New York and across the country. Our country has successfully used windfall profits taxes in the past, and I look forward to working with Senator Sanders to pass this bill as soon as possible.”“Oil companies are raking in record profits, while Americans are facing price hikes at the pump,”said Sen. Markey.“Something is fundamentally broken when the biggest corporations in the country are leveraging a pandemic and a war to pad their profit margins as average Americans suffer. That is why I am co-sponsoring Senator Sanders’ Ending Corporate Greed Act to protect consumers from profiteering and stand against economic inequality.”If signed into law, Sanders’ Ending Corporate Greed Act would:

Under this legislation, even with the 95 percent windfall profits tax, companies would still be able to make a reasonable profit compared to previous years. Additionally, as the tax is on profit, not revenue, companies that raise prices for legitimate reasons related to rising expenses would not be penalized. However, companies that have chosen to raise prices in the pursuit of obscene profiteering, to further enrich their CEOs and wealthy shareholders, would pay a tax of up to 95 percent on their windfall profits. For example:

This legislation has been endorsed by: the Economic Policy Institute, American Economic Liberties Project, Groundwork Action, Sunrise Movement, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch, and Center for Biological Diversity. Numerous scholars and policy experts have also voiced support for the windfall profits tax as a strong measure to fight inflation and limit corporate profiteering, includingtax scholarReuven Avi-Yonah,economistsEmmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, and Economic Policy InstituteeconomistJosh Bivens.Read the summary,here.Read the fact sheet and statements of support,here.Read the bill text,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Tells Starbucks’ Returning CEO Howard Schultz to “End the Union Busting and Obey the Law”
Date: March 22, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday sent a letter to incoming Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz ahead of his announced return to the company, highlighting some of the egregious anti-union efforts the company has undertaken to fight employees who are building a movement to unionize Starbucks locations around the country.“If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends and provide a $20 million compensation package to its CEO, it can afford a unionized workforce that can collectively bargain for better wages, better benefits, safer working conditions and reliable schedules,” Sanders wrote. “Mr. Schultz: This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks. As you return to the company, it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law.”Since the first Starbucks cafe unionized in Buffalo, N.Y. in December of 2021, workers at more than 140 locations across 27 states have filed for union elections, winning 6 of the 7 elections held so far. However, Starbucks’ corporate leadership has fought their own employees every step of the way, subjecting them to an intense anti-union campaign that has included surveillance, hiring workers to vote against unionization, store reassignments, and even illegal tactics such as firing workers who were leading organizing efforts. After investigating and finding merit that Starbucks retaliated against employees seeking to unionize, the National Labor Relations Board last week issued a formalcomplaintagainst the company.Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Leahy, Welch Call on Sciolex CEO to Engage Fairly with Workers at Vermont Service Center for Citizenship and Immigration
Date: March 21, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 21 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), on Monday wrote to Kevin Miller, CEO of the Sciolex Corporation, to express concern over the treatment of Sciolex workers at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Vermont Service Center (VSC). Formerly based in St. Albans, the VSC, now located in Essex Junction, is one of five USCIS service centers in the country that collectively handle between eight and ten million immigration cases per year – performing the essential work of preparing and processing immigration benefits applications and petitions.

In the letter, the Vermont Congressional delegation called on Sciolex to engage fairly with the workers and their union, the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (UE) Local 208.

Sanders, Leahy, and Welch wrote, “After speaking with your workers, we have heard troubling reports that you have implemented unilateral changes to benefits and COVID policies and refused to bargain in good faith with the union. Further, it has been reported to us that you have threatened, punished, and intimidated workers in retaliation for their participation in the union and protected concerted activity.”

In the letter, the Vermont lawmakers described worker reports that Sciolex violated the “No Strike No Lockout” provision of their collective bargaining agreement and fired UE Local 208 of the St. Albans, Vermont chapter, President Christine Brown, for her participation in a rally that took place on March 2, 2022, on her own time. President Brown had worked at the VSC since 1995.

“Mr. Miller, our message to you is simple: treat your workers with dignity and engage in good faith with them and their union,” wrote the delegation. “These jobs are not only important to Vermont, but to individuals, families, and communities across the country. Workers at the VSC deserve safe working conditions, fair benefits, and respect for their legal right to organize and be represented by a union.”

WASHINGTON, March 15 – An amendment – introduced today by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to provide over $177 million in mandatory funding for the Nurse Corps program for Fiscal Year 2023, which would double the amount of funding it is receiving from this year – was successfully added to the bipartisan pandemic legislation. The full bill passed the committee and now awaits consideration on the Senate floor.Sanders’ amendment passed 12-10.“Nurses are the backbone of our health care system in Vermont and across the country,” said Sanders. “Simply stated, we will not have the quality health care we need unless we have an adequate number of nurses who are well trained and well compensated. Make no mistake about it: Unless we address this crisis now, it will only get worse in the future. More patients will suffer. More patients will be unable to get the care they need. The amendment I offered today will make this bill just a little bit better by beginning to address the severe nursing shortage in America that has only gotten worse during the pandemic.”The Bureau of Labor Statistics recentlyestimatedthat the U.S. could be facing a shortage of over 1 million nurses this year alone. The crisis is felt even more acutely in rural areas, with 99 percent of rural hospitals facing a staffing shortage and 96 percent saying that they’re having difficulty finding nurses, according to a recent survey from theChartis Center for Rural Health. Almost half of the rural hospitals in this survey reported that staffing problems prevented them from accepting new patients, while one out of four rural hospitals reported that a lack of nurses had forced them to suspend services like delivering babies, chemotherapy and colonoscopies.The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which runs the Nurse Corps program, predicted several years ago that the U.S. will need an additional200,000 nurseseach and every year through 2030 to replace retiring nurses and meet growing demand. The past two years have only increased that demand.This amendment is supported by the American Federation of Teachers, the Association of Clinicians for the Underserved, and National Nurses United.See the full amendment text,here.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Colleagues Call on VA to Protect Veterans’ Care
Date: March 15, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 15 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday, along with Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), sent aletterurging the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to forgo any actions that would limit veterans’ ability to get their VA care at VA facilities in New Hampshire or Vermont. The letter follows the VAreleasing its recommendationsfor the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission.

“We write to express concerns regarding the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission,” the Senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge the VA – and the nascent Commission – to forgo any actions that would limit veterans’ ability to get their VA care at VA facilities in New Hampshire or Vermont.”

The Senators continued, “While we are relieved that the recommendations recognize the value of the White River Junction and Manchester VA Medical Centers, we believe that VA services in our states should be bolstered, not reduced. The current recommendations risk moving towards privatization and decreased access to VA care for veterans. We strongly urge the VA and the Commission to prioritize New Hampshire and Vermont veterans’ access to VA care and services. As a country, we must honor the service of our veterans by keeping their physical and mental wellbeing at the forefront of our decisions. We will continue Congressional oversight of this process and look forward to engaging with the VA and the Commission as we ensure that our veterans receive the care they deserve.”

Sanders, a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, has long fought to protect and expand veterans’ care. Last year, Sanders introduced two bills to expand and improve comprehensive health care for veterans: TheVeterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Actand theVeterans State Eligibility Standardization Act.These bills would ensure universal dental care coverage for all veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and eliminate long-standing barriers to health care for veterans across the country.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on End of MLB Lockout
Date: March 10, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 10 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday issued the following statement after the Major League Baseball lockout ended:

“I’m delighted to see an agreement reached so that the Major League Baseball season can start. But the recent and unacceptable behavior of MLB’s owners has taught us some very important lessons that cannot be ignored. We are dealing with an organization controlled by a number of billionaires who collectively are worth over $100 billion. It should be clear to all that these baseball oligarchs have shown that they are far more concerned about increasing their wealth and profits than in strengthening our national pastime.

“These are baseball oligarchs who negotiated in bad faith for more than 100 days in a blatant attempt to break the players’ union. These are baseball oligarchs who, over the last year, eliminated their affiliation with over 40 minor league teams, not only causing needless economic pain and suffering, but also breaking the hearts of fans in small and mid-sized towns all over America. These are baseball oligarchs who continue to pay minor league players totally inadequate wages and want to eliminate the jobs of another 900 minor league players. These are baseball oligarchs who receive billions of dollars in corporate welfare from taxpayers to build expensive stadiums. These are baseball oligarchs who, in many cases, charge outrageously high prices for tickets that many working class families cannot afford.

“It would be wrong for Congress to simply celebrate today’s agreement and move on. We must prevent the greed of baseball’s oligarchs from destroying the game. The best way to do that is to end Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption and I will be introducing legislation to do just that.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces More Than $38 Million in Funding for Vermont Communities
Date: March 9, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 9 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday announced that more than $38 million he requested on behalf of Vermont initiatives were included in the major government funding bill expected to pass Congress this week. Sanders’ initiatives will strengthen Vermont communities and meet Vermonters’ needs across a wide range of issues, from child care and sustainable energy, to health care, dental care, wastewater infrastructure, housing, education, and services for veterans’ and military personnel.

“Over the years, I have spoken with thousands of Vermonters, and heard their excellent ideas about how to best use federal funds to help our state,” Sanders said. “Through this congressional appropriations process, I had the privilege of working closely with Vermonters to secure funding that will help strengthen our communities. In these difficult times, this an important step in the right direction. These projects, in my view, will ensure the federal government is working for our people and our communities.”

Some of Sanders’ project requests include: a new child care center in Alburgh; increasing access to quality, affordable dental care across Vermont’s federally qualified health centers; expanding the Vermont Employee Ownership Center to enable more Vermont small businesses to transition to employee ownership; sustainable energy projects for Vermont schools and public buildings; and expanding Vermont’s highly-successful Support and Services at Home model to low-income families and individuals living in affordable housing.

Funding secured by Sanders will also establish the first-of-its-kind Vermont Center for Correctional Post-Secondary Education to provide a tuition-free community college education and career training at all six of Vermont’s correctional facilities for both incarcerated individuals and correctional officers. Sanders, along with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), also secured funding for the Vermont National Guard to build a new, state-of-the-art facility to serve Guard members and their families. This initiative builds upon funding originally secured by Sanders to establish the Vermont Veterans Outreach Program, which has become a model for assisting National Guard members and their families before, during, and following deployments and will allow these programs to operate in a safe, welcoming, family-friendly environment.

The government funding deal, made public today, awaits passage by the House and the Senate, and will then be sent to President Biden to be signed into law.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Passage of Major Postal Reform Bill
Date: March 8, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, March 8 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted to pass the Postal Service Reform Act, legislation that Sanders cosponsored:

“The people of Vermont and all over this country are increasingly concerned about the long delays they are experiencing in getting the mail they need. Senior citizens and veterans are not getting the prescription drugs they need on time. Working families have been forced to pay late fees because it is taking much longer than normal for the Postal Service to mail their bills. That is unacceptable.“For a number of years I have fought to strengthen and expand the United States Postal Service, and I am very pleased that, today, the Senate was able to pass the Postal Service Reform Act. This bill ends the disastrous prefunding mandate which costs the Postal Service billions every year, protects six-day delivery, and gives the Postal Service the ability to offer new consumer products and services. Is this all that is needed to fix the problems at the Postal Service? No, it is not. But it is an important step forward for one of our nation’s most popular and important government agencies, for its workers, and for the communities it serves.“Now we must work to ensure that Vermonters and people across the country receive their mail on-time and that postal workers are provided good pay, benefits and dignity on the job.”Sanders voted against the 2006 law signed by President George W. Bush that required the Postal Service to pre-fund 75-years of future retiree health benefits for employees who haven’t even been born. Sanders has fought to repeal this absurd prefunding requirement ever since it passed, and successfully led the fight to beat back efforts to privatize the USPS and close rural post offices and mail processing facilities in Vermont and across the country.

BURLINGTON, Vt., Feb. 25 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement after President Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate D.C. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court:

“Let me congratulate President Biden for nominating Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court. In my view, we need a new member of the Supreme Court who has a strong track record standing up for justice – economic justice, racial justice, social justice, political justice and environmental justice. There is no doubt that Judge Jackson is that person.

“With nearly a decade of experience on the federal bench, Judge Jackson has proven that she is not only immensely qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, but that she is committed to fairness and equal justice under the law.

“Judge Jackson has already been confirmed by the Senate three times on a bi-partisan basis – twice by unanimous consent. There is no reason for her not to receive a fair and expeditious hearing in the Judiciary Committee and to be confirmed by the Senate as quickly as possible. I strongly support her nomination.”

“The United States and our allies must impose severe sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his fellow oligarchs. At a time when thousands may die as a result of his war, Putin, one of the richest people in the world, should not be allowed to enjoy the billions he stole from the Russian people. The United States must also work closely with international partners to provide humanitarian relief for the Ukrainian people.”

“Vladimir Putin’s latest invasion of Ukraine is an indefensible violation of international law, regardless of whatever false pretext he offers. There has always been a diplomatic solution to this situation. Tragically, Putin appears intent on rejecting it. The United States must now work with our allies and the international community to impose serious sanctions on Putin and his oligarchs, including denying them access to the billions of dollars that they have stashed in European and American banks. The U.S. and our partners must also prepare for a worse scenario by helping Ukraine’s neighbors care for refugees fleeing this conflict. Finally, in the longer term, we must invest in a global green energy transition away from fossil fuels, not only to combat climate change, but to deny authoritarian petrostates the revenues they require to survive.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Hears Directly from Vermont Students at Virtual Town Meeting
Date: February 17, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 – As the world faces the third year of the coronavirus pandemic and a growing crisis in schools around the country, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday evening held a virtual student town meeting to hear directly from young people about the challenges they are experiencing today and how the federal government can begin to address their needs.Watch the full town meetinghere.“The bottom line is the pandemic has had a huge impact on every person in Vermont and I think every person in America,”said Sandersin his opening remarks. “Many working people have lost their jobs. Many college students have seen their education disrupted. Many elderly people, who are most vulnerable I think to the virus, have been isolated, unable to interact with their grandkids, their kids, their friends, and their family…But sometimes when we talk about the impact of the pandemic we are not focusing enough on young people, who perhaps have been hardest hit by what is going on today. And tonight, basically what we’re going to do is have young people from throughout the state of Vermont…just talk about what their experience has been…during the pandemic, and what they think federal, state, and local governments can do to improve the situation.”Joining the town meeting as panelists were middle and high school students from towns across Vermont, including Brownington, Duxbury, Proctor, Burlington, Newport, Bennington, Fairfax, Winooski, Bellows Falls, Morrisville, Twinfield, Rutland, and Barton. A number of adults with experience on issues from health care and mentorship to education, jobs, and after school programming, also joined the event to help provide resources and support for students.Jayda Perry, a 7th grader at Proctor Jr./Sr. High School, said, “It’s so hard personally because with the beginning of 2020 we had so much time taken away from us. I personally had a giant drain in my mental health, as well as my peers, with not getting that social interaction. I don’t think many people realize how much of an impact that has two years later. It just took so much that we can’t get back.”“I became a freshman at the beginning of Covid. This was a struggle because I have not had one full year of normal high school at all,”said Joey Jacques, a junior at Bellows Falls Union High School.The student panelists spoke about a broad range of issues, including how the pandemic has affected social life, learning opportunities such as studying abroad, and remote versus in-person learning, as well as mental health challenges and services. The discussion ranged from inadequate curriculums and plans for college, to increased stress, anxiety, isolation, and depression, as well as affordable housing, civil rights, standardized testing, climate change, and power and money in politics.After each panel, the discussion opened up to questions from online and phone participants, that focused on how the federal government can address the needs of young people.One participant asked how ordinary Vermonters can make their voices heard to ensure the U.S. does not create a climate disaster for future generations. Other attendees asked questions about how to get more involved in government, how to access mental health services, the status of mask mandates, as well as raised concerns about not having enough teachers and guidance counselors and wanting more summer and after school opportunities.Sam Blackman, a senior at Mount Anthony Union High School, asked Sanders: “As a generation we’re being thrown into the teeth of multiple different crises…We got covid, we got economic turmoil. Our government system seems like it’s becoming more unstable by the minute. There is just a lot of instability that this generation is coming of age in right now. My question is, what do you think that we can do ourselves, and what do you think that people in government can do to try to set us up the best to be able to deal with the coming crises – because this isn’t going to stop. We’ve got all sorts of stuff that we’re going to have to deal with. It’s just a lot that comes down on our generation right now.”“You’re absolutely right. I wish I could tell you something else,”saidSandersin response. “A lot, a lot is coming down on your shoulders…What I would say is, as hard as all of this stuff is, and it is. It’s one crisis after another…We got to understand the reality and then we have to be as strong and as tough as we can be. But one of the things we don’t do is start blaming everybody else…That’s what we don’t do. This is hard. We’ve given your generation just an enormous number of crises to deal with. And we’re going to have to figure out our way through them. All I can say is that here in the Congress, some of us, have worked very, very hard trying to figure out how do we make it easier for you to go to college and not leave school deeply in debt? How do we make sure that your family has good quality health care and can afford the prescription drugs they need? How do we make sure moms who give birth have access to good quality child care for their kids? How do we make sure that the planet we’re leaving you is a habitable and healthy planet? We’re working on those issues and we need you to be involved, your generation to be involved, in helping us to address it, to understand why things are the way they are, and how we can improve it.”Additional Vermont student panelists included Lee Blanco, an 8th grader at Brownington Central School, and Grady Hagenbuch, an 8th grader at Crossett Brook Middle School, who both spoke on the Middle School Panel. Additional high school panelists included, Ella Ambroggio of Burlington High School, Callie Beloin of North Country Union High School, Hunter Cargill of Bellows Free Academy-Fairfax, Khellmar Daring of Winooski High School, Max King of Peoples Academy, Ana Lindert-Boyes of Twinfield Union School, Gabriella Olsen of Rutland High School, and Grace Wilson of Lake Region High School.To learn more about future events, interested Vermonters can sign up for Senator Sanders’ official newsletter – the Bernie Buzz – atwww.sanders.senate.gov/newsletter-signup.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Padilla Lead Letter with Colleagues to Billionaire Bob Rich in Support of Striking Bakery Workers in California

Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) Tuesday, along with their colleagues Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), sent a letter to Bob Rich Jr., Chairman and majority owner of the Rich Products Corporation, to express support for the 100 or so bakery workers on strike against the appropriately named Rich Products Corporation at the Jon Donaire Desserts production plant in Santa Fe Springs, California. On strike for better wages and working conditions since November 3, 2021, about 75% of the employees are Latina women who are often forced into mandatory overtime with little to no notice and sometimes work up to 16 hours a day.The senators urged Chairman Rich to bargain in good faith with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) union and agree to a fair contract for the striking workers as soon as possible.“Rich Products is not a poor company. It is not going broke,” the senators wrote to Rich. “Last year, your company made over $4 billion in revenue. During the pandemic, you became over $2 billion richer and now have an estimated net worth of more than $7.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. We do not believe that it is too much to ask that you treat your workers with the respect and dignity they have earned and deserve.”The striking workers make cakes for Baskin Robbins, Safeway and Cold Stone Creamery, helping to bring in the $4 billion the company made in revenue last year. During the pandemic, Bob Rich, the majority owner of Rich Products, increased his wealth by more than $2 billion. While the workers he employs barely make more than California’s minimum wage, Rich currently has a net worth of more than $7.5 billion. Yet, despite his billions in wealth, the “best and final offer” Rich has put on the table for his workers is a substantial increase in health care premiums and an insulting $1-an-hour wage increase that would not keep pace with inflation.“Mr. Rich: Your employees have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, keeping production lines moving at breakneck speeds and fueling company profits,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to bargain in good faith with the union and agree to a fair contract as soon as possible.”The bakery strike comes amidst awaveof worker protests across industries and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021. Sanders recently rallied in support of striking Kellogg’s workers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee; led letters of support for strikingsteelworkersin West Virginia,Kellogg’s workersand more than30,000 Kaiser health care workers; and stood insolidaritywithworkersatJohn Deere,Starbucks,McDonald’s,Frito-Lay,TeamstersHunts Point Market workers,GSOCUAWgraduate workers at NYU,Churchill Downs, and more.Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Medicare Limiting Coverage for Alzheimer’s Drug
Date: January 11, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday issued the following statement after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule that would cover Aduhelm, the outrageously expensive Alzheimer’s treatment, and similar drugs in development only for people enrolled in qualifying clinical trials:

“Biogen’s outrageous original price for Aduhelm, $56,000 per year, is the poster child for how dysfunctional our drug pricing system has become and it is the perfect example of why Medicare should be negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. If the administration takes no action, Medicare recipients will continue to see their biggest premium increase in history, all because of Biogen’s greed. That cannot be allowed to happen.

“Beyond the incredibly high price, Aduhelm has not been proven to be effective by the scientific community. It was rejected for coverage by the Veterans Health Administration and at least a half a dozen private health insurance companies in the United States, while 10 out of the 11 experts on the Food and Drug Administration’s advisory council voted against approval of the treatment.

“Today’s action by CMS is an important step forward, especially following Secretary Becerra’s move yesterday to direct Medicare to reconsider a premium rate hike caused in part by the outrageous price of Aduhelm. I urge the administration to immediately lower Medicare premiums by at least $11.50 a month and to provide a refund to 57 million senior citizens for the premium increases that have already gone into effect this month. I would also urge the President to reinstate and expand the reasonable pricing clause that requires drug makers who have benefitted from taxpayer funded research to charge reasonable prices for drugs and treatments. Americans should not have to pay an outrageous price for a drug that their tax dollars helped develop.”

In early December of 2021, Sen. Sanders sent aletterto President Biden urging his administration to delay an increase in Medicare premiums coming in 2022 following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of Aduhelm. Sanders first spoke out about Biogen’s outrageous greed when the original $56,000 price tag for the treatment was released in July of last year.

Title: NEWS: Sanders, Colleagues Urge Biden Administration to Protect Consumers Against High Heating and Energy Prices This Winter
Date: January 7, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with colleagues in both the Senate and House of Representatives, Wednesday sent a a bicameralletterto Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick urging the agency to use its authority to protect consumers from unfairly high energy costs.

“We write to express our concern in regard to the effect that anticipated increases in heating and energy costs will have on our constituents this winter,” wrote the lawmakers. “As the entity tasked with the regulatory mission of ensuring consumers can access reliable energy at a reasonable cost, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a significant role to play in promoting energy justice and protecting United States residents from unfairly high energy costs. Under its statutory authority, FERC has the power to influence retail rates for natural gas and electricity, including by preventing market manipulation in wholesale natural gas and electricity markets and enforcing gas spot market transparency. We urge the Commission to use its existing regulatory authority to ensure that households’ energy bills are not driven up by manipulation, obfuscation, or other malfeasance from regulated entities, and to work collaboratively with other agencies to address energy debt.”

“For too long, the federal government has allowed too many utility companies to put profit above the public,” continued the lawmakers. “We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to safe living conditions, and we cannot let corporate greed or a quest for profit get in the way of fundamental human rights. With high winter energy costs, the ongoing threat of the pandemic, and racial and economic justice issues surrounding energy debt, we urge FERC to use its existing statutory authority to better protect consumers from energy market manipulation.”

Members of Congress who joined the letter include Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Representatives Alma Adams (NC-12), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), David N.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Colleagues Push to Solve the Nursing Crisis in Vermont
Date: January 3, 2022
Subtitle: 

Content:
Burlington, Vt., Jan. 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Governor Phil Scott, and Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint – on behalf of both herself and House Speaker Jill Krowinski – came together Monday to discuss Vermont’s nursing workforce crisis.

Estimates suggest that Vermont needs to add approximately 9,000 nurses to the state’s workforce in the next seven years. However, Vermont’s nursing schools are currently only able to graduate between 500 and 600 nurses each year – less than half of the number needed to keep up with retirements and those leaving the workforce.

“Nurses are the backbone of our health care system in Vermont and across the country,”said Sen. Sanders.“Simply stated, we will not have the quality healthcare we need unless we have an adequate number of nurses who are well trained and well compensated. I have absolute confidence that this is a problem that can be solved. I look forward to working with the governor, the legislature and the congressional delegation to make certain that we do that.”

“I want to thank Senator Sanders and his staff for all their work with my team over the last several months, focusing on this important issue. Growing our workforce, particularly in the health care sector, must be a top priority for all elected officials in Vermont,”said Governor Scott.“The Budget Adjustment I’ve proposed includes nearly $18 million for training, recruitment and retention for Home and Community Based Service human service providers. And, for the broader health care community, this week, I’ll also propose an additional investment of $15 million for retention bonuses, grants to support employers in training and retaining new nurse graduates, and funding to assist with recruiting and relocation international nurses. I look forward to working with Senator Sanders and  state legislative leaders in the coming months to make needed progress.”

“We need to do this for all Vermonters in all communities because when we need medical care we want there to be a nurse to help us.  We know that many nurses across Vermont are already feeling overwhelmed. They’re working long hours to cover holes in schedules caused by staffing shortages. This isn’t fair and it’s not sustainable. The legislature will continue to work together with the administration and our federal delegation to meet this critical need.”said Senate President Pro Tempore Balint and House Speaker Krowinski.

Last month, Sandersannouncedrecord funding to bolster health care workforces in rural and underserved communities in Vermont through loan repayments and scholarship programs. In September of last year, Sandersannouncedthat Vermont’s 11 federally qualified health centers received over $6.9 million in funding to support major health care construction and renovation projects, including COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination infrastructure projects. More information on these programs – including how to apply – can be foundhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Asks President Biden to Demand the Immediate Resignation of Trump’s Handpicked Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy
Date: December 23, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday issued the following statement asking President Biden to demand the immediate resignation of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service:“Given the serious crisis and total failure of leadership at the United States Postal Service, I am urging President Biden to demand the immediate resignation of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General.“By any objective measure, Louis DeJoy, a top campaign contributor of Donald Trump, has been, by far and away, the worst Postmaster General in the modern history of America.“Since Mr. DeJoy was handpicked by President Trump to serve as Postmaster General in May of 2020, the quality of the Postal Service has been severely undermined. Tragically, the situation has only gotten worse since Mr. DeJoy began implementing his disastrous 10-year plan to substantially slow down mail delivery, cut back on post office hours, shut down mail processing plants, and dismantle mail sorting machines.“During the busy holiday season, this could not come at a worse time. Not only are millions of people in Vermont and throughout the country not getting their Christmas presents delivered on time, senior citizens have experienced massive delays in receiving the lifesaving prescription drugs they desperately need and working families have been forced to pay late fees because it is taking much longer than normal for the Postal Service to mail their bills.“The President made the correct decision to begin mailing 500 million at-home COVID tests for any American who requests one. But, given the deterioration of the postal service under Mr. DeJoy, how can anyone have confidence that these life-saving tests will be delivered to the American people in a timely and efficient manner? I think the obvious answer to that question is they cannot.“Further, it has been well documented that Mr. DeJoy has over a dozen major conflicts of interest due to his financial interests in several companies that have ties to the Postal Service. This includes a $120 million contract that the Postal Service awarded to XPO Logistics in April to operate two sorting and distribution facilities in Atlanta and Washington, DC. Mr. DeJoy was the CEO of XPO’s supply chain business and still holds an investment of at least $30 million in this company.“The United States Postal Service is a vital part of our economy and our way of life. We need a Postmaster General who will strengthen and expand the Postal Service, not someone who continues to undermine and sabotage it.“It is long past time for Mr. DeJoy to go.”

BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 19 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sunday issued the following statement after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) announced he would not support the Build Back Better Act:

“If Sen. Joe Manchin wants to vote against the Build Back Better Act, he should have the opportunity to do so with a floor vote as soon as the Senate returns. He should have to explain to West Virginians and the American people why he doesn’t have the courage to stand up to powerful special interests and lower prescription drug costs; expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and eyeglasses; continue the $300 per child direct monthly payment which has cut childhood poverty by over 40%; and address the devastating impacts of climate change. He should also have to explain why he is not prepared to demand that millionaires and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.

“I also find it amusing that Sen. Manchin indicates his worry about the deficit after voting just this week for a military budget of $778 billion, four times greater than Build Back Better over ten years and $25 billion more than the president requested.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Opposes Califf for FDA Commissioner
Date: December 14, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday issued the following statement announcing his opposition to Dr. Robert Califf’s nomination to run the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):

“At a time when the American people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and as drug companies continue to be the most powerful special interest in Washington, we need leadership at the FDA that is finally willing to stand up to the greed and power of the pharmaceutical industry. Not only have the drug companies spent over $4.5 billion on lobbying and hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions over the past 20 years, they also have created a revolving door between the FDA and the industry. Shockingly, nine out of the last ten FDA Commissioners went on to work for the pharmaceutical industry or to serve on a prescription drug company’s board of directors.

“Unfortunately, Dr. Califf is not the exception to that rule. After leaving the FDA in 2017, he received consulting fees from Merck, Biogen and Eli Lilly. According to his financial disclosure form, he owns up to $8 million in the stocks of major drug companies. That is exactly the close relationship Big Pharma has exploited to regulate the FDA, instead of the FDA regulating them.

“The Covid-19 pandemic has made clearer than ever the choice between pharmaceutical profits and the health of our people. In this critical moment, Dr. Califf is not the leader Americans need at the FDA and I will oppose his nomination.”

Title: NEWS: Sanders Announces Record Funding for Health Care Workers and Students in Vermont
Date: December 3, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Friday announced the largest ever investment of federal funds, both in Vermont and across the country, to bolster health care workforces in rural and underserved communities through loan repayments and scholarship programs. The historic $1.5 billion – made possible largely by the $1 billion in supplemental funding authorized through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), which was passed by the Senate and signed into law earlier this year – more than doubles the number of health care professionals around the country who will benefit from the programs.

Today, more than 22,000 participants in these programs – including nurses, doctors, and dentists – are providing health care to over 23 million people across the country who might otherwise go without the care they need. In the new year, the Biden Administration plans to make additional awards made possible by the ARP.

“We are facing an extreme shortage of doctors and nurses in this country, a crisis that is endangering the lives of our fellow Vermonters,” said Sen. Sanders. “As a result, patients suffer – and sometimes die – unable to get the care they need. We must address this crisis now before it gets any worse. In the richest country in the history of the world, no one should go without access to doctors, nurses, dentists, and other medical professionals. I am proud to say that this funding will not only benefit patients, but will make it easier for young people to choose to go into primary care – no longer being forced into medical specialties just so they can pay their student loans. If we are successful in helping Vermonters apply for this funding, I have no doubt that we will see more young people choose rewarding careers in physical, oral, and mental health care – making these desperately needed services more available throughout our state.”

Within this new investment, Sanders helped secure $800 million for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), nearly triple its original funding. More than half of NHSC members serve in community health centers, a longtime priority for Sen. Sanders. There are currently eleven community health centers across Vermont providing primary, mental, and dental care, as well as substance use disorder treatment and affordable prescription drugs to nearly one-in-three Vermonters each year – regardless of their ability to pay.

Sanders also helped to secure $200 million for the Nurse Corps, more than double its regular funding, and is fighting to secure further funding for these programs in the Build Back Better Act.

By increasing scholarship and loan repayment awards by 27 percent, this new investment – made through NHSC, the Nurse Corps, and the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment (STAR) Program – will strengthen and expand the number of health care workers in key professions including primary care, dental care, behavioral health, psychiatry, and substance use disorder treatment.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) oversees the administration of funding for these critical programs.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Tuesday issued the following statement amid developing reports of the new Omicron coronavirus variant and the recent move by the World Trade Organization topostponea major Ministerial Conference in Geneva:“Nearly a year since vaccinations began to roll out here in the U.S. and while too many of our neighbors around the world still are blocked from accessing life-saving vaccines, the time for debate by the members of the World Trade Organization is over. As we face the potential threat of a new coronavirus variant, we must move even more urgently to dismantle the vaccine inequality that undermines our ability to confront this crisis. We cannot postpone or delay. It’s time for the WTO and our world leaders to step up, to finally put people over profits and make the vaccine technologies available to all, regardless of wealth.“Let us be clear: to deny life-saving health care anytime, but particularly during a global health crisis, is unacceptable. Our vaccination efforts will only be successful if vaccination efforts in the developing world happen simultaneously. This waiver would not only save lives, but protect against new variants that threaten the progress we have made. This is exactly the kind of leadership the world needs right now. We must work together to get this done.”Working with activists and colleagues in Congress, Sen. Sanders has called on the WTO multiple times already this year to waive international intellectual property (IP) rules to boost production of COVID-19 vaccines around the world, including letters urging the Biden Administration to take action.Read the November letter to President Bidenhere.Read the April letter to President Bidenhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Colleagues Push for WTO Waiver on Barriers Blocking Vaccine Production Around the World
Date: November 23, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tuesday sent aletterto the Biden Administration pushing for a waiver of international intellectual property (IP) rules at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to boost production of COVID-19 vaccines for the developing world. This comes as the WTO Ministerial Conference is set to begin next Tuesday, November 30.

This waiver is vital to boosting production of vaccines in low-income countries where only 5 percent of people are vaccinated. Higher vaccination rates in these countries would not only save lives, but reduce the likelihood of new variants that could jeopardize progress on the pandemic. Since the Administration’s May announcement of support for a vaccine patent waiver, little progress has been made. The WTO Ministerial Conference presents a crucial opportunity to get a deal.

In the letter to President Biden, the senators wrote:

“A waiver will unlock local production of vaccines in developing countries, which is necessary both to overcome absolute shortfalls in supply and to ensure people in the developing world have reliable access to vaccines. The only way to end the pandemic is to increase vaccination rates to ensure that new variants cannot emerge from mass outbreaks. Today, only 5 percent of people in low-income countries are vaccinated.

“The United States and European Union nations have provided billions to pharmaceutical companies for the development and distribution of the most effective vaccines,” they continued. “By securing a waiver agreement at the WTO Ministerial, your Administration can demonstrate real and impactful American global leadership. If the Ministerial Conference cannot deliver a solution, the WTO — and the wealthy nations blocking the waiver — will continue to lose credibility with the developing world. We urge you to seize this opportunity to engage actively and productively at the WTO deliver on your promise to defeat the pandemic,” the Senators concluded.

The letter was also signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ben Lujan (D-N.M.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).

“I applaud Democrats in the House of Representatives for uniting to pass the Build Back Better Act. Now the legislation comes to the Senate where I hope to see it strengthened in a number of ways.

“The American people overwhelmingly demand that we ask the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. That’s what we must do. The American people overwhelmingly demand that we take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower the cost of prescription drugs. That’s what we must do. The American people overwhelmingly demand that we expand Medicare to cover dental, eyeglasses and hearing aids. That’s what we must do. The American people understand that we must act now to combat the existential threat of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. That’s what we must do.

“The Senate has an opportunity to make this a truly historic piece of legislation. We will listen to the demands of the American people and strengthen the Build Back Better Act.”

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday delivered remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate ahead of consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act.

Sen. Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:

“M. President, day after day, here on the floor and back in their states, many of my colleagues tell the American people how deeply concerned they are about the deficit and the national debt. They tell us that we just don’t have enough money to expand Medicare to cover dental care, eyeglasses and hearing aids; we can’t guarantee paid family and medical leave; we can’t provide two years of free community college; and we can’t build the amount of affordable housing the country desperately needs; or address the climate crisis to the degree that we should if we want to protect the well-being of future generations.“Yet, today, the Senate will begin consideration of an annual defense budget that costs $778 billion – $37 billion more than President Trump’s last defense budget and $25 billion more than what President Biden requested.“And by the way, all this for an agency, the Department of Defense, that continues to have massive cost overruns year after year and is the only major government agency not to successfully complete an independent audit.“Isn’t it strange how even as we end the longest war in our nation’s history, the war in Afghanistan, concerns about the deficit and national debt seem to melt away under the influence of the powerful Military Industrial Complex?“But that’s not all. Further, it is likely that the so-called ‘competition bill’ will be attached to the National Defense Authorization Act. This $250 billion bill includes $52 billion in corporate welfare, with no strings attached, for a handful of extremely profitable microchip companies. Oh! And by the way, this bill also contains a $10 billion handout to Jeff Bezos, one of the wealthiest people in our country, for space exploration.“Combining these two pieces of legislation would push the price tag of the defense bill to over $1 trillion for one year. Meanwhile, Congress has spent month after month discussing the Build Back Better Act, which on an annual basis costs far less than the Pentagon budget, and whether we can afford to protect the working families of our country, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor, and the future of our planet.“If there was ever a moment in American history when we needed to fundamentally alter our national priorities, now is that time.“Whether it is transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels, guaranteeing paid family and medical leave, taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, addressing our housing crisis, or providing child care and Pre-K – now is the time for change, real change.“But instead of addressing these major issues that impact the working families of our country, Congress comes together, Democrats and Republicans, with minimal debate to support an exploding Pentagon budget which is now higher than the next 13 nations combined, and represents more than half of our discretionary spending.“Incredibly, after adjusting for inflation, we are now spending more on the military than we did during the height of the Cold War or during the wars in Vietnam and Korea.“M. President, that is why I have introduced an amendment with Senator Markey to reduce the military budget by $25 billion, down to what President Biden requested.“Let me be clear: this is not a radical idea, it is the military spending amount proposed by the President of the United States and the amount requested by the Department of Defense.“I should also point out that this extraordinary level of military spending comes at a time when the Department of Defense is the only agency of our federal government that has not been able to pass an independent audit, and when defense contractors are making enormous profits while paying their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages.“And let’s not forget the so-called ‘competition bill’ that is likely to be attached to the NDAA. I am deeply concerned about the provisions in this bill which will provide more than $53 billion in emergency appropriations for the microchip industry, with no strings attached. Let me repeat that. We are talking about more than $53 billion in Federal funds – and, by the way, I suspect there will be more taxpayer money coming to these corporations from State and local government –with no strings attached.“Do we need to expand the microchip industry in this country so that we become less dependent on foreign countries? Yes. But we can accomplish that goal without throwing money at these companies with no protections for the taxpayer.“In total, I suspect 5 major semi-conductor companies will likely receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Analog Devices and NVIDIA (NAH-VIDIA). I should point out that these 5 companies made nearly $35 billion in profits last year and spent more than $18 billion buying back their own stock. These 5 corporations paid their CEOs a combined $85 million in compensation last year.“Further, this is an industry that received nearly $6 billion in government subsidies and loans over the years. It is an industry that has shut down over 780 manufacturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs in the last 20 years – 29% of its workforce – while moving most of its production overseas.“Let’s be clear about what is happening here. In order to make more profits, these companies took government money and then offshored good American jobs. Now, for that bad behavior, these same companies are getting some $53 billion in no-strings corporate welfare to undo the damage that they did.“M. President, that is why I have introduced Senate amendment No. 4722. This amendment would prevent microchip companies from receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue warrants to the Federal Government.“If private companies are going to benefit from over $53 billion in taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders. In other words, all this amendment says is that if these companies want taxpayer assistance, we are not going to socialize all of the risks and privatize all of the profits.“And let me be very clear. This is not a radical idea. These exact conditions were imposed on corporations that received taxpayer assistance in the bipartisan CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96 to 0. In other words, every Member of the U.S. Senate has already voted for the conditions that are in the amendment. And CARES was not the first time that Congress passed warrants and equity stakes tied to government assistance. During the 2008 financial crisis, Congress required all companies taking TARP funds to issue warrants and equity stakes to the Federal Government.“In addition to making sure that companies allow for warrants and equity stakes, this amendment would require that these companies cannot buy back their own stock, not outsource American jobs, not repeal existing collective bargaining agreements, and remain neutral in any union organizing effort.“And here’s something else that is in this ‘competition bill’ that must be addressed. Unbelievably, this bill would provide some $10 billion in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America, for his space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in America. This is beyond laughable, and I will be introducing an amendment to strike this provision.“It is not acceptable that the two wealthiest people in this country – Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos – take control over our space efforts to return to the Moon and maybe even the extraordinary accomplishment of getting to Mars.“Let me say a few words about why there is so much waste, fraud and abuse at the Pentagon. It has a lot to do with the fact that the Defense Department remains the only federal agency in America that hasn’t been able to pass an independent audit – 30 years after Congress required it to do so.“Let us not forget that on September 10, 2001, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, ‘Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it’s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.’“And yet, 20 years after Mr. Rumsfeld’s statement, the Pentagon has still not passed a clean audit despite the fact that the Pentagon controls assets in excess of $3.1 trillion, or roughly 78 percent of what the entire federal government owns. Just this week, the Pentagon announced that it will fail its fourth consecutive financial audit in a row.“That’s why I have introduced an amendment with Senator Grassley that would require the Pentagon to pass a clean audit this year. If it fails to do so, one percent of its budget would be returned to the Treasury each year until it obtains a clean audit opinion.“I believe this is a moment in history when it would be a good idea for all of my colleagues, and the American people, to remember what former Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower said in 1953. And, as we all recall, Eisenhower was a four star general who led the allied forces to victory in Europe during World War II. Eisenhower said: ‘Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.’“What Eisenhower said was true 68 years ago, and it is true today.“If the horrific coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything it is that national security means a lot more than building bombs, missiles, jet fighters, tanks, submarines, nuclear warheads and other weapons of mass destruction. National security also means doing everything we can to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, many of whom have been abandoned by our government for decades.“M. President, when we analyze the Defense Department budget it is important to note that Congress has appropriated so much money for the Defense Department that the Pentagon literally does not know what to do with it. According to the GAO, over the course of 11 years, the Pentagon returned an astonishing $128 billion in excess funds back to the Treasury.“And, over the past two decades, virtually every major defense contractor in the United States has paid millions of dollars in fines and settlements for misconduct and fraud – all while making huge profits on those government contracts.“Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies have paid over $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct.“Further, M. President, I find it interesting that the very same defense contractors that have been found guilty or reached settlements for fraud are also paying their CEOs excessive compensation packages.“In 2020 alone, the CEO’s of the top five contractors received a total of $105.5 million in compensation. From 2017 to 2020, total compensation for major executives at all five contractors topped $1 billion. These companies are for all intent and purposes are governmental agencies where the CEOs make over a hundred times more than the Secretary of Defense.“And, when compared with the average newly enlisted service member, the top defense contractor CEOs are earning 500 percent more in compensation. It’s not too surprising, therefore, that we have a revolving door where our military people end up on the boards of directors of these major defense companies.“Moreover, M. President, as the GAO has told us, there are massive cost overruns in the Defense Department’s acquisition budget that we have got to address.“According to GAO, the Pentagon’s $1.8 trillion acquisition portfolio currently suffers from more than $628 billion in cost overruns with much of the cost growth taking place after production.“GAO tells us that DOD’s acquisition portfolio ‘has accumulated over $628 billion (or 54 percent) in total cost growth since program start, most of which is unrelated to the increase in quantities purchased. Additionally, over the same time period, time required to deliver initial capabilities has increased by 30 percent, resulting in an average delay of more than 2 years.’“M. President, the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan concluded in 2011 that $31-$60 billion spent in Iraq and Afghanistan had been lost to fraud and waste.“Separately, in 2015, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported that the Pentagon could not account for $45 billion in funding for reconstruction projects.“And more recently, an audit conducted by Ernst & Young for the Defense Logistics Agency found that it could not properly account for some $800 million in construction projects.“In 2019, while carrying out current audit efforts, the Navy found an entire warehouse full of $126 million in equipment that it didn’t know existed. Some of the equipment included fighter jets that had been retired over a decade earlier.“M. President, that is unacceptable.“I have also filed an amendment with Senator Markey and Rep. Ro Khanna in the House to finally end all U.S. support for the Saudi war effort in Yemen. This amendment simply codifies a prohibition on support for the Saudi-war that already passed both houses of Congress in 2019 in a bipartisan way. At that time, and in 2019, various officials now in the Biden-Harris Administration signed a letter supporting this measure. The House already passed this amendment for the third consecutive year. It is long overdue for this provision to be included in the final defense policy bill that is sent to the President’s desk.“In addition to Yemen, I have long-standing concerns about the situation in Gaza. That’s why I have introduced an amendment to request a series of reports on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and on steps that the United States could take to ease that crisis and bring desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the Palestinians in Gaza.“Gaza has been suffering for years under a set of extremely severe restrictions – on the movement of people, on the import and export of food and other goods – which are supposedly intended to punish the militant group Hamas, which rules inside Gaza. But it is the people themselves, families, whole communities, who are suffering from these restrictions. Israeli security leaders themselves have said for years that addressing this humanitarian crisis is something we can and must do to avoid further conflicts. So these reports I have requested will look at what might be done in that regard.“And as we consider this massive defense bill, spending billions of dollars sending our young men and women into harm’s way, I find it unacceptable that Congress cannot come together to adequately provide services for our veterans after their separation from the military.“In my home state of Vermont, veterans who are eligible for dental care at the VA have no access to a VA dental clinic. In fact, Vermont is the only state in the nation that does not have a VA dental clinic. That is why I have introduced an amendment to the NDAA to require the Department of Veterans Affairs to maintain a dental clinic in every state in the nation, so all veterans have access to the care they deserve.“Let me be clear, I believe in a strong military. But we cannot keep giving more money to the Pentagon than it needs when millions of children in this country are food insecure and 140 million Americans can’t afford the basic necessities of life without going into debt.“In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warned us that ‘a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.’“The time is long overdue to listen to Dr. King.“At a time when, in the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people are struggling paycheck to paycheck, when close to 40 million Americans are living in poverty, and when over 500,000 Americans are homeless, we are approaching spiritual death.“At a time when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, and when millions of Americans are in danger of going hungry, we are approaching spiritual death.“At a time when tens of thousands of Americans die each year because they can’t afford to get to a doctor on time, and one out of five Americans can’t afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, we are approaching spiritual death.“Now, at this moment of unprecedented national crisis, it is time to rethink what we value as a society and to fundamentally transform our national priorities.“And as President Eisenhower said as he left office in 1961: ‘In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.’”

Title: NEWS: Sanders and Seven Colleagues Stand in Solidarity with More Than 30,000 Health Care Workers Ahead of Strike
Date: November 12, 2021
Subtitle:

WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Friday, along with seven of his Senate colleagues, sent a letter to Kaiser Permanente Chair and CEO Greg Adams in support of the more than 30,000 nurses and health care workers planning to strike unless negotiations for a fair contract improve. The strike is set to take place November 15 with workers at health care facilities in California, Colorado, Washington D.C., Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington.

“These workers have been on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19,” wrote the senators. “They risked their lives to save patients – showing up to work despite not being provided basic protective equipment. We’ve been told that some were even forced to sleep in their cars and hotels to protect their families. These employees are heroes and heroines and should be treated as such. Sadly, you have taken another approach.”

Sanders and his colleagues, Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), urgently reminded Adams that this strike comes after Kaiser health care workers and their families have been on the frontlines of this terrible pandemic – putting themselves and their loved ones at risk, working longer hours and in worse conditions – all while the company and its leadership raked in record corporate profits.

The senators wrote, “Mr. Adams: During the peak of the global pandemic, in 2020, your company made $2.2 billion in operating profits. Let’s be clear. Those company profits did not occur by accident. They occurred because your employees were on the job, working tirelessly in the midst of a life- threatening pandemic. Now, at a time when Kaiser is sitting on $44.5 billion in cash reserves and your insured membership has grown to 12.5 million, the company wishes to diminish the safety, security, and wellbeing of its workers, rather than improve them. That’s just not right. Your employees deserve better.”

The Kaiser strike comes amidst awaveof worker protests across industries and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations this year. Sanders also recently led aletterof support, along with six of his Senate colleagues, for the Kellogg workers striking in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Veterans Day
Date: November 11, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 11 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Thursday issued the following statement regarding Veterans Day:

“We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, one which we will never truly be able to repay. As a longtime member and former Chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I believe that on Veterans Day, and every day, we honor the extraordinary sacrifice and bravery of our nation’s veterans, and the families who stand by their side in service to our country.

“As we recognize, honor, and remember their service, we must, as a community, do more. We must commit ourselves to keeping America’s promise to our veterans and servicemembers, just as they kept their promise to us. That means making certain that veterans and their families get all the benefits they earned through their service, on time and without delay. That means ensuring access to the best quality health care this country can provide by protecting and strengthening the Department of Veterans Affairs. That means ensuring no veteran goes hungry or is forced to sleep on the streets. And it means ending injustice, including making sure those who served their country are not deported, as well as doing right by those exposed to toxic substances and with bad paper discharges.

“I believe that if someone takes an oath to serve their country, to go off to war, to risk their life or risk coming home wounded – in body or in spirit – then that government has a duty to make good on its commitment. I am honored to work every day to keep that promise to our veterans and their families.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Holds Press Conference with Menendez on SALT
Date: November 3, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Wednesday held a press conference to discuss the rumored changes to the state and local tax deduction proposed to be included in the reconciliation bill:Sen. Sanders’ remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:

“At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich are becoming richer and working families are struggling, the job of Congress is to demand tax fairness for working families and to make certain that the wealthiest people in this country begin to pay their fair share of taxes.“Unfortunately, in 2017, the Trump tax plan, which was supported by every Republican, moved us in exactly the wrong direction. The vast majority of the tax breaks in that proposal went to the wealthiest people in our country and the largest corporations – the people who needed it the least – and resulted in a $2 trillion increase in our national debt.“One of the negative aspects of the Trump tax plan was to limit deductions on state and local taxes to $10,000. That resulted in millions of middle class and working class Americans being forced to pay more in federal taxes. That was a regressive and unfair proposal, and this Congress must rectify it.“Unfortunately, as some of you may know, a proposal has been recently circulating which would completely eliminate the SALT cap. While the $10,000 cap is much too low, eliminating the cap entirely would result in a massive tax break for the wealthiest families in this country. The multimillionaires and billionaires who own mansions in exclusive neighborhoods, and who can afford to make extremely expensive purchases do not need a tax break.“According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a 5-year repeal, which is what some are talking about, would cost roughly $475 billion, with $400 billion of that tax cut going to the top 5% of households. According to this non-partisan organization, if this proposal were to go into effect, the top 5% would receive a net tax cut of $30 billion a year – even after including all of the other provisions to increase taxes on the wealthy that are currently in the Build Back Better Act.“At a time when Democrats are correctly demanding that the wealthy finally pay their fair share of taxes, it would be absurd and hypocritical to provide the richest people in the country with a massive tax break.“That’s not just Bernie Sanders talking. Jason Furman, President Obama’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, recently tweeted, ‘My guess is the majority of Americans with a net worth of $50 to $300 million would get a tax cut under the Build Back Better plan with a full repeal of SALT.’ He concludes by saying ‘that’s obscene.’“So, if completely eliminating the cap on state and local tax exemption is regressive and unfair, what is the solution? The answer is obvious. We should eliminate that cap for families making $400,000 or less, not for millionaires and billionaires. And we should make that permanent. This would not only provide tax relief to millions of middle income and working class families, it would be deficit-neutral.“I was delighted to hear from Senator Menendez that he has a very similar perspective on this issue and our offices have agreed in principle on a compromise proposal that would eliminate the SALT cap on middle class families who need it the most and ensure that millionaires and billionaires don’t receive any of the benefit. Over ten years, this proposal would be deficit neutral and the Build Back Better Act would be fully paid for by demanding that the wealthiest Americans and most profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes.“We have heard reports that the House bill may include a proposal to raise the SALT cap to $72,500 for all Americans, including the wealthy. This approach would cost over $50 billion a year and would provide 37% of its benefits to the top 1%. In my view, that is not an acceptable compromise. We should be substantially increasing taxes on the top 1%, not giving the wealthiest people in America a tax break.”

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Tuesday issued the following statement on the changes to the state and local tax deduction proposed to be included in the reconciliation bill:

“According to media reports, Democratic negotiators are working on a repeal of the SALT deduction cap for up to five years, which would cost $475 billion and give the richest 5% $400 billion in tax cuts. As a result, the top 1% would pay lower taxes after passage of the Build Back Better plan than they did after the Trump tax cut in 2017. This is beyond unacceptable.

“At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the last thing we should be doing is giving more tax breaks to the very rich. Democrats campaigned and won on an agenda that demands that the very wealthy finally pay their fair share, not one that gives them more tax breaks. I am open to a compromise approach which protects the middle class in high tax states. I will not support more tax breaks for billionaires.”

Thursday, along with six of his Senate colleagues, sent a letter to Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane in support of the workers striking for better wages and working conditions across the company’s factories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee.“Over the past several weeks, we have been closely following the efforts of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) workers who have gone on strike at the Kellogg’s cereal plants in Battle Creek, Omaha, Lancaster, and Memphis,” the senators wrote. “We write you today to express our strong support for their goals and to express our sincere hope that a fair contract will be reached as soon as possible between the Kellogg Company and BCTGM.”Sanders and his colleagues, Sens.

Let’s be clear. Those company profits did not occur by accident. They occurred because your employees were on the job, working tirelessly in the midst of a pandemic, providing food security for families across the world. Now, at a time when Kellogg is making record profits, the company wishes to diminish the security and wellbeing of its workers, rather than improve them. That’s just not right. Your employees deserve better.”The ongoing Kellogg strike comes amidst awaveof worker protests across industries and states, including some 185 strikes at 255 locations this year, at least 40 of which occurred this month alone.Read the full letterhere.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Introduces Legislation to Expand Veterans Dental and Health Care
Date: October 20, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 – Ahead of a Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Wednesday introduced two bills to expand and improve comprehensive health care for veterans.

The Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act of 2021 – co-sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) – and the Veterans State Eligibility Standardization Act of 2021 will ensure universal dental care coverage for all veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and eliminate long-standing barriers to health care for veterans across the country.

“If a country is worth anything, it’s in how we treat the people who put their lives on the line to defend us,”said Sen. Sanders.“As the former chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I have seen up close the pain, death, and despair caused by war and its aftermath. Honoring that extraordinary sacrifice and bravery is one of the most important commitments we have as a country. That means making sure our veterans and their families have access to the best and most comprehensive health care, including dental care, our country can provide. With this legislation, we will strengthen the VA health care system so that all veterans can get the care they were promised, and no veteran is left behind.”

“This legislation will bolster the VA’s whole health approach, expanding essential dental care access to all veterans enrolled in the VA system,”said Sen. Blumenthal.“Veterans across the U.S. and Connecticut, including those in rural and underserved communities, deserve quality and affordable health care services. By opening new VA dental clinics, promoting dental health education, and recruiting dentists to work at the VA, the Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act will ensure dental care is part of the preventative and emergency care services our nation’s bravest can access.”

“Dental care is health care, however, due to current VA eligibility restrictions, the vast majority of America’s veterans are prevented from accessing this benefit – making it critical that we expand coverage,”said Sen. Booker.“This important legislation would eliminate current restrictions to ensure that the VA has the necessary staff and facilities in all states to provide dental care to veterans. We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid, and this legislation is a necessary step forward in honoring their service and sacrifice.”

“Today, dental care is not treated like the vital health care it is and only a small fraction of veterans are eligible to receive dental care through the VA because of stringent eligibility requirements,”said Sen. Gillibrand.“With the VA’s Dental Insurance Program set to expire at the end of the year, now is the time to prioritize dental health care and pass the Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act of 2021. This bill would help eliminate eligibility restrictions and make dental care more affordable and accessible to all veterans.”

“Dental care is a key part of comprehensive health care, and an essential part of fulfilling our promise to holistically address the needs of veterans in Hawaii and across the country,”said Sen. Hirono.“This legislation would make needed and overdue updates to the care that veterans can receive through VA.”

“Our veterans have served our country with honor and dignity, and yet millions are locked out of critical VA benefits such as dental care due to strict eligibility restrictions at the agency,”said Sen. Menendez.“Veterans in New Jersey and across the country deserve to have access to the resources and benefits they need to live healthy and productive lives after their military service, and that’s why I am proud to be supporting this important piece of legislation that will expand access to dental care for millions of veterans and support them in maintaining good dental hygiene and overall health.”

The VA hasreportedthat out of the 9.2 million veterans enrolled in VA health care, only about 1.4 million are eligible for comprehensive dental care. However, in 2020, VA dental services managed the care of only 402,000 eligible veterans as well as an additional 61,000 due to medical necessity. Only 80,000 purchased dental insurance through the VA Dental Insurance Program and in 2020, the decrease in veteran enrollment and compensation and pension exams due to the pandemic created an estimated backlog of 2.5 million dental procedures.

The Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act of 2021 will eliminate the current eligibility restrictions for VA dental care and expand eligibility to all veterans receiving VA health care. It will also work to address the shortage of dentists in the U.S. by incentivizing dental school enrollment and service to our nation’s veterans, and ensure the VA maintains dental clinics in all states to meet the needs of veterans from all parts of the country.

Poor dental hygiene is directly linked to other chronic health care conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, upper respiratory disease, dementia, and diabetes, leading to increased overall health care costs. In 2016, Avalere estimated that if Medicare covered initial and ongoing gum disease treatment for beneficiaries with diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, it would save Medicare $63.5 billion over a decade. Each $1 of new spending from dental coverage saved approximately $10 in Medicare costs, primarily from reduced hospitalizations and emergency room visits.

The Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act would ensure the VA educates veterans on their eligibility for dental care and the importance of dental hygiene for an individual’s overall health; improve veterans’ overall physical health; and provide a reduction in long-term taxpayer spending on VA health care.

In addition to Sens. Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Booker (D-N.J.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Menendez (D-N.J.), the Veterans Dental Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act of 2021 has the support of a wide array of veteran and health care organizations, including: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), The American Heart Association, The American Legion, AMVETS, The Coalition of Veteran Organizations (CVO), Common Defense, Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Justice in Aging, Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), Modern Military Association of America (MMAA), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), and VoteVets.

Running parallel to the fight to guarantee veterans universal dental care is the effort to simplify and expand the eligibility process to receive health care through the VA. While more than 9 million veterans are enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), approximately 5.6 million veterans have no health insurance and are unable to get care at the VA. Currently, veterans face a complex set of requirements and enrollment processes to determine eligibility for health care coverage from the VA, including more than 3,000 different geographic-based income eligibility thresholds across the nation.

To simplify the system and ensure more veterans can get the care they need at the VA, the Veterans State Eligibility Standardization Act of 2021 will limit the number of geographic regions to one per state and set the income eligibility threshold in each state to the most generous in that state. This policy will continue to use Housing and Urban Development (HUD) metrics to determine the most generous income eligibility threshold in each state and set each state’s eligibility threshold at 100% of the highest median income in each state. For the many brave veterans who fought to protect our nation and have been left with no affordable means of securing quality health care, this small administrative change will significantly expand eligibility, particularly for veterans in rural areas, to receive care through the VA.

The Veterans State Eligibility Standardization Act of 2021 is supported by the Coalition of Veteran Organizations (CVO), Common Defense, The American Legion (TAL), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), and VoteVets.

Title: NEWS: Sanders Statement on Why Americans Don’t Know What’s in the Build Back Better Plan
Date: October 15, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Oct. 15 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Friday issued the following statement after polls showed too many Americans still don’t know what’s in the Build Back Better agenda:

“Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better legislation – and the need to lower prescription drug costs, expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision, greatly improve home health care, make child care and housing affordable, establish Paid Family and Medical Leave and address the existential threat of climate change. And the polling numbers go astronomically high when people understand that this $3.5 trillion bill will be paid for by demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.

“Yet, polling also shows that despite President Biden having introduced this proposal five months ago, a majority of Americans have very little knowledge as to what is in this bill – one of the most consequential pieces of legislation for working people in the modern history of our country. Americans can be for the bill. They can be opposed to the bill. But it is absurd that so many of them don’t know what is in the bill.

“Why is that? There are a number of reasons but, at the top of the list, is the reality that the mainstream media has done an exceptionally poor job in covering what actually is in the legislation. There have been endless stories about the politics of passing Build Back Better, the role of the president, the conflicts in the House and the Senate, the opposition of two senators, the size of the bill, etc. – but very limited coverage as to what the provisions of the bill are and the crises for working people that they address.

“The foundations of American democracy are threatened not only by extremism, but by ignorance and lack of knowledge. It is hard to ask people to have faith in their government when they have little understanding of what their government is trying to do. Build Back Better is an enormously important piece of legislation. The American people have a right to know what’s in it. My hope is that mainstream media will fulfill their responsibilities and make that happen.”

Title: PREPARED REMARKS: Sanders Statement on Reconciliation and Sen. Manchin’s Comments
Date: October 6, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Wednesday held a press conference at the Senate Radio and T.V. Studio Gallery on the budget reconciliation bill and Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) comments about the legislation. His remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:

“As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I want to say a few words about the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that a number of us are fighting for and I’d also like to make some brief comments about what Senator Manchin said today about the bill.

“First, let’s be clear. Poll after poll including polls in West Virginia show us that what we are trying to do in this legislation is enormously popular.

“But it’s not just the American people. 48 out of 50 members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate support this bill. And 210 members, 96% of the Democratic caucus in the House, support this bill. And, by the way, the President of the United States supports this bill.

“And while we’re at it let me tell you who is vigorously opposed to this bill. The pharmaceutical industry is spending hundreds of millions of dollars in opposition because they don’t want us to lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs.

“The health insurance companies are spending huge amounts because they don’t want us to expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing aids and eyeglasses.“The fossil fuel industry, the coal companies and the oil companies are spending millions despite the fact that the scientists are virtually unanimous in telling us that we’ve got to end our dependence on fossil fuels and move to renewable energy and energy efficiency.

“And the billionaire class is spending a fortune because they love the idea of some of the richest people in this country and largest corporations not paying, in a given year, a nickel in federal income tax.

“In other words, we are taking on some of the most powerful special interests in this country who will end up spending many hundreds of millions in order to prevent us from protecting the interests of working families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor, and protecting the planet for future generations.

“Senator Manchin talks about not wanting to see our country become ‘an entitlement society.’ Well, I’m not exactly sure what that means.

“Does that mean that we end the $300 direct payments for working class parents which have cut childhood poverty in half in America? Is protecting working families and cutting childhood poverty an ‘entitlement’?

“Does Senator Manchin think we should once again have one of the highest levels of childhood poverty of any major country on earth?

“At a time when millions of seniors have teeth in their mouths which are rotting, when they can’t afford hearing aids to communicate with their grandkids, when they can’t afford a pair of glasses to read a newspaper, does Senator Manchin believe that seniors are not entitled to digest their food and that they are not entitled to hear and see properly? Is that really too much to ask in the richest country on earth?

“Does Senator Manchin not believe that seniors and people with disabilities are entitled to stay in their homes, rather than be forced into expensive and understaffed nursing homes? If that’s what he believes than let him tell us that.

“Does Senator Manchin not believe that we have to end the absurdity of paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – sometimes ten times more for a particular drug than any other country?

“Does Senator Manchin believe that we should be the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave? And that working mothers should not be able to stay at home with a sick kid? Are workers not entitled to that?

“Does Senator Manchin believe that working class parents in Vermont and West Virginia should have to pay 25 or 30 percent of their incomes on childcare so that they can go to work and make sure that their kids are decently taken care of?

“Are the children of this country not entitled to high quality childcare and pre-K education?

“Does Senator Manchin not believe that working families in this country are entitled to affordable housing and that we should not have some 600,000 people in America including many veterans who are homeless?

“Does Senator Manchin not believe that at a time when we have a major labor shortage because our young people lack the skills they need that they are not entitled to at least two years of free community college?

“And, perhaps, most importantly, does Senator Manchin not believe what the scientists are telling us that we face an existential threat regarding climate change, and that it is absolutely imperative that we move boldly to cut carbon emissions?

“Are our children and grandchildren not entitled to live in a healthy and habitable environment?

“Senator Manchin has been critical of the $3.5 trillion proposal that many of us support.  But the time is long overdue for him to tell us with specificity what he wants and does not want and explain that to the American people.

“I look forward to working with Senator Manchin and everyone else to pass a strong reconciliation bill and a bipartisan infrastructure bill.”

WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 — Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement Wednesday on upcoming votes regarding infrastructure and reconciliation legislation:“In the coming weeks, Congress has the opportunity to pass the most consequential economic legislation since the New Deal. We can create millions of good-paying jobs as we repair our crumbling infrastructure, address the climate crisis, and finally confront the long-neglected crises facing millions of low-income and working-class families across this country. But we can accomplish those goals only if we stick to our original agreement.“We voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill with the clear commitment that the two pieces of the package would move together along a dual track. Abandoning the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act and passing the infrastructure bill first would be in violation of that agreement. Congress must not undercut the President’s proposals that will create new opportunities for America’s families and workers. The House of Representatives should wait to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill until the budget reconciliation bill, which enacts the rest of the President’s Build Back Better agenda, is sent to the President’s desk.“Now is the time to pass both of these major pieces of legislation. We have no time to waste. We strongly support the Congressional Progressive Caucus and other members in the House who have said they intend to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill only once the Build Back Better Act is passed. That is what we agreed to, it’s what the American people want, and it’s the only path forward for this Congress.”

Title: NEWS: Chairman Sanders Statement on Medicare Drug Price Negotiation
Date: September 15, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 15 – Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders Wednesday issued the following statement after the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives failed to include a critical provision allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices during a markup of reconciliation legislation:

“I am very disappointed in the 29-29 vote on prescription drugs that was taken today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. I understand that the pharmaceutical industry owns the Republican Party and that no Republican voted for this bill, but there is no excuse for every Democrat not supporting it.“The good news is that the full Congress must and will do far better. At a time when the drug companies are charging us by far the highest prices in the world, Congress must demand that Medicare negotiate prices with this extremely greedy and powerful industry. Year after year, the pharmaceutical industry makes extraordinary profits and provides their CEOs with obscenely high compensation packages. Meanwhile, one out of five Americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors write, and thousands die each year because they lack the money to buy the medicine they need.“The pharmaceutical industry has spent over $4.5 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past 20 years and has hired some 1,200 lobbyists to get Congress to do its bidding. They are the most powerful industry on Capitol Hill. Nonetheless, the American people are demanding that Congress stand up to them and finally lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs by requiring Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry. Now is the time for Congress to show courage and stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. The American people will not accept surrender.”

Title: NEWS: More than 2,000 Vermonters Turned Out for Sanders Town Meetings on Reconciliation Bill over Labor Day Weekend
Date: September 7, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
Sen. Bernie Sanders held five town meetings – with live music, food, and free COVID-19 vaccine services offered – in Springfield, Newport, St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro, and Middlebury.

BURLINGTON, September 7 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held five outdoor town meetings across Vermont over Labor Day weekend – with live music, food, and free COVID-19 vaccine services made available – in Springfield, Newport, St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro, and Middlebury. The town meetings were an opportunity for communities to come together, celebrate, and discuss the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, including how it will combat climate change and make critical investments in working families in Vermont and across the country.

“It is easy to become disillusioned,” said Sen. Sanders. “But what we cannot afford to do is allow demagogues to divide us up. Look, we may have differences of opinion. I am sure that not everybody here agrees with everything that I do. That’s okay. It’s called democracy. But we cannot have attacks against people because of the color of their skin, or where they were born, or their sexual orientation, or their religion. I am absolutely convinced that if we have the courage and the determination to stand together and fight for justice – economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice – not only can we address the enormous crises that we face, but I believe we can move this country in a much stronger and better direction.”

Throughout the swing, Sanders spoke about the budget reconciliation bill. He also highlighted the impact of theAmerican Rescue Plan, which passed the Senate in March 2021, and took questions from the audience at each event on a range topics, including civic education, housing, climate change, health care, voting rights, and unemployment. As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sandersintroduced the $3.5 trillion FY 2022 budget resolution, which includes reconciliation instructions for Congress to craft sweeping legislation to invest in the long-neglected needs of the working class.

On the reconciliation bill, Sanders said, “I hope very much that if we can pass this legislation, there will be a lot of people who say, ‘you know what, maybe democracy works and maybe, just maybe, we can have a government that works for all of us and not just the wealthy few.’ For too many years the government has been there for the wealthy and the powerful. Now is the time for the government to be there for the working families of this country. And that’s what this bill is about. If passed, this bill will be the most consequential piece of legislation for working people, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor since FDR and the New Deal of the 1930s. Let’s get it done.”

In Springfield on Saturday, Sen. Sanders was joined at the Comtu Cascade Park by 320 people, as well as speakers Congressman Peter Welch, Josh Dufresne, Mark Curran, Ariana Cioffi, and Bob Flint. Music was provided by Nick Charyk and members of the Western Terrestrials; food by Riverside Restaurant.

Sanders kicked off the Sunday swing in Newport at Gardner Memorial Park, where he was joined by 280 guests, as well as speakers State Senator Bobby Starr, State Representative Katherine Sims, Matt Maxwell, and John Castle. The Bob MacKenzie Blues Band provided music and Hoagie’s Pizza & Pasta provided food. Later in the day, at the St. Johnsbury Welcome Center, Sanders was joined by 330 people as well as speakers State Representative Chip Troiano, Jenny Nelson, Brandon Burmeister, and Michael Costa, with music by Dave Keller and food by Sunshine Catering.

On Monday, 500 people turned out to see Sanders speak at the Brattleboro Common. Sanders was joined in Brattleboro by speakers Vermont Senate Pro Tempore Becca Balint, State Representative Emilie Kornheiser, Lily Charkey, Sharon Levenson, and Orly Munzing. Music was provided by Saints & Liars and food by Top of the Hill Grill. Sanders closed out the weekend with 600 people turning out on the Middlebury Town Green. Sanders was joined in Middlebury by speakers Congressman Peter Welch, Bill McKibben, Dr. Deborah Richter, Iris Hsiang, Jubilee McGill, and Jill Charbonneau, with music provided by Men of Distinction and food by Pratt’s Store.

All events were held outside, all attendees were required to follow Vermont Department of Health guidance, and masks were encouraged regardless of vaccination status. Free COVID-19 vaccinations, provided by Vermont non-profit Rescue Inc., were made available at each event without appointment.

Title: Sanders, Top Democrats Introduce Bill Raising Minimum Wage to $15
Date: January 26, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, January 26 – In apress conference today, incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) joined incoming Senate HELP Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.), House Committee on Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) to announce the introduction of legislation raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025.

The Raise the Wage Act of 2021 would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 in five steps over the next four years. Beginning in 2026, the federal minimum wage would be indexed to median wage growth. According to an independentanalysisconducted by the Economic Policy Institute, the Raise the Wage Act would increase wages for nearly 32 million Americans, including roughly a third of all Black workers and a quarter of all Latino workers.

“Let’s be clear. The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. No person in America can make it on $8, $10, or $12 an hour. In the United States of America a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage—at least $15 an hour. And when we do that, not only will we be lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, we will be providing a raise to over 33 million workers,”said Senator Sanders.“We can no longer tolerate millions of workers not being able to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. The time for talk is over. No more excuses. It is time for Congress to act to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.”

“Throughout this pandemic, Democrats and Republicans alike have joined together in rightly calling our frontline workers ‘heroes.’ But despite their tireless work and the risk of COVID exposure, too many of these workers are paid wages so low, they can’t afford to pay for even their most basic needs. And because of systemic inequities and discrimination, workers of color, and in particular, women of color, are much more likely to be paid poverty-level wages,”said Senator Murray, Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.“Democrats are asking for $15 an hour, because no one working 40 hours a week, should be making $15,000 a year. If we’re committed to an economy that works for everyone, we need one fair, livable wage for everyone—and that includes workers with disabilities, tipped workers and youth workers. We won’t accept carve-outs and we won’t accept leaving anyone behind.”

“Americans working 40 hours a week should be able to put food on the table and a roof over their families’ heads, but with the minimum wage stuck at $7.25, far too many are working hard and still in poverty,”said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.“Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is one step Congress should take right now, particularly with the COVID-19 crisis stretching families’ resources further than ever. I am happy to move forward with this group to make it happen and give the American people a raise.”

“This pandemic has pushed millions more Americans into poverty and we need to ensure that every working American is able to support themselves and their families,”said Senator Gillibrand.“Passing the Raise the Wage Act is more critical now than ever. Finally delivering a $15 minimum wage will benefit workers by lifting their families out of poverty and it will strengthen our economic recovery. We must keep fighting until all hardworking Americans can access basic economic security and a fair shot in our economy.”

“My colleagues and I have introduced this legislation raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour because Georgia’s working families are struggling to pay the bills, and they deserve a livable wage for an honest day’s work,”Senator Ossoff said.

“The coronavirus pandemic and economic crises have pulled back the veil on the unconscionable economic disparities that working women, low-income families and other vulnerable communities have faced for decades,”said Speaker Nancy Pelosi.“By re-introducing the Chair Bobby Scott’s Raise the Wage Act, which passed on a bipartisan basis in the previous Congress, the Democratic Congress is taking another strong and long-needed step to honor the dignity, dedication and contributions of millions of hard-working Americans.  This legislation is a key part of Democrats’ commitment to not only recover from these crises, but to Build Back Better – and to do so in a way that advances justice, prosperity and equality for all Americans.”

“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the $7.25 federal minimum wage was economically and morally indefensible. Now, the pandemic is highlighting the gross imbalance between the value of our workers and the wages they are paid.  Many of the essential workers who have braved a public health crisis to keep our economy moving are still not being paid enough to provide for themselves or their families. The Raise the Wage Act is a critical step toward lifting hardworking people out of poverty, addressing inequality, and ensuring that all Americans can share in the economic recovery.,”said Chairman Bobby Scott, Committee on Education and Labor.

“As a longtime organizer for working people who helped draft the resolution that made Seattle the first major city to enact a $15 minimum wage, I know that raising the wage is good for workers, families, businesses and the economy,”said Congresswoman Jayapal.“Now that we have a Democratic White House and a Democratic Senate, it is time for the People’s House to once again stand up for workers, fight for families and pass the Raise the Wage Act so we finally have a $15 minimum wage all across America.”

“Last Congress, I was proud to help lead the historic effort in the House to give Americans a raise. Floridians then followed suit and voted to increase our state minimum wage and put more money in the pockets of hard-working families,”said Congresswoman Murphy.“This bill is a reasonable step to boost our economy and ensure everyone who works hard in this great country can provide for themselves and their loved ones.”

“Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will change my life and let me tell my kids I can give them a better life than mine,”said Kansas City McDonald’s worker Fran Marion.“I’m so proud to join with leaders in Congress today as they reintroduce the Raise the Wage Act, which will give tens of millions of working families like mine the raise we so desperately need. Essential workers have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and we can’t wait for help any longer.”

“Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 will be a boost to the economy, and a boost to our sales. Raising wages is good business. Paying people fairly leads to greater staff retention, which reduces the cost of hiring and training new people to replace employees who leave. And fair pay leads to better quality, better ideas and better customer service,”said Mike Draper, owner of Raygun LLC, an Iowa-based clothing and home goods company and member of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage.

Read Sanders’ prepared remarks below:

“This country faces major economic crises.

“Real unemployment is now close to 12% and last month alone 140,000 workers lost their jobs.  Millions more face hunger, eviction and crushing debt.

“We have massive income and wealth inequality in America today.  Incredibly, during the pandemic, 650 billionaires in America have increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion, while millions of workers struggle to feed their kids.

“And, in the midst of all of that, we must never lose sight of the fact that over half of our workers are living paycheck to paycheck.  I’m talking about workers who are just one car accident, one medical emergency, one lost paycheck away from financial catastrophe.

“Let’s be clear.  This is the richest country in the history of the world.  We can no longer tolerate millions of our workers being unable to feed their families because they are working for starvation wages.

“Let’s be clear.  Nobody in America can survive on $7.25 an hour, $9 an hour or $12 an hour.  We need an economy in which all of our workers earn at least a living wage.

“It is a national disgrace that Congress has not passed an increase in the minimum wage since 2007 – 14 years ago.

“It is a national disgrace that the minimum wage has lost over 30 percent of its purchasing power since 1968.

“Yes. Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage – at least $15 an hour.  A job in the United States of America should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it.

“And when we increase that minimum wage to $15 an hour we will be giving over 32 million Americans a much needed raise.

“In fact, if the legislation we are introducing today becomes law, the average low-wage worker in America would receive an extra $3,300 – each and every year.

“And let’s be clear.  The overwhelming majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.  This is not a radical idea.  This is what the American people want.

“Since 1998, every time a state has had an initiative on the ballot to raise the minimum wage it has won – no matter if that state was red, blue or purple.

“In November 61% of the people in Florida – a state Joe Biden lost by 3 points – voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

“Eight states and over 40 cities have adopted laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

“During the last session of Congress, the House did the right thing under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Scott – and I applaud them for their efforts – and passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour – and I have no doubt that they will do it again this year.

“Now, this issue rests in the Senate.  It is my strong hope that a number of my Republican colleagues will come to their senses and understand that raising the minimum wage is not just a Democratic issue.

“No matter whether you are a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent – all of us understand that no one in America can make it on $8, $10 or $12 an hour.  We have got to raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour.

“But let me also say this.  If we cannot get enough Republicans to vote for this legislation under regular order, we cannot take no for an answer.

“We must understand that the issue of starvation wages is a national emergency.

“We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour through budget reconciliation by a simple majority vote in the Senate.

“And, as the incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, that is exactly what I am fighting to do.

“This is not a new concept.  If the Republicans could use reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations, if the Republicans could use reconciliation to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, if the Republicans could use reconciliation to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw up to 32 million Americans off of the healthcare they have, we can and must use reconciliation to protect the needs of working families.

“We must use reconciliation to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

“Now is not the time for excuses. Now is not the time for more talk.  Now is the time for action.  Now is the time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”

Title: Sanders: Senate Republican Leadership Turned Their Backs on Working Families Today
Date: January 1, 2021
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, January 1 — Reacting to Senate Republicans’ refusal to provide unanimous consent for a motion by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) seeking up-or-down votes on two bills providing $2,000 in direct economic relief to working-class families today, including Majority Leader McConnell’s own proposal, Sanders issued the following statement:“Over the past four days I have asked, time and time again, for the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to vote on legislation that passed the House to provide a $2,000 direct payment to working class adults and their kids. This is legislation that Trump supports, Biden supports, and over two-thirds of the U.S. House supported — including 44 Republicans. In fact, a recent poll suggests that 78% of the American people support that approach. Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership have refused to allow the Senate to vote on this bill, even when accompanied by a vote on the bill which they themselves proposed.“At a time when so many Americans are facing economic desperation, it is tragic that the Republican leadership has turned their backs on the working families of this country. When the Biden Administration assumes office, the Senate must immediately take up and pass bold legislation which deals with the economic pain that so many Americans are experiencing.”Watch today’s floor remarks by Sandershere.

Title: Sanders Delivers Floor Speech Urging Senate to Pass $1,200 in Direct Relief to Working Class
Date: December 18, 2020
Subtitle: 

Content:
WASHINGTON, December 18 —Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) went to the Senate floor this afternoon to seek unanimous consent to pass legislation he had introduced earlier today to provide direct payments to working families across the United States.

Sanders’ proposal provides a direct payment of $1,200 for every working-class American, $2,400 for couples, and $500 for children. He was joined on the floor by Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who spoke in support of the legislation.

Sanders stated, “If this country means anything, if the U.S. government means anything, it means that we cannot turn our backs on that suffering, and that we cannot leave Washington for the holidays to go back to our families unless we address the pain and anxiety of other families throughout this country.”

Read the legislationhere.

Sanders’ speech can be watchedhere, and the prepared remarks can be read below:

“Mr. President, this country faces the worst set of public health and economic crises that we have faced in over a hundred years.

As a result of the pandemic more people are becoming infected than ever before.  Hospitalization is higher than ever before.  And more people are dying than ever before.  We all hope and pray that the new vaccine will be distributed as quickly as possible and that it will put an end to this nightmare.  But, today, the truth is that millions of low-income and middle class families are suffering in a way that we have not seen since the Great Depression.

Today, the reality is that over half of our workers are living paycheck to paycheck – trying to survive on $10 or $12 an hour.  The reality is that millions of senior citizens all over this country are trapped in their homes, unable to see their kids or grandchildren, unable to go to a grocery store, and are trying to survive on $12 or $14,000 a year.

In addition, millions more with disabilities are also suffering.

Further, in America today, one out of four workers are either unemployed or make less than $20,000 a year.  And, in the midst of this pandemic, because we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all, some 92 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured – unable to go to a doctor when they need to.

In addition, over 30 million of our people face eviction and the hunger rate in America is the highest it has been in decades.

Mr. President, that is where we are today economically.

And if this country means anything, if the U.S. government means anything, it means that we cannot turn our backs on that suffering, and that we cannot leave Washington for the holidays to go back to our families unless we address the pain and anxiety of other families throughout this country.

Members of Congress should also be aware that we are far behind other major countries in terms of protecting working families during this pandemic.  Not only, does every other wealthy country guarantee healthcare to all, as a human right, almost all of them are providing far more generous benefits to the unemployed and the struggling in their countries than we are.

Mr. President, several months ago I introduced legislation along with Senator Kamala Harris, now our vice president-elect, and Senator Markey, that, would during the course of this economic crisis, provide $2,000 a month to every working class person in this country.  And, frankly, that is exactly what we should be doing.

But, unfortunately, given the conservative nature of the Senate, I understand that is not going to happen.

Yes, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, at a time when huge corporations were making record breaking profits, the Republican leadership in the Senate was able to provide a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the 1% and large corporations.

Yes, at a time when climate change threatens the planet, the Congress was able to provide hundreds of billions in corporate welfare to the fossil fuel industry.

Yes, just the other day, the House and the Senate were able to pass a $740 billion military budget – the largest in history and more than the next ten nations combined.

But, in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Congress is somehow unable to respond effectively to the needs of working families.

Mr. President, as you know, I have recently introduced legislation to provide every working class American an emergency payment of at least $1,200, $2,400 for couples and $500 for their kids.

This is not a radical idea.  This is an approach that President Trump is supporting.  This is an approach that President-elect Biden is supporting.  This is an approach that, according to a recent poll, is supported by 75% of all Americans, including 77% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans.

Further, importantly, this amount of direct payment is exactly what Congress passed unanimously 9 months ago as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.

Let me repeat.  In March, every member of the House and Senate, appropriately, voted to provide a direct payment of $1,200 for working-class adults, $2,400 for couples and $500 for their kids.

Mr. President.  That was the right thing to do 9 months ago.  Given that the crisis, in many ways is worse today, it is exactly what we should be doing right now.

Mr. President, as a result of the pandemic, the government told restaurants, bars, retail stores, movie theaters, schools, malls and small businesses all over this country: Shut your doors.  It is too dangerous for you to be open now.

But what the government has not done, Mr. President, is to provide the workers who have lost their jobs and lost their incomes with the support they need to pay their bills.

The $600 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits that Congress passed unanimously in March expired in July – over 5 months ago.

And during that time – the Republican Senate has done nothing to help working families pay their rent, feed their families, go to a doctor or pay for their life-saving prescription drugs.  And, the Senate has not done enough to provide struggling small businesses with the help they desperately need.

Further, Mr. President, as bad as the economy has been in general it has been far worse for African Americans and Latinos.  During the pandemic, nearly 60% of Latino families and 55% of African American families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut.

Mr. President, for 9 months, we asked tens of millions of  working people in our country to survive on one $1,200 check – with no healthcare, no hazard pay, no rent relief. Nothing.

Meanwhile, Mr. President, I should mention that over this same 9 month period, 651 billionaires in America became over $1 trillion richer.

$1 trillion for billionaires.  One $1,200 check for the working class.  That is unconscionable. That is immoral and that has got to change.

Now, Mr. President, let us remember that way back in May, the House passed the $3.4 trillion HEROES Act which, among other things, included $600 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits and another direct payment of $1,200 for working class adults, $500 for their kids, and generous support for small businesses, hospitals, state and local governments and schools.

In other words, that $3.4 trillion bill was a serious effort to address the real crises facing this country.

I should also add that in July, the House passed another version of the bill – this one for $2.2 trillion.

That same month, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, proposed a $1.1 trillion bill that also provided a $1,200 direct payment for the working class and $500 for their children.

And then, in October, Secretary Mnuchin, in negotiations with Speaker Pelosi, proposed a COVID-relief plan for $1.8 trillion.

So, in the last number of months we have had major proposals of $3.4 trillion, $2.2 trillion, $1.8 trillion, and $1.1 trillion.

And yet today, after months of negotiating by the so-called gang of 8, we are now down to just a $908 billion bill that includes $560 billion in offsets in unused money from the CARES Act.

So, from an original House bill passed in May calling for $3.4 trillion in new money, we are now down to $348 billion in new money – roughly 10% of what Democrats thought we originally needed.

Mr. President, in my view, the $348 billion in new money is totally inadequate given the nature of the unprecedented crises that we face.

The American people cannot wait any longer. They need economic relief now.

Every working class American needs $1,200, $2,400 for couples and $500 for kids.

And let me be clear what I am talking about now is money that must not be taken from other important priorities like 16 weeks of supplemental unemployment benefits, aid for small business, nutrition, housing, education and the other important provisions in this bill.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 5063, which I introduced earlier today that would provide a $1,200 direct payment to every working class adult, $2,400 for couples and $500 for their children, that the bill be considered read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.”

Title: Over 2,000 Vermonters Join Sanders for Virtual Seniors Town Hall
Date: December 18, 2020
Subtitle: 

Content:
BURLINGTON – December 18 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders held a virtual town hall Thursday evening to provide an update from Congress and to hear the thoughts and concerns of older Vermonters.

Over 2,000 Vermont seniors joined Sanders for the town meeting which was held via phone call and streamed live on Sanders’ website. Each December, Sanders hosts holiday meals for seniors throughout the state. However, for everyone’s safety, this year’s event was held virtually. Sanders participated by video from his Senate office in Washington, D.C.

“Our senior meals and town meetings are always a highlight of the holiday season. While we couldn’t be together in person this year, I’m very pleased we had the opportunity to gather virtually,” said Sanders. “Especially at a time when many seniors are unable to be with friends and family, I thought it was important to continue this annual event and hear from my constituents about the issues that matter most to them, as well as the challenges they are facing.”

After Sanders’ introductory remarks, Vermonters asked questions on a wide range of issues. Areas of interest ranged from ways to expand and protect Medicare and Social Security, to struggles affording housing, heat, food, and prescription medications. With negotiations continuing in Congress, the COVID-19 relief package was on the minds of many who participated in the town hall. Many asked Sanders about the effort he is leading to ensure that a direct payment provision is included in the final relief bill, as well as his hope that Congress and a Biden Administration will continue to work on and pass additional, much-needed emergency relief in the new year. If approved, these direct payments to Vermonters would add about $350 million to the local economy.

“It’s interesting that all of the questions tonight touched on issues that millions and millions of people are struggling with. Whether it’s inadequate Social Security benefits, whether it’s the high cost of prescription drugs, whether it’s the housing crisis, whether it is student debt. Whether it is the inability of people to afford to keep warm in the winter time, you have asked exactly the questions that are on the minds of people all over this country,” said Sanders.

A few seniors on the call shared their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. One Vermonter expressed concerns about how the current economic crisis will affect their long-term financial stability, as well as their children’s, particularly considering they all are struggling with immense student loan debt. Paul from Johnson, VT said, “I’m committed to what I do for work, and I’m committed to my kids. Everything that I have surplus for savings, goes to my kids. In today’s economy, my oldest is unemployed because of the pandemic. My daughter is barely working. I have a parent plus loan and my kids have student loans. The payments are suspended right now because of the pandemic. I’m just ignoring it right now. I don’t need the stress.”

While another Vermonter from Williamstown, VT spoke of their difficulty affording basic necessities with their current monthly Social Security and veterans benefits totaling just $1,400, saying “I’m going to have to keep us going on a small check each month. It’s going to raise just about $12 this year. Where does that come out being fair at all?”

“This is America. People should not be hungry. People should not be homeless. People should not be unable to afford the medicine they need, not be in a position where they can’t afford to go to a doctor. This should not be happening,” said Sanders. “So the struggle that we face now is to change the priorities of this country to invest in ordinary people, so that all of us can live with dignity and enjoy life as we should be able to.”

Sanders ended the event by encouraging Vermonters to call his office should they need assistance, and promising to do everything possible in Washington to ensure Vermont seniors get the help they need when the need it. “I am very proud to fight in Congress on behalf of older Vermonters” said Sanders. “I wish everybody a very wonderful holiday season, and I’m sure that the new year is going to be a better one for all of us. I will hopefully be able to get to see you all in person in the not too distant future.”

Vermonters in need of assistance can reach Senator Sanders office by phone at 800-339-9834 or online at sanders.senate.gov.
